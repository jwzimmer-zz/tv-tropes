{"\nFlame bait is a post that is intended to start people bickering. Okay, maybe it doesn't have to be the intention, but it is certainly the result. Bickering begins.\nYou probably already knew that. It isn't a new term. We bring it up for selfish reasons. Wikis are not immune to flame wars. We'd like to head them off by limiting Flame Bait.\nHere is a list of things we call Flame Bait, the forbidden tropes, the ones that open the door to horrible things. Please don't list them anywhere, not even in YMMV tabs. Seriously. We're begging you. Don't do it, or you will be caught in the middle of an Internet Backdraft. These are things proven to start the bickering up.\nAdvertisement:\n Character Alignment (See The Great Character Alignment Debate for specific rules)\n Character Derailment\n Dethroning Moment of Suck\n Fallen Creator\n Fan Dumb\n Hatedom\n Hate Dumb\n Internet Backdraft\n Mary Sue\n 30-Sue Pileup\n Anti-Sue\n Black Hole Sue\n Canon Sue\n Copy Cat Sue\n Einstein Sue\n Fixer Sue\n God-Mode Sue\n Jerk Sue\n Marty Stu\n Mary Tzu\n Neutrality Sue\n Possession Sue\n Purity Sue\n Relationship Sue\n Suetiful All Along\n Sympathetic Sue\n Villain Sue\n Periphery Hatedom\n Ruined Forever\n Snark Bait\n So Bad, It's Horrible\n Unpleasable Fanbase\n\n": ['Character Alignment', 'The Great Character Alignment Debate', 'Character Derailment', 'Dethroning Moment of Suck', 'Fallen Creator', 'Fan Dumb', 'Hatedom', 'Hate Dumb', 'Internet Backdraft', 'Mary Sue', '30-Sue Pileup', 'Anti-Sue', 'Black Hole Sue', 'Canon Sue', 'Copy Cat Sue', 'Einstein Sue', 'Fixer Sue', 'God-Mode Sue', 'Jerk Sue', 'Marty Stu', 'Mary Tzu', 'Neutrality Sue', 'Possession Sue', 'Purity Sue', 'Relationship Sue', 'Suetiful All Along', 'Sympathetic Sue', 'Villain Sue', 'Periphery Hatedom', 'Ruined Forever', 'Snark Bait', "So Bad, It's Horrible", 'Unpleasable Fanbase']}
