{'\n"I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this Cosmos, in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky."\n— Carl Sagan\nUseful notes on a variety of subjects, the purpose of which is threefold:\n To debunk common media stereotypes.\n To help you understand some media better.\n To educate, inform, and sometimes entertain.\nThe Law of Wiki Expansion states that every specialized wiki will accumulate useful notes like these as it grows. Note, however, that this is not supposed to be an index of everything that exists in the real world — that is the purview of The Other Wiki. We are a site about media and storytelling. As a rule of thumb, items to be added should either be commonly featured in media, or related to its creation and distribution in some way.\nAdvertisement:Useful Notes articles are not tropes and are not to be included in a work\'s trope list. See, however, Historical Domain Character. Similarly, tropes are not to be used to describe the subject of a Useful Notes article directly. You may, however, list tropes that are commonly found in media portraying the subject.\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0open/close all folders\xa0 \n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Animation\xa0\n Anime & Manga\n Anime Fan Speak\n Names to Know in Anime\n Animators\n History of Animation\n Early Animation\n The Silent Age of Animation\n The Golden Age of Animation\n The Dark Age of Animation\n The Renaissance Age of Animation\n The Millennium Age of Animation\n Animation Resources\n Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Filmography\n Looney Tunes in the \'30s\n Looney Tunes in the \'40s\n Looney Tunes in the \'50s\n Looney Tunes in the \'60s\n Looney Tunes in the \'70s (and Onward)\n Looney Tunes Webtoons\n The 50 Greatest Cartoons\n The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes\n Noteworthy Disney Staff\n Noteworthy Fleischer Staff\n Noteworthy Looney Tunes Staff\n Noteworthy MGM Cartoon Staff\n Supermarionation\n Visual Novel Fanspeak\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Arts (Painting, Sculpting, Photography, Performance)\xa0\n Album Cover Designers\n Artists\n The Auteur Theory\n Dada\n Graphical Perspective\n Peking Opera\n Photographers\n Theater\n Broadway and the West End\n Fringe Festival\n Shakespearean Actors\n\nAdvertisement:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Business\xa0\n Apple\n Bitcoin\n British Businesses\n Business Organizations\n Copyright\n Kmart\n Sony\n Space "X"\n Trademark\n Walmart\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Comics\xa0\n Argentine Comics\n Belgian Comics\n British Comics\n Comic Books\n Comic Book Companies\n Comic Book Creators\n Dutch Comics\n Franco-Belgian Comics\n Manga\n Manga Demographics\n Mangaka\n U.S./Canadian Comics\n The Ages Of Super Hero Comics\n The Golden Age of Comic Books\n The Interregnum\n The Comics Code\n The Silver Age of Comic Books\n The Bronze Age of Comic Books\n The Dark Age of Comic Books\n The Iron Age of Comic Books\n Post-Crisis\n The Great Comics Crash of 1996\n The Modern Age of Comic Books\n Marvel Comics Editors In Chief\n Marvel Comics Events\n DC Comics Events\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Culture\xa0\n All Hallows\' Eve\n Arab World\n Awards Index\n Broadway and the West End\n Cultural Cringe\n Cyber Goth\n Fringe Festival\n Funerals\n Furry Fandom\n Graffiti\n Green Is Blue\n Great Dickens Christmas Fair\n Hat Shop\n Interacting with Persons Different Than Yourself\n The Irish Diaspora\n Juggalo\n Kawaisa\n Kimono\n Lolita Fashion\n Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade\n Meditation\n Memetics\n Mexican Americans\n Naming Conventions\n Patronymic\n Nudism\n Otherkin\n Pride Parade\n Skinheads\n Society for Creative Anachronism\n Subcultures\n Turkic Peoples\n Whovians\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Economics\xa0\n Capitalism\n Economics\n Economic Theories\n Homelessness\n Inflation And Exchange Rates\n Socialism\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Education\xa0\n British Unis\n Oxbridge\n GCSEs\n Ivy League\n Law School Admission Test (LSAT) \n Phillips Exeter Academy\n SATs\n School Systems\n Senior Exam Results Comparison Page\n Tokyo University\n University of Michigan\n\nAdvertisement:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Film\xa0\n 3-D Movie\n 3-D Projection\n Actors\n Comic Actors\n Franchise Actors\n Voice Actors\n American Film Institute\n Biker Media\n British Film Institute\n Directors\n Dogme 95\n Double Acts and Groups\n Film Formats\n French New Wave\n History of Hollywood\n Hollywood Accounting\n Home Video Distributors\n List of Films You Should See By the Age of 14\n Mormon Cinema\n Motion Picture Association of America\n Must See Movies Before You Grow Up\n Screenwriters\n Short Film\n Visual Effects Artists\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Folklore & Mythology\xa0\n Aboriginal Australian Myths\n Abrahamic Mythology and Sacred Literature (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim)\n The Bible -
