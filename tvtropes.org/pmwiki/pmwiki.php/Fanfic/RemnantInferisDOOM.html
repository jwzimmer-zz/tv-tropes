Armor is routinely shown to be highly useful for survival. The Slayer's armor tanks several blows that would outright kill any normal Aura-enhanced human, and the students are given more practical combat armor as part of their uniforms. Even Ozpin's suit is lined with armor, which protected him from an unexpected sword strike when he was trying to save one of his students. When Yang's Aura is completely drained, she would have been killed had she not been wearing her armor to tank the attacks she couldn't at the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: Weiss got angry at the Slayer for calling her father a "corporate asshole".

The only one to avert this so far is Marv Talg, who's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Depraved Bisexual</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>:<ul><li> The White Fang members that the Slayer killed in the opening really had a gory death coming.</li><li> The Faunus racists that the cultists sacrifice also deserved their fate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAssimilator">The Assimilator</a>: The demons merge their bodies with the technology of the worlds they conquer.

However, how he deals with the problem is so brutal that people are less inclined to like him than the actual bullies. It was so brutal that Weiss honestly didn't see any take-away or lesson to be learned from it; the whole thing just came across as a tall psycho beating people up without receiving any repercussions.

Ruby's difficulties with people stem from her being socially awkward while the Slayer's stem from a desire to be alone from others. Ruby is an idealist where the Slayer is a cynic. Ruby's love for weapons is rooted in admiration of them while the Slayer just loves any destructive weapon that he can use to kill things with (and Weiss notes that he treats the weapons in his arsenal with more care than he treats <em>actual people</em>).</li><li> The Slayer and Ozpin are both long-lived beings who have been fighting wars against their arch-foes for millennia. The Slayer prefers to go out and physically destroy his enemies with his bare hands, where as Ozpin is more behind-the-scenes in how he eliminates potential threats. While the Doom Marine is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> who rushes in, kills whatever gets in his way, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">plans things as he goes along</a>, Ozpin prefers meticulous, long-term plans for how to deal with his enemies.

The Battle against Hell, as well as war in general, is no place for those who balk at the sight of blood. When he was training Teams RWBY and JNPR and told Yang to do her hair up and she objects, he pulls her hair to prove a point. Long hair is <em>very</em> easy to grab and exploit as a weakness in a fight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheMoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheMoralityPet">Kick the Morality Pet</a>: While Ruby is one of the few people the Slayer is nice to, he can be downright mean to her every now and then. The most frequent example being how he lambastes her aspirations of being a Huntress and tells her to give up. Granted, he's doing so to prevent her from living a life of death and misery (or turn out like him), but it's still pretty cruel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneeCapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneeCapping">Knee Capping</a>: The Slayer shoots Adam in the knee with his energy pistol.

When Ruby first came into contact with it at the Cathedral of Marysville, she immediately started feeling <em>boundless agony</em>. Blake's thought process describes it as if someone managed to burn her very soul. The Slayer points out that a part of the reason is due to Aura being a defense shield for people on Remnant. A soul needs to be protected by the body, not the other way around. People from Remnant can use certain Argent power-ups like the Berserk sphere or Quad-damage, but they have negative side effects on them, such as Jaune now hearing the voices of the demons after he uses the Berserk sphere and Blake nearly having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">Heroic RRoD</a> after using the Quad-damage sphere.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">The Legions of Hell</a>: Following their failed invasion of Mars, the Slaves of Doom now have their sights on Remnant.

He doesn't tell the Slayer anything in regards to the Relics due to certainty that he would destroy them to keep their power out of the hands of Hell and Salem. Given that both he and VEGA suggest killing the Maidens when he learns that Salem desires their power, it's not completely unfounded. Ozpin also tries to keep Ruby from learning anything about her Silver-Eyes, and has Qrow prevent the Slayer from telling her anything. This aspect frustrates the Slayer a lot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsAWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsAWeakness">Love Is a Weakness</a>: William's maternal grandfather despised the fact that his parents were raising him in a way that he was nurtured and loved, as he found those concepts to be weaknesses that Night Sentinels should never have.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M - Q&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>: The Slayer thinks of Ozpin as one after he intentionally rigged the teams so that they would end up in a specific way.

He would rather let himself be captured by Atlas rather than risk killing their soldiers that have nothing to do with his revenge. He was also horrified when he believed he hurt a young girl in his fight with Neo (it was actually one of Emerald's illusions). However, if said "innocents" just so happen to be working for people involved in horrific experiments on humans and Faunus, then he has no mercy towards even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">rent-a-cops</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence">Nightmare Sequence</a>: Fighting Hell starts to take its toll on Team RWBY, and each of them start having horrific nightmares.<ul><li> Ruby has a disturbing one involving a mutilated, deformed version of her mother trying to drown her in a pit of blood and gore; condemning her for following in the Huntress' lifestyle.</li><li> Weiss dreams that she loses her fight against the Gigas first seen in the <em>White</em> trailer, her father Jacques sells Atlas out to Hell and she's dragged away by two Imps wearing SDC vests.</li><li> Blake has nightmares of the Slayer killing off all of the White Fang, including her father and Ilia.</li><li> <em>Cinder</em> of all people has one, remembering her parents summoning Demons that proceeded to kill them and all the other cultists, with her being the only survivor of the attack due to Salem being the one who saved her.</li><li> Yang has one where an Imp's arm thrusts out of the pancake batter Summer was making and kills her in front of the child Yang.

The demons are actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the scattered soul fragments of humans when they were wiped out by the God of Darkness in the pre-Remnant genocide</span>, with their undying hatred warping their surroundings in the void to become Hell and twisting their forms to the point where they are no longer what they once were.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>: Ironwood, Qrow, Weiss and Winter don't really trust the Slayer due to his blood-lust, violent nature, and willingness to do anything to destroy the Slaves of Doom. Qrow in particular views him as more of a threat because of the latter reason, as it means that if killing them would lead to Hell's destruction, then he's certain the Slayer would do it without question. Ozpin <em>relies</em> on the Slayer since he's the most effective when it comes to fighting Hell, but actively keeps him out of the loop in regards to certain things like the Relics. This is because he's certain that the Slayer will do everything he can to destroy them if it means denying Hell the power they possess.
