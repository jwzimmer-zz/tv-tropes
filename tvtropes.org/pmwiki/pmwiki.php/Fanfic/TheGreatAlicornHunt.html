The latter has to do with Unicorn nesting instinct making them build high up, rather than to deliberately exclude Earth Ponies and Pegasi due to being respectively higher and lower than they'd like, and in the case of the former, it's because Mach can't conceive that perhaps non-Pegasi just might not be comfortable living in the cloud city on account that they can't fly. He misses this point even after calling out how impractical living in Cloudsdale really is on account of having absolutely no farmlands to grow food on and basically relying on importing food grown on the ground.

Add to that the stigma of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> stereotype, and she looks like an easy target for a smear campaign, right?

That being said, the fact that they're <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">alicorns</a></em> means that what little magic they do have is <em>insanely</em> powerful (case in point: Fluttershy's Stare originally didn't work on Discord; once she's ascended, it blows out his eyes and leaves him with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshFace">Ash Face</a>, cowing him rather neatly).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnaturallyLoopingLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnaturallyLoopingLocation">Unnaturally Looping Location</a>: In chapter 54, Pinkie Pie is furious at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">soon-to-be ex-Mayor Fussbudget for giving Mach One a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; cake instead of a real birthday cake</span>.

This is what kicks off the main plot of the story &mdash; to find more Alicorns and eventually find a way to pass the gift of immortality on to everypony.<ul><li> When Mach seems hesitant to ascend, Rainbow Dash asks if he believes in this trope, directly quoting it and even calling him an emo for it.
