Beauty is not the issue &mdash; she is a beautiful girl, but she chases Shinji <em>obsessively</em>, even though Shinji has already said he is not interested and he very obviously likes another girl (and Chihiro <em>is</em> aware of that). In addition, Chihiro treats him like a prize to be won (which he hates), and when she tries to flirt with him she disses Asuka and Rei (which he <em>really</em> hates).</li><li> Asuka <em>had</em> a horde of boys chasing her as well. In chapter 8, she points out the differences with how she and Shinji handled their unwanted admirers:<div class="indent"><strong>Shinji:</strong> Maybe that will finally get them to stop chasing me like I'm a prize to be won. [...] How come I'm the one with the pack after them? You were ten times as popular as I was, a week after you arrived, miss incredibly-hot-exotic-foreign-transfer-student. I know Touji and Kensuke were making crazy amounts of cash selling beauty shots of you almost right away. Why haven't I had to chase away a pack of boys drooling after you? <br><strong>Asuka:</strong> Because I already had them properly terrified and respectful after I mashed the first two flat when they tried to ask me out the week I got here and refused to take 'no' for an answer, [...] Putting a couple of them on the ground with a few punches when they got rough taught the others to keep off.

Even so, Shinji and Asuka tried to resist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: During their conversations, Shinji tells Asuka how he was abandoned by his father only to be called ten years later because his father needed him to pilot a giant robot; and Asuka explains to Shinji how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart">her father cheated on her mother</a>, and after her demise he married his mistress and refused to take care of his own four-year-old daughter.

Oh, and he also thought Shinji's feelings towards Asuka were unrequited infatuation. Ordinarily, this would be correct- this was indeed the status of things in the canon timeline and a reasonable assumption of how things could have gone. However: the dummy plugs were NOT a good enough substitute; Shinji and Asuka's relationship was of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> nature, and it had been resolved unbeknownst to him, so neither of them cared for or depended on his approval anymore.
