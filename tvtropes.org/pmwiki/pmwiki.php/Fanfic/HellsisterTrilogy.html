I do this, not for evil, but for the greater good. A greater good than any of these fools can understand. And it is for this reason that I must do... what I must do. I think this may be love.

His partner Dawnstar doesn't get over his death but she eventually starts a relationship with another person.

The Golem lived on what Luthor termed "galactic energy", which power boosted his considerably beyond Superman&#146;s.

All I'm asking for is a fair exchange. If you heal Kara, you can have the rock with my compliments. If you don't... If you don't, I could say that we'd tear the place up and fight you, and we're pretty strong in our own right. But that wouldn't get us what we want, and we'd probably lose in the long run.

I'm going to find me a planet, one with people on it, lots and lots of people. And I'm going to kill them all. Then I'm going to another planet, and kill just, maybe, half of them. And I'll make the ones who live worship me. By the time I find my child, he may be the object of a new religion.

As for &#145;Forever People', it is simply a term Orion once used in derision towards Moonrider's family group, which they adopted. Just as we are known among some of your kind as... 'New Gods'." Highfather looked discomfited by the phrase.</div></li><li> As he was trapped in a star, Wildfire tried to communicate with the inhabitants of the closest planet. Unfortunately, when he explained he was a guy in the Sun above, some people thought he was a god, despite his best efforts to explain the matter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg">Ain't Too Proud to Beg</a>: Black Adam reacts violently when Mordru orders him to submit to him... and then promptly falls on his knees and begs to be spared when Mordru proves he can destroy him at any given time.<div class="indent">Calmly, the bearded giant on the throne before him answered, "I am Mordru. You have been brought here to serve me." <br>Angrily, the black-and-gold-clad villain launched himself at Mordru. His power and velocity should have carried him straight through the wizard's body. <br>But Mordru raised a hand, and a lightning bolt sprang from his fingers. Black Adam was knocked out of the air. A flash of energy almost blinded Mordru's messenger. <br>Now, a slim Egyptian man with no powers whatever cowered on the floor of Mordru's chamber. And the over-villain's hand still glowed with eldrich power. <br>"Spare me!" begged Teth-Adam, who would never have spared a foe himself. <br>"Agree to serve me, then," said Mordru, not giving an iota. <br>Teth-Adam knelt before his new master, touching his forehead to the floor three times.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneMook">Airborne Mook</a>: Darkseid deploys legions of bat-winged parademons in order to deter the heroes.

Linda guessed that, if she took that time into account, she could probably celebrate her birthday six months early. Well, at least she could return in time to only a few seconds after she departed. That way she wouldn't be late for work.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">You Are Not Alone</a>: When Colossal Boy and Supergirl are about to walk into literal Hell in a desperate bid to stop Mordru, Colossal Boy notices his partner is upset and frightened so he hurries to cite a bit of Scripture to remind her she is not alone, now or never.<div class="indent">Gim looked at Supergirl. She was as brave a warrior as he'd ever known, but nobody was totally fear-free. He was coping by putting most of what they had to do out of his conscious mind. He put a reassuring arm about her shoulder. <br>"There's a thing Rabbi Tuchman used to tell us in temple," he said. "&#145;If we stand, God is with us. If we fall, God is still with us. So don't be afraid to fall, but do everything you can to stand.'" <br>She smiled with the corner of her mouth. "Thank your rabbi for me. I'm not chickening out, Gim, don't worry. Let's join the others."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">You Are Too Late</a>: At the climax of "The Apokolips Agenda", a group of heroes led by Superman bursts into Darkseid's stronghold, but it's too late: Darkseid's already learned the Anti-Life Equation and they can't stop him from speaking it. Darkseid's plan fails, though, because Supergirl manages to hypnotize Highfather's daughter into speaking the opposite Equation, thus cancelling Darkseid's universe-wide mind-control wave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanBarelyStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanBarelyStand">You Can Barely Stand</a>: Still physically and emotionally exhausted after fighting Mordru in Hell, Supergirl is teleported right in front of her omnicidal, psychotic evil counterpart Satan Girl. Supergirl doesn't know how she can walk out of that battle alive, let alone win, but she manages to survive her evil duplicate's relentless assault and hurl her into an antimatter star.<div class="indent">She was tired, on the brink of exhaustion, emotionally wrung-out after the trip to the Netherworld and the fight with Mordru. Now, to be flung against a fresh, raging Satan Girl...it was simply too much. <br>It was hard enough fighting her when she had been prepared and in good condition. How in the hell was she supposed to win against her now?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>: When Kara states aloud she would like nothing more than to be a normal girl from Argo City, Kal reminds her that there is sadly no Argo City to return to, anymore.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne">You Can't Thwart Stage One</a>: The second story arc sees Darkseid successfully learning and speaking the Anti-Life Equation, in spite of the opposition of a veritable army of heroes, before he gets defeated by Orion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouExclamation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouExclamation">"You!" Exclamation</a>: Satan Girl when Supergirl calls her a weak, pathetic copy.<div class="indent">&lt;Oh, will you?&gt;, asked Kara. &lt;I thought for certain that you wanted to tear me apart with your own hands. Except it hasn't been that easy, has it? Maybe you're just not up to it, after all... since you're just a pretty pathetic copy of me.&gt; <br>Satan Girl's expression of hatred, which was about the only one she owned, intensified. &lt;YOU...&gt; she began, and that was all she could get out.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood">You Could Have Used Your Powers for Good</a>: Supergirl tells her old enemy Blackstarr she could have used her vast cosmic powers to help people instead of hurting them. Blackstarr replies she doesn't believe she is capable of making a difference.<div class="indent"><strong>Supergirl:</strong> You&#146;ve got powers that even I and Kal can&#146;t command. You&#146;re part of one of the greatest heritages on our planet, whether you admit it or not. You could use your abilities to help, rather than hurt. Instead of wasting them in this stupid battle... you could do something with them that could make your mother proud. And you could be a heroine. <br><strong>Blackstarr:</strong> No. That would be futile. All it would give us is the same inefficiency. The same world, divided among hundreds of worthless governments. The same disunity, and the same inability to bring man forward, into Overman.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Hoping to avoid this scenario, Satan Girl seduces Mordru.<div class="indent">She might have to watch out for him, as well. If she were viewed as a tool, he might intend to simply use her and destroy her once the job was finished. How could she guard against that?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">You Killed My Father</a>: Berserker blames Supergirl for his mother's death, regardless of the fact that Kara killed her evil duplicate in self-defense:<div class="indent"><strong>Berserker:</strong> I will avenge my mother&#146;s death. I will avenge your honor. I will make her pay for blocking the True Path. I WILL DESTROY THE SUPERGIRL.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">Your Head A-Splode</a>:<ul><li> It happens when Doctor Fate fights Superman's enemy Lord Satanis. Let's say that Fate's Order magic doesn't mix well with Satanis' Chaos-powered headgear.<div class="indent">Fate put his hands to his helmet, lifted it off, and, swooping low, jammed it over the red helmet of his enemy. The power of Order, imbued within the golden helm, had an immediate reaction with the powers within Satanis's headgear. <br>There was an explosion everyone could hear, and what happened to Lord Satanis was not at all pretty to look upon. <br>Kent Nelson, standing in his blue and gold uniform, hesitated a second. Then he reached out, separated his own helmet from Satanis's, and replaced it on his head. Thankfully, it contained no baleful energies. He then took Satanis&#146;s helmet. It came away from his body, with what was left of his head inside.</div></li><li> In "Hellspawn", Nemesis sends a surge of energy through the body of Duplicate Man which causes his head to explode.<div class="indent">Nemesis grabbed his left hand, grinned, and pressured it hard, sending a burst of mystic energy through it. <br>Ord Quelu screamed in pain, despite himself. He added the strength of a Kryptonian, tried to take on the power of an impossibly powerful mage. <br>But it wasn't enough. <br>Just as Duplicator reached the two of them, Duplicate Man's head exploded. It showered his son's body in a terrible moment of gore.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMagicsNoGoodHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMagicsNoGoodHere">Your Magic's No Good Here</a>: Supergirl lures her evil duplicate into the anti-matter universe, where their invulnerability doesn't work and Kara has a chance to destroy Satan Girl.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourUniverseOrMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourUniverseOrMine">Your Universe or Mine?</a>: Kara travels from late 20th Century to 30th Century to rejoin the Legion and falls in love with Dev-Em. Unfortunately, Dev hates the 20th Century, so they visit each other on weekends. Considering such an arrangement cannot last, though, Kara decides she can move to the future permanently as long as she can travel back to the present whenever she pleases.<div class="indent">The last couple of weekends he had spent with her in the 20th. Now, she'd have to pay him back by visiting the 30th, this weekend and next. It was a weird form of romance, to be certain. But Dev-Em, who had started out as an enemy of Superboy's before going to the future, going straight, and becoming a spy, had satisfied her as no other man ever had. Both in bed, and in her heart. <br>But what could she do with this romance? <br>Linda flopped down on the side of the bed, her black-and-orange suit still in hand. True, she loved Dev more than any man in her life. But neither one had offered to give up his or her time-era for the other, yet. Dev hadn't agreed to marriage yet, and she was reluctant to bring it up. <br>How could she leave the 20th, and her natural and adoptive parents? <br>How could he leave the 30th, with his espionage work for the United Planets and the Legion?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntLikeMeWhenImAngry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntLikeMeWhenImAngry">You Wouldn't Like Me When I'm Angry</a>: Kara's as kind-hearted as temperamental. And she can bring a mountain down with a single punch. Threaten innocent people or hurt her family and even if you were Darkseid himself she'll do her best to beat you to a bloody pulp.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroGSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroGSpot">Zero-G Spot</a>: Satan Girl is a Kryptonian clone and Mordru a powerful sorcerer, so a lack of atmosphere is no trouble whatsoever. Hence Satan Girl takes Mordru out of the planet in the fifth chapter and demands to be taken right there and then.</li></ul><hr><div class="indent"><strong>Supergirl:</strong> Well, it's gonna have to start coming somewhere else before long. I'm tired of this. I wasn't born to be a, a super-heroine. I just wanted to be a normal girl from Argo, and, and get a good job and a good man and settle down...</div><hr>
