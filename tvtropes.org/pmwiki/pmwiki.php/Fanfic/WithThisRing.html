The most prominent alternate is the Renegade, identified by the chapter timestamp appearing in red text, who started out similarly to the main timeline, but started making more direct and ruthless choices, leading to increasing divergence until the two storylines are almost entirely different. Most episodes include at least a chapter or two from the Renegade timeline, and there have been several episodes that are Renegade-first with occasional chapters from the original timeline.</p><p>The story is currently on its fourteenth thread, and has a story-only thread.

Surgeons: gone. Anesthetists: gone. Critical care nurses: gone. Any child who was undergoing surgery when the separation occurred is most likely already dead. Most children who were in critical care wards will be dying without the constant attention they need.
