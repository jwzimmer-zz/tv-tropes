It's used to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting">Monochrome Casting</a>, but for some characters, you have no clue what ethnicity or race they are just by looking at them. Are they a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">light-skinned black person</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown">Latin American</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NativeAmericans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NativeAmericans">Native American</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani">Romani</a>?

Their facial features don't correspond to any particular race either, as is often the case in highly stylized animation, so it's unknown. They're just brown.
</p><p>This can be especially confusing in animated works, where it may be unclear whether it's a true example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki">a random and common appearance</a>, a non-specific visual shorthand the creators liked or perhaps a stylized attempt to actually portray a real ethnicity. Or even if the design is visually inspired by something totally different rather than having a basis in real life. The character in question is also usually the only person in the entire show with this appearance, making it especially strange.

</p><p>Note this is generally a fandom issue and happens whether or not the debate is even relevant to the character. Expect a lot of assumptions of how ethnicities only look a particular way. You can pretty much give up all hope of identifying their backgrounds if they're in a fantasy world, especially one that goes light on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">recognizable cultural counterparts</a>.

</li><li> The character or culture must have no real life racial stereotype.

</p><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> since brown in its various shades is statistically the most common human skin color&mdash;and also because there are some "brown" people who are able to pass (sometimes just barely) for lighter colors, so if they change their names and don't emphasize that heritage, you might not ever get to know just what they are.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaysGreatEthnics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaysGreatEthnics">Plays Great Ethnics</a> is for when <em>actors</em> are ambiguously brown and can play a wide variety of ethnicities.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceInBorderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceInBorderland">Alice in Borderland</a></em>, several characters such as Takeru Danma/Boshiya, Aguni Morizono, Ginji Kyuma and Hikari Kuina look like someone from Caribbean islands or southern parts of Africa rather than a natural Japanese person. This is understandable due to the art style used by the author.
</li><li> Athena from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Aria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Aria">Aria</a></em> is an example.
</li><li> The English version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</a></em> has Julie Makimoto, a girl from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">Eagle Land</a> who has dark skin and white hair. While her build and face seem to imply African, when compared to Komba (who is <em>confirmed</em> African) and considering her last name is Japanese, it's surprisingly open to interpretation. In the original Japanese, she is Australian (implied to be Aboriginal) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">and her last name is Hayward</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Casca has medium brown skin, straight black hair, and a face type that's pretty unclear about her origins. For years fans have been arguing with each other over whether she's supposed to be black, Arab, East Indian, Southern European, mixed, or just about any other real-life brown race you can think of. <em>Berserk</em> does have races in the story who resemble black Africans and South Asians, but Casca looks ambiguous enough that she can't be indisputably categorized with either. It's entirely possible that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KentaroMiura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KentaroMiura">Kentaro Miura</a> just wanted to give her a unique appearance without having a particular intention about her race, since he hasn't commented on the issue. Making matters even more muddled, the <em>Golden Age</em> film trilogy and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk2016">Berserk (2016)</a></em> depict Casca's skin as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">much lighter shade of tan</a> than in the manga, while making her hair dark brown or reddish-brown instead of black.
</li><li> Pippin is also ambiguously brown skinned like Casca but unlike her, Pippin has prominent lips suggesting he is of a different ethnicity and none of the adaptations change his skin tone. Corkus has notable darker skin in the 97 anime, but like Casca is whitened up in the movies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yoruichi Shih&#333;in, pictured above, is one of the quintessential examples, so much so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> compromised on "dark-skinned" to end an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/EditWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/EditWar">Edit War</a> over her ethnicity. It's not relevant to the story so it's never mentioned. The fact that she can transform into a black cat only added more fuel to the fire. While one of the anime outros implies that she's black, there's no official word concerning her ethnicity, though given her name as well as having a brother named Yushiro, she's at the very least partially Japanese.
</li><li> In the anime, Mila-Rose is made very dark-skinned, as is her superior, Tier Harribel. In the manga, Mila-Rose is paler and Tier Harribel seems to be a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganguro">ganguro<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Of course, given that arrancars are humanoid amalgamations of souls, it may be debatable if they even technically <em>have</em> a race.
</li><li> Jackie Tristan is dark-skinned with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddNameOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddNameOut">Odd Name Out</a> in a series filled with Japanese characters. Ethnicity isn't very important for most characters in the story, so hers is never discussed.
</li></ul></li><li> Kojiro Hyuga/Mark Lenders from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em>. Spanish fans use to joke saying that Lenders was the first/only Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani">Gypsy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaroleAndTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaroleAndTuesday">Carole &amp; Tuesday</a></em>, Carole seems to be of African descent, while Angela could either be African as well or Latino, maybe both. This is quite prominent, as Alba City is very cosmopolitan and the colonization of Mars might have blurred a few "racial" lines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>:
<ul><li> Villetta Nu is from the Britannian Empire, but since it geographically covers not only the USA but all of Central and South America as well it could account for the wide variety of skin tones among its members.
</li><li> Dorothea Ernst is slightly darker than Villetta and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">killed off</a> after only a few minutes of screen time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">Dalque</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassNightmareOfNunnally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassNightmareOfNunnally">Nightmare of Nunnally</a></em> is from one of the numbered areas, but it's never revealed which one.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade">Death Parade</a></em>, Castra has dark brown skin and Ginti is noticeably darker than the rest of the cast as well. Neither are human like the others (they deal with the afterlife) and so like them they don't seem to have a particular race.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> has Kabru, Kiki and Kaka. All the people in Kabru's village had the same dark skintone, but we're never actually told where the village was. The series hasn't revealed anything about Kiki and Kaka's past before they were adopted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeltoraQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeltoraQuest">Deltora Quest</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jasmine is described in the having sunbrown skin in the books and the anime surprisingly matches it especially <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTUhnyGfd5WzrpFq4p91wbwt8XLicyBUOsehgA7CT_IKM454XWZlA">compared<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to the other characters). The exact reason why Jasmine's skin is like this is debatable, most likely is because she has lived outdoors for most of life or possibly she inherited her pigment from her father as well as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">green</a> hair which was not in the books.
</li><li> Doom the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Rebel Leader</a> is described as tan skinned in the books and he's even darker in the anime, easily more brown than every other character.

This could easily be written off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleHairColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleHairColor">Implausible Hair Color</a>, especially since the Japanese protagonist looks like <em><a class="urllink" href="https://dr-stone.fandom.com/wiki/Senku_Ishigami?file=Senku%20Ishigami%20Anime%20Infobox.png">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>,</em> until said protagonist notes that they <em>obviously</em> must have foreign blood based on their appearances.
</li><li> Tom Tanaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> not only has noticeably darker skin than most characters but also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableHairstyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableHairstyle">dreadlocks</a>, and this combined with his first name raise the possibility that he has some non-Japanese ancestry. That, or he's just really tanned and has odd style habits.
</li><li> Raven from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/EarlAndFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/EarlAndFairy">Earl and Fairy</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Heroic Bastard</a> half-brother of a clearly white Ermine, meaning that he's half British, and his other half is eventually revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a demon</span>. His appearance is also used to show the discrimination obviously non-Anglo people in Victorian England faced.
</li><li> Raoh and Kaioh in the Toei adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> become this, in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">Adaptation Dye-Job</a> gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> (in the original manga and all non-Toei adaptations, both of them are white with silver hair).
</li><li> Rose and most people in her town are this way in the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> anime. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">manga</a> and <em>Brotherhood</em>, the town is a mountain town full of light-skinned people; however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">in the 2003 anime</a>, it's a desert town. They're darker than most other characters, but this is never commented upon by anyone. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">skirmish involving them</span> is comparable to the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ishvalan Massacre</span>.

It's implied that the people of Rose's town are related to or possibly descended from Ishvalans.
</li><li> Alex Benedetto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gangsta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gangsta">Gangsta.</a></em> has rich brown skin, long black hair and an accent. Yet she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and her brother Emilio</span> don&#146;t really resemble the other black characters in the series. The police chief Chad Adkins reveals Alex is Blasian, specifically a mix of Chinese and African.
</li><li> Rally Vincent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em>. Her mother was British and her father is either Indian or Pakistani, although his already very dark tone suggests South Indian heritage.
</li><li> A few characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei">Haibane Renmei</a></em> are Ambiguously White. Kuu and Hikari are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhenotypeStereotype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhenotypeStereotype">blue-eyed blondes</a> in a cast predominantly made up of dark-eyed brunettes. However, their names are still Japanese and nothing is noted in-series about their designs. The characters all name themselves, which explains their names, and they all have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> about their pasts. It's implied that the characters live in purgatory, which makes everything more ambiguous. Kuramori and Hyouko have dark hair and blue eyes as well, which might imply the characters are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki">Mukokuseki</a> or might imply otherwise.
</li><li> Almost all the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HareGuu">Har&eacute;+Guu</a></em> have dark skin. In fact lighter skin characters are a little rare in the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> as it takes in a jungle, likely somewhere in south Asia. Oddly enough <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Weda came from "the city"</span>, where Har&eacute; goes later and more or less everybody is white-ish. She still has the exact same appearance of the other inhabitants of the jungle. So... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that was some lucky choice for a place to be banished.</span>
</li><li> Jan Valentine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> is pretty dark skinned. However, it becomes really ambiguous in light of his brother, who is whiter than this page background. Sir (Lady) Integra and Father Andersen are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">Dark-Skinned Blond</a>, though in the anime TV series, it is directly implied that Integra's mother is actually Indian, as she was both darker-skinned than her husband and wearing a sari in the family photo taken when Integra was a baby.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Enrico Pucci</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> looks black, but it's actually an important plot point that he's not. His parents are both white as snow. Given that he's of Italian descent, he may be Sicilian and his dark skin a product of recessive genes.
</li><li> Kaolla Su from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>. Her origins aren't revealed until towards the final chapters (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's from a fictional country on the International Date Line</span>), but her appearance was actually relevant to a subplot involving Keitaro assuming she was from India (which she denied).
</li><li> Goemon Ishikawa and Inspector Zenigata of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> went back and forth on this one in the early years.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII">Goemon</a> was portrayed with tan skin early on for the original manga series and the pilot, had pale skin for the first TV series, and then went tan again for the first <em>Lupin</em> movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteryOfMamo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteryOfMamo">The Mystery of Mamo</a></em>, which was based on the original manga art. The second TV series returned to the pale tone, and he has kept it ever since. The argument would be because Goemon's nationality (Japanese) is the only one known of the gang and so it makes him stand out more ethnically. <em>Except</em>...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII">Zenigata</a> is also Japanese and was pale for the pilot, but got noticeably tan in the first TV series, the opposite of Goemon. He also has a slightly ruddy complexion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a></em>, but since then, has also evened out to paler tones.

Further complicated by the fact he's brown with dark hair, his brother is white with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">blue hair</a>, and his sister is white and freckly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead">red hair</a>. Probably explained by the fact that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">artificial humans</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">Mirko</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> is native to Japan but has noticeably dark skin. Her attack names tend to involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish">Gratuitous Spanish</a>, implying she's at least partially of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown">Latin American descent</a>. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDad">Rock Lock</a> who stands out as the first, and only, Afro-Japanese character in the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kidomaru">Kidomaru<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. On <a class="urllink" href="http://www.coverbrowser.com/image/bestselling-comics-2007/634-1.jp">the cover for Volume 24<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, his skin is even darker than it is in the anime (despite it being almost completely white in the regular pages, but that's a frequent occurrence in manga). Later, several characters from the Cloud Village are shown to be <em>unambiguously</em> black.
</li><li> Also Kakuzu, the dark-skinned, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a> using Akatsuki member.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has a few characters like this, though if you look at the original designs the "darkness" of some of the characters seem to come from the designers of the anime taking liberties.
<ul><li> In the main cast, there's Usopp, who also has creamy brown skin, kinky black hair and drawn lips (which most characters lack), and Oda said that if the Straw Hats were from the real world he would be from Africa, so he is most likely intended to. The Spanish dub of <em>One Piece</em> had Usopp talking in a heavy Arabic accent, plus he was renamed as Usuf. However, Usopp's mother Banchina was very pale, and had an Italian name, whereas his father has similar features including drawn lips. Also, while he now has blond dreadlocks, he was shown when Shanks first recruited him to have curly black hair, so it's likely he dyed/bleached it. This might point to Ussop being biracial.
</li><li> There's also Robin as a borderline example, whose skin looks slightly darker than most of the other Straw Hats but looks slightly tanned at most. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Oda stated in the SBS</a> that if the straw hats lived in the real world Robin would be from <em>Russia</em>. As of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, there isn't any Ambiguously Brown anymore. Her tanned skin is <em>gone</em>.
</li><li> Zoro has <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSD3qROJSkWek8Gi32EeOqB_izZJS8UcXh0tQ&amp;usqp=CAU">noticeable tanned skin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the anime and keeps this skin tone right up til the timeskip. Since Zoro nationality would be Japanese in real life it's likely just a heavy tan like Robin.
</li><li> Before his death Brook fit this trope, and even as a skeleton he still has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">awesome afro</a>.
</li><li> Kuzan aka Aokiji is also distinctly brown and has pronounced lips like Usopp and in Funimation dub has a low voice like a Jazz singer. But since Kuzan is based off a famous Japanese actor, it's likely just an animator's decision.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient">Panzer World Galient</a></em>: Redd Winduu was brown-skinned, but it is hard to tell what his race is supposed to be.
</li><li> Fakir in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em> has tan skin and dark green (almost black!) hair, in a town that appears to be set in Germany. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> states he has some Middle-Eastern blood in him (because of his name and appearances), but the creator tends to dodge the subject when a question is asked about it.
</li><li> Akio and Anthy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em>. Some believe that they're from India due to the forehead marking, though the fact that they may be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ancient gods or something very similar</span> makes things moot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sailor Pluto has significantly darker skin than her comrades, (it's lightened somewhat in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>).

</li><li> Kunzite in the original anime has darker skin than the other generals and noticably darker skin than his manga counterpart.
</li><li> Haruka's friend Elza Gray from the first anime. Her name would suggest her being of African American descent.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> has a cast of characters hail of very different countries and ethnicities. Good luck trying to ascertain the race of some of them, though. A good example is Chrysaor Krishna: he is from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SriLanka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SriLanka">Sri Lanka</a>, he is brown-skinned and white-haired.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>- technically, everyone is Japanese except for those explicitly designated as foreigners, but as part of the hip-hop style, there's a lot of darker skinned characters (often mooks) who often look black or Hispanic. In contrast, higher class characters have paler skin. Mugen looks Ambiguously Brown compared to the other main characters, which might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, since he's from <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands">the Ryuku Islands<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and it's traditional to draw Okinawans darker, and there has for decades been contention about whether they are to be recognized as a racial minority or not, and in the time the show is set, the king of Ryukyu was still paying tribute to the emperors of Japan and China as a subject state.
</li><li> Master samurai Kambei and Gorobei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiSeven">Samurai 7</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Kambei was originally intended to be deliberately distinctly African-looking in appearance but ended up being Southeast/Southwest Asian/Latin American. His original design was then used for Gorobei.
</li><li> Maria from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>. She's an illegal immigrant, but her country of origin was never specified. It's possibly intentional, since the series has another character who's also a generic foreigner (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhenotypeStereotype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhenotypeStereotype">a different variety</a>). Considering her brown skin color, Hispanicized real first name, illegal immigrant status, war-torn past, lack of formal education, and stereotypically genki personality, along with the fact that she's still supposed to be from "Asia", it is most likely that she is actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Filipina</a></em>, which would make sense considering the historical relationship and geographical proximity between the Philippines and Japan.
</li><li> Pick a guy, any guy, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> (except Keiichirou, any of the aliens, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Blue Knight/Deep Blue</span>). They're all incredibly tanned. What's more, Ryou's mother was <em>white</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">&forall; Gundam</a></em> is chock full of characters like this:

He doesn't really look like anything, but expect lots of jokes about "Black History Month" every February on /m/, anyway (it helps that he spends most of the first episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeCostumeReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeCostumeReference">dressed up as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrivingMissDaisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrivingMissDaisy">Hoke</a>).
</li><li> Guin Rhineford is fairly dark-skinned, too, but judging by his facial features and hair, he's probably just a white guy with a really deep tan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Meshy/Meshie/Miashe/Mia-Shay Kune/Kyuun</a>(/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Coo- whoah, let's not go with that romanization!</a>) Is yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">Dark-Skinned Blond</a>, but her facial features are pretty "black"-looking (very prominent lips for an anime character, for one). Her hair and complexion, along with the fact that her very white, hick-ish father is a minor character suggests she's supposed to be a mulatto, though we never see her mom.
</li><li> The Moonrace is considerably whiter (a few Asians, too), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> Agrippa looks like he's supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">But Not Too Black</a>.

This particular <em>Gundam</em> actually features a good number of dark-skinned characters, but Shakti is a bit odd considering her mother is extremely white, living in a society (Zanscare) of predominantly white-skinned people. No explanation for this is ever given (her father is never shown).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:

Lara, from Class 2-D gets away with it due to being explicitly stated to be Mexican, though somehow she has a Russian accent in the English dub.

Atsuko Jackson is explicitly half-black and half-Japanese but we never know for sure what Michiko's racial makeup is. Both women appear to be Afro-Latina (for those to whom this isn't immediately obvious, there is an episode in which Michiko wears her hair natural), Michiko being more likely to be considered "Zambo"&#151;as opposed to Atsuko's "Jambo"&#151;and the racial demographics of the show are surprisingly accurately represented. Characters in the series tend to have a mish-mash of Portuguese (sometimes Spanish) and Japanese names, which is most likely a nod to the fact that Brazil has the largest Japanese population in the world barring Japan.

She shares roughly the same skin color that Kate Alen has (who is black in the core games) in the series, but her hair color is a fairly pinkish shade of red.

The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndisclosedNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndisclosedNative">Nadia herself has no idea of her true heritage</a> is a major plot point.

</li><li> Claire Forrest from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden">Red Garden</a></em> is definitely one. Her race is really unclear, mostly because both she and her brother have darker skin tones, while her father doesn't. Also, her brother incidentally has blonde cornrows. Most fans assume that she is potentially bi-racial, as she's had that color since she was a child. To add to the debate, in a later episode Claire seems to get noticeably more upset and hesitant when she sees a picture of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the white man they have to kill standing next to his black wife</span> although the reason could have more to do with her parents' past relationship than their races.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, Onyankopon, a supporting character who appears later, appears to be a black, with a stereotypical big nose, thick lips and all. He's currently the only notable black character. His skin tone is distinctively exotic enough that Sasha has to ask why he's black, to which he replies that it was God who created humans in all shapes and forms. He comes from some unknown nation (perhaps akin to something in real-life Africa) that was subjugated by Marley, and thus shares some resentment with the ostracized Eldians that he's willing to turn against Marleyans and assist instead.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Tracey was designed to seem white and replace the more Asian-looking Brock.

Additionally, the reveal of contemporary relatives shows her younger brother being identical to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>. Girl's friend, Jill is even <em>more</em> ambiguous as she's got green eyes, apparently natural orange-caramel skin, matching straight hair, looks similar to Jaliera's French half-sister and while narrating her story, mentions the races of the men she's with without identifying herself with one or the other as well as an explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceFetish">Race Fetish</a> for Black men with the ones shown being darker <em>and</em> lighter than her.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> herself began as this. The intent was to show her as a 'woman of the world' and she was drawn with a mixture of African, white and Asian features.

</li><li> Wybie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> can come across as this. He's supposed to be black (or at least partly, it's not entirely clear) but the racial cues are harder to notice given the animation style.

Since he was going to marry the first black Disney princess it would either tell people Disney didn't believe in mixed race marriages or were cheating their fans out of a black prince. Henceforth he is a thoroughly ambiguous mish-mash from his name, the native words he uses, his skin, his hair, his eyes, etc. When we see his parents at the end of the movie they both have white hair from age, but that doesn't offer much in the way of clues either.

It has been debated whether she's meant to be black, or if she's a darker-skinned Asian. In the Japanese release, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">her skin is considerably lightened and she's altered to be a kimono-wearing Japanese girl</a>.

Further confused by his American South accent, Chinese name, and tactics similar to South American militants. This is in contrast to the Mandarin of the comics, who (as his name implies) is partly of Chinese descent. Perhaps surprisingly, the movie manages to make sense out of all this by the time it's over; basically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's merely an impersonator deliberately invoking a mishmash of various stereotypes about anti-American terrorists</span>.

Jimmy's full name is the very British-sounding "James Mattingly III" (his official credit on the rock album he and his band record), but Schaech made no attempt to lighten his skin tone for the role.

Pham Nuwen's red hair and slanted eyes engender much comment, as he's obviously a different race.
<ul><li> To the point where the protagonist actually accuses Pham Nuwen of being a created construct by the Old One rather than a real human being, since those two features are so rarely found together. The truth was a bit more complicated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He is a real person, but much of his body was destroyed in the deep-space accident from which he was later revived.

</li><li> Two of Louis's parents (his genetic father, Carlos Wu, and his mother, Sharrol Janss) and his sister Tanya had similar coloration. Beowulf Schaeffer, his adoptive father (and the father of Louis' stepsister Jeena) was an albino. Jeena Wu had the same skin color as Louis, but was naturally blue-eyed and blonde-haired.

This is explained somewhat by the fact the only places the Erdlings are able to gather food are places where the tree cover has been cleared away, exposing them to direct sunlight (and a tan) whereas the Kindar are almost always shaded by the leaves of their tree-cities. In fact, an Erdling child living among the Kindar quickly loses the tan; as one Kindar reports to another, "Even her skin seems to be a more normal shade now."

</li><li> The skin tones and facial features of Billy Slade, from Simon Hawke's <em>Wizard</em> novels, incorporate such an ambiguous blend of ethnic traits that he could well have a bit of <em>any</em> race in his ancestry.

The casting prompted Rowling herself to point out the above mentioned (that only brown eyes and frizzy hair were specified, not any race), showing support for the notion. Although race-bending casting is something that happens fairly often in the world of theatre.

In the series' Regency-era setting, most characters have a hard time determining what his race is beyond "not white", with many dismissive types settling on just calling him "Oriental" or "a Chinaman". Upon meeting him for the first time in Macau, the extremely white British protagonist initially thinks him some offshoot of Chinese, but decides against it, owing to Tharkay's un-Chinese clothing and lack of East Asian epicanthic folds.

In the later games, however, the Dictator is fought in different countries and has indeterminate facial features, including white monochromatic eyes.

What little can be seen appears to be dark in-game, and his ending implies that he might be David, the CIA agent in charge of investigating Q, who is very much dark-skinned.

<ul><li> In the games, Jade has had a brown skin tone but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a></em>, she was portrayed by a Russian woman.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>, it appears she's modeled after a black woman.

She could very well be mulatto (Black + White), cafuzo (Black + Indian), Caboclo (Indian + White), Jucara (Black + Indian + White), Ainoco (Japanese + White), among possibly many others.
<ul><li> Craig Marduk arguably counts as well. He's darker skinned than certainly white characters like the Williams sisters and is from Australia (which might suggest he has indigenous ancestry) but his skintone does vary depending on the game and/or artwork.
</li><li> There's also Jinpachi Mishima. He's Japanese, but his skin tone is noticeably darker than all of his descendants - in his debut appearance, it was almost as dark as Marduk's (his human form, that is; when you fight him as the final boss, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">more of a reddish-purple or fiery orange</a>, depending on which version of the game you're playing). He could be of mixed ancestry, as he's the only Mishima whose parents remain unidentified, or it could just be a tan. Presumably, Heihachi's mother was especially pale.

Melee</a></em> costume and in her trophy from the same game. Daisy is from a country with a desert, but it isn't exclusively desert. She went back to her original light tone starting with the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a></em> game (though, in turn, she received a slightly altered attire and a haircut).
</li><li> There is also a non-human example with Morton Koopa Jr. of the Koopalings, who has inexplicable brownish skin, unlike the yellowish skin that Bowser and the other Koopas have. Made even weirder by the fact that his head is of a literal white color.

However she lacks the Arab flavor Gerudos are usually associated with and is a blonde instead of a redhead. It's confirmed latter in the game that she's Hylian. She's the only character with Hylian ancestry in the game with dark skin like that, not even the other members of her crew or her own mother come close to match her tan. It might just be a tan...if she didn't seem to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get a lighter skin tone when she is revealed to be Zelda</span>, though the intent could have been to imply <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her natural tone is the one she has as Zelda and that she's tanned as Tetra.</span> Likewise, Sheik's skin tone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em> is somewhat tanned while Zelda is white, white, white. The answer may lie in some scrapped concept art for the game, as Tetra also had the distinct red eyes of a Sheikah, so her darker skin tone is probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to Sheik.
</li><li> Similarly Din the Oracle from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">Oracle</a></em> Games and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap">The Minish Cap</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedHead">Dark Skinned Red Head</a>. Because of her association with Din the Goddess, and by extension Ganondorf, you might assume she's Gerudo also but she lacks the longer nose, yellow eyes and round ears common to the race. Add to the fact that in <em>The Minish Cap</em> she's sisters with Nayru and Farore who both look like Hylians, as she does too despite her skin tone.
</li><li> Telma is obviously black however she bares a heavy resemblance to the Gerudo race. The problem is that Gerudo are apparently extinct by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>.

Combined with his enigmatic nature, this resulted in some early fan speculation that he was secretly an incarnation of Ganondorf. Gets weirder when it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's actually King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, the father of the pale Zelda.

<ul><li> K' from the NESTS Chronicles of KOF's early sprites have him with the same complexion as Heavy D! (who's Black American), but later depictions lighten his skin. Whip, a clone of K's biological sister is largely depicted as light skinned with the exception of her art for <em>KOF XI</em> (see <a class="urllink" href="http://snk.wikia.com/wiki/Whip?file=Whipxi.jpg">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>). To make this even more confusing, Krizalid (K's own clone) and Original Zero (not a clone, but still a high ranking member of NESTS) share K's skin and hair colors while Kyo's other clones are both darker skinned than the original. All considered, it's possible K's current looks are from the experiments he went through under NESTS custody and aren't what he really looks like.

She has light olive skin, wavy brown hair, a narrow nose, thin lips, and almond-shaped eyes that are light brown. Her race is never discussed at any point in the game, but it's prompted a lot of debate among fans. Judging by their picture, both her parents are black, though her mother Diana has light skin. Diana was originally going to be Clem's stepmother, but this was changed in the final game. Clementine's appearance is based on Derek Sakai's daughter, who is Asian. The developers have stated that Clem is definitely African-American, though they have not stated that this is all she necessarily is.

Like Barret in FFVII, Leo is the only dark-skinned character in the entire world, and his racial origins are not commented on (some of the concept art gives him exaggerated African features, almost to the point of caricature; but his in-game character portrait is ambiguous.)

She claimed she had Japanese ancestry but that was proven to be a lie by Master Miller. The truth is she's an orphan who has no idea who her parents are or what her original name might have been, only that she was adopted by mercenary, Frank Jaeger.
<div class="indent"><strong>Naomi Hunter:</strong> Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around. That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that...

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> we have Fenris and Dorian, who are both from Tevinter and both have medium skintones but otherwise no racial features definitively from one race. Complicated from the fact that Tevinter is a fantasy counterpart culture... based on the Roman Empire, which was ethnically diverse, and by that Fenris is shown to have family that's white as a sheet (although Fenris is an Elf so who knows). This causes a lot of contention in the fandom, to say the very least of it.

Fandom doesn't seem to know whether he's Latino, Native American, mixed race or just a tan white guy, and he could be any of these. Pretty odd given that most of the cast are either explicitly part of a given race and ethnicity or they are given very strong hints that unambiguously place them in a race and ethnicity.
</li><li> Reaper is another ambiguous character; while commonly believed to be Hispanic (his names is Gabriel Reyes, he has a common Hispanic skintone, he's from LA where that's half the racial population and he has Latin-American themed alternate skins) some fans believe his appearance looks more African-American or mixed race. In any case this only applies to the Blackwatch skin and flashbacks, since he now has bleached white skin and an unseen-but-horribly-altered face due to whatever transformation turned him into Reaper.
</li><li> Roadhog's real name is Mako (a Maori name meaning shark) and some hints support he might be a Maori from New Zealand, from one recolor skin called "kiwi", using idioms from NZ in one of his quotes and the lead writer Michael Chu suggesting Roadhog had a pet, it would have a kunekune pet (a domesticated pig from NZ). His islander skins, while not accurate to one Polynesian culture, might support this theory.

</div><ul><li> To add to the absurdity, the webcomic is in black and white.

</li></ul></li><li> The Hunter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Plume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Plume">Plume</a></em> has dark skin, green eyes and facial features just comic-book-y enough to obscure his ethnicity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PowerupComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PowerupComics">Powerup Comics</a></em> does this as part of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a>. Darkwinkle is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteComic">another character model recolored</a> with darker skin, and the author himself can't remember what race Darkwinkle's supposed to be. In one story arc, he's black, but in another strip, he takes offense at being called black, and insists that he's Mexican.
</li><li> Maree-Celee from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThePrincess99" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThePrincess99">The Princess 99</a></em> has dark red hair, red eyes, and brown skin but then it's later revealed that her father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Docteur Haypenny</span> has pale skin, red eyes, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkunkStripe">Skunk Stripe</a> hair to add to the confusion. Admittedly, Skye has dark skin and multicolored hair but this is made moot with the fact that she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">alien</a>. The entire novel tends to fall into this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">trope</a> when you consider that the setting is based of 1920s New Orleans but isn't set on Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent">Questionable Content</a></em> falls into this partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">the art style</a> makes everyone look white-ish and partly because its darker-skinned characters are generally no darker than the image that used to be up there. Some characters have non-Western <em>names</em>, like Amir, but they still look just sort of generically brown. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that one character, Dale, is African-American.
<ul><li> A later introduced character is Padma. Her appearance (dark skin, straight hair), combined with her name might strongly suggest an Indian descent.
</li><li> Someone asked the creator what race Tai was, to which he responded, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">Tan</a>." He later replied to another person asking what her nationality was with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">American.</a>" It's also said later in the story that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead">red hair</a> is actually dyed, implying that it's naturally dark brown or black, which still doesn't answer the question.
</li></ul></li><li> Tony from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RealLifeComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RealLifeComics">Real Life Comics</a></em> is a webcomic example, though a nigh-indistinguishable one. This at least has the reasoning that nobody knows what the real Tony is, either.
</li><li> In the colored comics for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Roommates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Roommates">Roommates</a></em>, Javert is noticeably more tan than the other roommates despite only being identified as French. His darker skin tone is almost certainly a nod to how Javert in the novel was the son of a gypsy woman and a convict, but the webcomic has Javert's mother be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morgan Le Fey</span>, who seems to be white. A spin-off comic has his father be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clopin</span> which would explain things, but it's uncertain exactly how canonical that is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SaturdayMorningBreakfastCereal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SaturdayMorningBreakfastCereal">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a></em> introduces new one-time characters for almost every strip, and these are a diverse bunch, not just straight white men by default. (At least starting in 2010 or so.) However, perhaps simply due to the art style, the non-white characters mostly look ambiguously brown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ScandinaviaAndTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ScandinaviaAndTheWorld">Scandinavia and the World</a></em>: <a class="urllink" href="http://satwcomic.com/reality-hits">America is getting darker<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> because the 2010 census indicated that whites will soon no longer be the majority of Americans. His hair is still blonde because he bleaches it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SpyingWithLana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SpyingWithLana">Spying with Lana</a></em>, Lana has a dark complexion, but her ethnicity is not explicitly stated.
</li><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TemplarArizona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TemplarArizona">Templar Arizona</a></em> characters are described by the comic's creator as "Templar brownish", that being the default ethnicity of characters whose race hasn't been pinned down specifically. Because, in her words, "It's dumb to care, if it's not going to be an element of the story."
</li><li> Petunia's entire family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ToddAllisonAndThePetuniaViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ToddAllisonAndThePetuniaViolet">Todd Allison &amp; the Petunia Violet</a></em> presently falls under this trope, as well as Meredith. Later chapters may change this, however. Considering the setting (early 20th-century Australia), they are presumably Aboriginal Australians.

Incidentally the face was based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IreneBedard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IreneBedard">voice actress</a>, who really is Native American... but her ancestry is from the opposite side of the continent.

<ul><li> This show has a particular problem with possibly Asian characters, in part due to its distinctively simple style. When a character is specifically supposed to be Asian, they're usually designed like a white person who's squinting. The head sixth-grader has this look, but his race has never been noted in-story.

Race-lifted Liz Allan is at least part Latina, though her exact background is somewhat complicated (to explain why she has a typically British last name despite her ethnicity and slight Puerto Rican accent). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Liz is half Puerto Rican (and half white?)

Blue eyes are not impossible but highly uncommon in real-world Arabic people. A picture of his father reveals that his father had brown skin and curly dark hair, while his blue eyes come from his mother who is lighter but still non-white. There has so far been no confirmation of his ethnicity, although saying something like &#145;Luke Skywalker is of European descent&#146; would make no sense considering there&#146;s no Europe in a galaxy far, far away. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ouij');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10ouij" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ouij');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Luke is half-Tatooinian and half-Naboo, making him obviously far removed from the original Coruscanti Human stock, but not enough to make him a "Near-Human" alien. </span> Word of Pablo Hidalgo is that all the human leads are multiracial by Earth standards, and supplementary material as well as the background characters reveal that Ezra's features are common among the humans of his home planet. So if anything, his ethnicity would be "Lothalian".
<ul><li> Sabine from the same series is also ethnically hard to pin down. Mandalorians are a bit more diverse and we've seen clearly white and black members, with the most famous being the Maori Jango Fett and his many clones. The reason this stands out is that in <em>The Clone Wars</em> the entire planet was lilly white and one of their leaders loudly claimed Jango wasn't ethnically Mandalorian at all. Her father is clearly East Asian though, and her voice actor (along with the voice actors of her mother and brother) are of Indian descent.
</li><li> Kanan, Ezra's mentor, has the darkest skin of the crew but doesn't have a family or even a planet to pin down. The creators have confirmed he was designed without a specific race in mind (although some fans see him as Latino like his voice actor).

He was supposed to look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellySavalas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellySavalas">Telly Savalas</a>, a Greek-American actor. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, he is given a lighter skin tone to rectify the confusion, which led some viewers to think he'd been given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Race Lift</a>.
</li><li> Whyatt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperWhy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperWhy">Super Why!</a></em> has olive skin, and it's unclear if he is Caucasian or Latino. It's possible he's biracial, since his mother has fair skin and his father has olive skin.
</li><li> Princess Ariel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThundarrTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThundarrTheBarbarian">Thundarr the Barbarian</a>.</em> Justified, since you'd expect there to be different ethnicities 3000 years in the future.
</li><li> Quite a few characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has cleared up some of the confusion: Courtney is Hispanic, Noah is Indian, Justin is native Hawaiian, and Katie is white (with a tan). Sierra remains unidentified, although it's been stated that she has German family members.
<ul><li> Mostly averted with the TDRI cast, where the ethnicities of the various minority characters are pretty obvious&mdash;with the exception of Mike (who is stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to be Italian) and Anne Maria (who is probably also Italian based on her being a <em>Jersey Shore</em> parody).
</li><li> In the TDPI cast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Dave</a> (who is Indian according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>). Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionateSportsGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassionateSportsGirl">Sky</a>, whom many think is Asian but is said by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to be Native American (which is hinted in the show as she is able to speak Cree and her audition tape has a dreamcatcher in the background). Some fans also think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadWannabe">Max</a> looks Asian and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Shawn</a> may be Hispanic, though these are less obvious examples and have never been confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
</li><li> Then there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em> contestants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsianAirhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsianAirhead">Devin</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoolishSiblingResponsibleSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoolishSiblingResponsibleSibling">sisters</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak">Emma</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraFiend">Kitty</a>, all of whom appear to be East Asian, but it's never specified what kind. There's also Brody, Ellody, Jen, and Lorenzo, who are all dark-skinned but never have their ethnicity stated in the show (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says Brody is Hispanic, Ellody is Indian, and Lorenzo is Italian; Jen is merely tanned).
</li></ul></li><li> Alex from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em>. Her dad is white (shown in season 4) and her mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">looks exactly like her</a> but darker. Her dad gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">complete makeover</a> and becomes brown in season 6.
</li><li> Sari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead">Dark-Skinned Redhead</a> although her adopted father Isaac Sumdac is obviously Indian, complete with accent. This may or may not have been intentional, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's revealed that Sari is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">human/Cybertronian hybrid</a> from a protoform absorbing Issac's DNA</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">The German dub gives Isaac a Chinese accent</a>. Make of that what you will.
</li><li> Sam Alexander/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nova">Nova</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> is shown to be lighter than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhiteTiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhiteTiger">Ava</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire">Luke</a>, but darker than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist">Danny</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Peter</a>. The comics establish that he's mixed race, with a white father and a Mexican mother.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em> has Allura, Hunk, and Lance as varying shades of brown. This is a departure from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">the original source,</a> which depicted the entire team as white.
<ul><li> Hunk and Lance were eventually confirmed to be Samoan/African American and Cuban, respectively, removing the ambiguity for them. Meanwhile, Allura is of an alien species, so the ambiguity was likely intentional for her.
</li><li> As seen in a flashback episode of season 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Honerva, prior to becoming Haggar, though she regains her true form in season 6.</span>
</li><li> Adam, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shiro's ex-boyfriend</span>, and Curtis also fit this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nabu looks like he could be black, white with a tan, or Hispanic. Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em>, this may have been done to avoid controversy since he was engaged to Princess Aisha, the token dark-skinned fairy. Judging by his parents, many fans think he was meant to be Indian-coded.
</li><li> Flora is this to fans as well. There were constant debates as to whether she was a fair skinned black girl or a tanned white girl. She's apparently supposed to be Latina, going by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that she was modelled after Jennifer Lopez.
</li><li> Despite being a pale blonde, even Stella could get this, as she seems to be coded as a white Latina. Not only does her Season 1 outfits (such as her princess outfit) and concept art invoke Mesoamerican influence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms she was inspired by Cameron Diaz, who is also Hispanic.
</li><li> Princess Galatea is an interesting case. Not only is she a light-skinned blonde, her name literally means "white as milk" and she was even given an Irish accent in the Cinelume dub. That said, she is from Musa's homeland, which is normally painted as Asian-inspired. During the Nick run, her father was introduced as being much more Asiatic in appearance, complete with a kimono, suggesting she is Eurasian coded. By Season 8, however, she practically turns into a clone of Stella.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> :
<ul><li> Word Girl gets double points for being a generically-brown girl adopted by a different-color-of generically-brown (a redder shade) family, nothing about whom seems ethnic in any specific way (last name being Botsford), and possibly another half-point for actually being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Alien</a> foundling.
</li><li> Minor villain Miss Question is this as well, though her curly hair implies she might be black.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XavierRiddleAndTheSecretMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XavierRiddleAndTheSecretMuseum">Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum</a></em>: Xavier and Yadina have tan skin, but their ethnicity is unknown. However, "I Am Tomioka Tessai" implies that they may be Hispanic.
</li><li> X-23 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> is ambiguously brown despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">clone</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, who is white. It's explained that the Wolverine DNA sample was incomplete, so the female scientist that made her used some of her own DNA as well. Since she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">moved to the comics</a> she's generally depicted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RavenHairIvorySkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RavenHairIvorySkin">Raven Hair, Ivory Skin</a>, though she occasionally appears darker, such as during her stint as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainUniverse">Captain Universe</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Logan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Logan">Logan</a></em> she is depicted as Mexican but played by a Spanish actress.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder21" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There's still a good deal of debate as to <a class="urllink" href="https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2020/04/23/were-the-ancient-egyptians-black/">what the ancient Egyptians looked like<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The general consensus, backed by 2017 genetic tests, is that they looked very similar (though perhaps <em>slightly</em> lighter skinned) to modern Egyptians and probably most similar to peninsular Gulf Arabs, as the waves of immigrants which moved to the area from all over the Middle East and North Africa were not big enough to seriously change the gene pool.
<ul><li> A famously reproduced painting from the Egyptian "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates">Book of Gates<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" shows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">four peoples of the world</a>: Libyan, Nubian, Asian, and Egyptian. The Libyan and Asian are white, the Nubian is black, and the Egyptian is... brown. Or even dark red. It doesn't help that the Egyptians used the words "red skinned" to mean vitality and vigor, and painted themselves accordingly.
</li></ul></li><li> Contemporary descriptions of complexion can often be ambiguous or misleading to a modern reader. See, for example, the numerous references to "black" men and women in the Diary of Samuel Pepys, circa 1660. Cross-referencing to paintings of some of them, it's clear he was referring to white anglos we'd call "dark brown" or "black-haired" in today's language.
<ul><li> This is certainly true because the term "black" back then simply means someone who has very dark complexion or hair, not "black" as in referring to a particular race as we know of today (in fact, that conception of race is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">new</a>). It is evident when Ancient Greeks called people from Egyptians and Victorian British to the Indians "black".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11kbod');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11kbod" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11kbod');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ancient Greeks hadn't developed words for many colors, which is why ancient texts describe blood as being "green", meaning that the blood was bright and fresh.</span> So this further complicates whenever a particular historical figure was mentioned to be "black". It's unknown if that referred to their tan/dark skin, hair, or if they had a black African origin.
</li></ul></li><li> American CIA agent Tony Mendez (subject of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Argo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Argo">Argo</a></em>), who was of Spanish/Italian/French descent, commented on this phenomenon once. He noted that someone with his look (dark hair, dark eyes, below average 5'7 stature, Mediterranean facial features, and skin that's fair by default but quickly turns olive given even moderate exposure to the sun) can blend in as a local pretty much anywhere in the world outside of Sub-Saharan Africa and East/Southeast Asia. Including the Americas, most of Europe, the Middle East, and even India. This came in handy during his spy work.
</li><li> As the world becomes more global and mixed, knowing people who are "ambiguously brown" is only going to become more common. Anyone who is darker than olive tone is often assumed to be Mexican even though they can literally be from anywhere in Central and South America, Oceania, Asia and the Middle East. People who are mixed race can live on any continent.
</li><li> Republican senate for Alabama Roy Moore's lawyer said of Ali Velshi, regarding [his ethnicity]<a class="urllink" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/roy-moores-lawyer-to-ali-velshi-your-background-should-help-you-understand-underage-dating">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &#147;In other countries, there&#146;s arrangement through parents for what we would refer to as consensual marriage.&#148; The co-host reminded him that Velshi is Canadian.
</li><li> A respected economist was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForTerrorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForTerrorist">Mistaken for Terrorist</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ivy-league-professor-doing-math-equation-flight-mistaken-terrorist-n569911">on a flight<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> because someone thought an equation he was writing looked like a secret code, because of his vaguely 'foreign' appearance (olive skin, dark eyes, dark curly hair and beard, large slightly curved nose). The economist in question was Italian, from Turin, Piedmont, northern Italy.
