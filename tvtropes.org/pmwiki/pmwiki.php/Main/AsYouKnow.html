</p><p>This is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition">exposition</a> where one character explains to another something that they both know, but the audience doesn't or may have forgotten.
</p><p></p><div class="indent"><em>"As you know, Alice, my Death Ray depends on codfish balls."</em>
<p></p></div><div class="indent"><em>"Damn it, Bob, you know full well that Alice hasn't been the same since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">that tragic codfish incident</a>."</em>
</div><p>In discussions of science fiction, this is often "As You Know, Bob" (abbreviated AYKB), or occasionally, "Tell me, Professor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpoSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpoSpeak">[about this marvelous invention we all use every day and have no reason to be talking about except to inform the audience]"</a>. Other common variations involve a newspaper reporter sent to cover events, or a conversation between two supporting characters &#151; hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">another name</a>, "maid and butler dialogue". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> refers to the fantasy fiction version as the "As you know, your father, the king..." speech.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is also a common feature of pilot episodes, where characters' backgrounds and relationships need to be established for the first time. Likewise, when new characters are introduced or the writers believe a reminder is in order, characters will explicitly refer to each other by name during a regular conversation, when this is rarely done in real life: "Say, Alice, how are you enjoying your coffee?" "Why, it's delicious, Bob, thanks for asking. How are you coming along, Charlie?"
</p><p>This is also quite common on medical drama shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>, where common medical phenomena and simple procedures must be explained to the laymen in the audience. In most cases, this is achieved by explaining the disease or procedure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">an intern or non-professional character</a>.
</p><p>On some shows, characters will "As You Know" in order to provide information that was already provided in a previous episode (that viewers might have missed) or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">earlier in the show</a> (for those who just tuned in), to the great annoyance of dedicated fans. (e.g. Just Tuned In: "Remember, Bob, you only have 20 minutes to defuse the bomb..." or Previous Episode: "Alice is really mad at you for running over her dog last week, isn't she?") Soap operas or adventure-type shows will often circumvent this with a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">When we last left our heroes</a>" recap at the beginning of each two-parter.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This may also happen with solitary characters (in thought rather than in speech), who, apparently, have such bad memory problems that they have to constantly remind themselves what they're doing right now and what happened in the near past.
</p><p>Not explaining anything sometimes results in the audience being too busy trying to figure out what's going on to enjoy the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">using this trope is not always a bad thing</a>. In serialized works or plays, "as you know" is seen as a convenient workaround to save time or to spare readers returning to the series. For example, it's easier to say "as you know, Dr. Moriarty is the most feared criminal mastermind in the world" than showing to new readers to the Sherlock Holmes series just what kind of criminal the doctor is. Or, it often would be more advantageous to a play's length to say "as you know, the Montagues and Capulets have been feuding for 50 years" than to show a fifty-year-long feud. Notwithstanding, there are less obvious workarounds in use in modern writing.
</p><p>Writers try to avoid this by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>, and thus the most common alternative is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">give the protagonist amnesia</a> so he <em>doesn't</em> know, which isn't really considered a better option. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> are also acceptable tropes to employ to make this trope more believable, though shoehorning in such a character may be worse. A third form is to have two characters comparing information to each be sure that the other does in fact know. A fourth is to have the characters have an argument, since arguments are among the few real-life situations in which people remind each other of things they both already know.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ahhb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ahhb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ahhb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"How could you do X? You know perfectly well that Y..."</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> to have the characters know they are informing the audience is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> in its own right, but obviously suitable only for broadly comic works.
</p><p>It was ridiculously common in post-World War II literature, to the point that readers expected it and could become confused if the writer left it out. This might be the most universal trope found in postwar literature; you find it in works by everyone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a> to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraCartland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraCartland">Barbara Cartland</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RexStout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RexStout">Rex Stout</a>. (One wonders which one of the three would be most insulted by that grouping.)
</p><p>Generally more acceptable when dealing with characters who are in situations where exposition is actually going on in-universe, e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionBriefing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionBriefing">military briefings</a> or scientific lectures. In these cases, the phrase is less used to explain something and more to bring focus to a particular fact. ("As you know, we lost contact with Delta Squad this morning..." or "As you may know, the proton has a mass of...")

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Watsonian</a> reason is that she wants to emphasize that she already knows everything about him and that he'll only drag out the inevitable by refusing to confess to his "crimes", but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Doylist</a> reason is to get viewers who haven't seen the Golden Age adaptations caught up on the backstory.
</li><li> '80s anime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a></em> employed this trope regularly. This was mostly because, unlike many other '80s cartoons, it featured an on-going storyline that frequently built upon events from previous episodes. Children couldn't be expected to watch a show that patiently, so cue many long conversations with characters telling each other "Yes, you may remember the golden condor we discovered underneath the Inca ruins," etc., etc. This trope is only present in the English version, however; in the original French (the show is a France/Japan co-production and the writing team was French) characters never use this trope. At best it's them applying what they previously learned to new situations (if X was solar powered, then Y must also be!).
</li><li> The anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade">Witchblade</a></em> tends to occasionally fall back on this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Team Aqua and Team Magma</a> meet for the first time onscreen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a> Advanced</em>, and not only speak in an As You Know, but also make an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Introdump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Introdump">Introdump</a> at the start of that dialog.
</li><li> Early chapters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> manga have Lucia constantly being reminded she's a princess, a mermaid, forbidden to date humans, can't go into water in public, and various things she already knows. Then again, she's always been a bit headstrong about these limitations anyway. The anime got rid of this by tacking on a prologue on every episode explaining the whole situation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hit hard by <em>Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone</em>, during the scene in which Ritsuko explains the specifics of Operation Yashima to Misato, the <em>person who came up with the plan in the first place</em>. The dub tries to fix this by turning it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetMeGetThisStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetMeGetThisStraight">Let Me Get This Straight...</a>. It helps... a bit.
</li><li> Mari in 2.22 frequently gives exposition... <em>to herself</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 112 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Urahara and Isshin Kurosaki have an extended conversation telling each other things they both already know about the two new sets of bad guys on the plot horizon, for the benefit of both the audience and some other characters standing off to the side. What is most inexplicable is that they don't just tell the other characters instead of talking to each other, which would have made the scene make sense!
</li><li> Used rather neatly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> with the explanation that the main character is an idiot who never paid attention in school. Things frequently have to be explained to him several times in gradually simpler terms. This is usually done during training segments, so it has a natural feel to it. Sasuke, on the other hand, is improbably ignorant given his backstory. Plenty of other characters among the rookies are clueless about things they absolutely should know as well, especially the members of team "InoShikaCho," whose fathers have been grooming them as heirs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiddyGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiddyGrade">Kiddy Grade</a></em> uses this trope right off the bat in the first episode to set up the show's premise.
</li><li> In Episode 14 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikerS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikerS">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Striker S</a></em>, Fate quizzes her adopted children Erio and Caro on history as a way of providing the viewer with exposition on the origins of the TSAB.
</li><li> In the first chapter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>, Sakura and Shaolan tell each other how they first met and for how long they've been friends, obviously to fill in the reader on their backstory. In this case, they are simply revelling in memories.
</li><li> This way of recapping is constantly and irritatingly used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> manga. A commander telling his fellow warriors about the great battle in which they all participated...
</li><li> There's a strange example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>. After the first arc, Touma <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has had his memory erased</span>, so whenever someone like Stiyl starts talking about something that happened then, Touma is more or less completely in the dark, even though it's something he <em>should</em> know. It'd be a fine example of As You Know if he actually <em>did</em> know.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> franchise, every time an effect is activated, the player has to explain exactly what it does &mdash; sometimes more than once for the same card in the same duel in the same episode. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Either this is because most players do this in real life, or it caused most players to do this in real life</a>. The Chicken or the Egg? Strictly speaking, this is actually a rule of the game. Made no less funny when Kaiba lampshaded it as unnecessary in The Movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">then explained it anyway</a>.
<ul><li> In the third episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">second anime</a>, Yugi and Jonouchi revel in memories of how they became friends. Since the anime skipped almost everything of the first <em>seven</em> volumes, it is the only way to explain what happened in chapter 1.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> S</em>, the Professor retells his plan to Kaolinite for the audience's benefit, even though she, as his second-in-command, should already know it in the first episode and definitely knows by the second.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a>:</em> The main objective of the protagonists (collect 99 evil souls and then a witch's to make your weapon into a Deathscythe) is revealed to us in this manner by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death himself</a> in the first episode... except, the main characters had already exposited about it as they got the 99th soul, earlier in the episode. Death even goes as far as actually saying the words "As you know" in his explanation. It's very odd since the earlier scene would have precluded the need for this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IGPXImmortalGrandPrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IGPXImmortalGrandPrix">IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix</a></em> does this at the end of episode one. As Team Satomi prepares to race Team Sledgemamma in the first race of the IGPX-1, equivalent to the major league, the announcer Benjamin Bright explains the rules of IGPX to thousands of fans, and the racers. In the English dub, he actually says, "Let's recap the rules of the IGPX for those two or three of you who don't know."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco">Space Patrol Luluco</a></em>: At the start of episode 1, Luluco manages to remind Keiji of everything he already knows but the audience doesn't, in response to him praising her for turning out so normal growing up in an abnormal environment:
<div class="indent"><strong>Luluco:</strong> You're part of the Space Patrol that upholds Ogikubo's law and order, and hardly get any time off.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Lucy meets Natsu and Happy for the first time, she goes into detail explaining to them what guilds are and that she wants to join the most popular guild around (the eponymous Fairy Tail guild), and then laughs it all off as something the two wouldn't be interested in. She doesn't realize until later that the two are <em>from</em> the guild she's trying to join. Granted, Lucy doesn't refer to Fairy Tail by name in her description, and Natsu and Happy really don't seem very interested in what she has to say, but considering how <em>everyone</em> in the series seems to know what guilds are (in fact, there probably isn't a character in the series who <em>hasn't</em> heard of Fairy Tail) it's all the more obvious that she's explaining it to the audience. This comes off a touch better in retrospect once Lucy's educated but sheltered backstory is known, as at the time she probably <em>wouldn't</em> know just what the average citizen knows and has reason to expect there are a lot of topics she'd know more about (this just isn't one of them). And while the city they're in does get wizard traffic, the plot implies it's well off the beaten path for guild members.
</li><li> Master Hades has one later on, explaining the nature of the wizards in his guild &mdash; to nobody but himself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Invoked during Impel Down when Bon Clay, in the disguise of the vice-warden Hannyabal, wants to know more about the phenomenon "demoning away" that has apparently taken away his great hero Ivankov. He asks a jailer to explain it, and when the jailer confusedly says that Bon Clay already knows, Bon Clay asks him to tell it again since it is "such a great story". Fortunately, the real Hannyabal is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">weird like that</a>, so the jailer doesn't get suspicious.
</li><li> Lampshaded and Played for Laughs. As Rayleigh limited Luffy's access to the outside world during his two years of training, Luffy, and, by extension, us, missed out on several major events in <em>One Piece</em> universe. Notable events are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fall of every island in Whitebeard's territory, the battle between Akainu and Aokiji, Aokiji's resignation and Akainu's promotion to Fleet Admiral, the rise of Luffy and the Supernovas' bounties, Sengoku and Garp's resignation, Law and Buggy as the new Warlords of the Sea, the new danger to the Devil Fruit users, Blackbeard's usurping of Whitebeard's Four Emperors seat, his crew's rise to power, the moves of the Revolutionaries, and most notably <em>how exactly</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Blackbeard usurped the above mentioned seat</a></span>. But, these above events changed the power of the world so much, that these are household talks. Quoth Usopp:
<div class="indent"><strong>Usopp:</strong> <em>[to Luffy]</em> This was huge news!! Where were you eh, hiding under a rock???
</div></li><li> And happens once again during the <em>Wano Country Arc</em> while during the Act 2 Interlude, <strong>major plot points and the Yonko's as well as Gol D. Roger's bounties</strong> were casually revealed by Sengoku in a history lesson to the Marines.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicTheHedgehogTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicTheHedgehogTheMovie">Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie</a></em>, Robotnik begins his exposition by stating that the world the story takes place in is split in two- the outer half called the Land of the Sky, and the inner half called the Land of Darkness. At the Land of the Sky part, Sonic says, "Tell us something we DON'T know." and Robotnik snarls, "Shut up! Heed me!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em>, the villains Scanty and Kneesocks often explain their plans to each other, saying they both already know but like to hear themselves talk.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> reveals her backstory by explaining it to literally the only other person in the world who already knows. You'd think it would have been easy to avoid that.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, where veteran MMORPG players feel a need to explain things among themselves from the major gameplay elements to the very basic ones such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">"use potions to heal HP."</a> Granted, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> sometimes if they're talking to newbie players who are still getting a handle on the mechanics (and the fact said mechanics are now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMostDangerousVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMostDangerousVideoGame">literally life and death</a> means an occasional refresher isn't too out there), but it doesn't help when they're doing it between each other.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyriadColorsPhantomWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyriadColorsPhantomWorld">Myriad Colors Phantom World</a></em> when Haruhiko describes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Phantoms</a> to Izumi, noting, "It's common knowledge, but I'll explain anyway."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Mostly averted since the 104th Trainee Corps would logically have explained things to them for the first time during training and at the start of service in their branch. At one point, though, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> yells at Connie for screwing up the salute ("I've already explained to you that the salute represents..."). Going by what it represents (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeSalute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangeSalute">Strange Salute</a>), he likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">thought his heart was on the right side of his chest</a>.
</li><li> In the first episode of the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SenkiZesshouSymphogear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SenkiZesshouSymphogear">Senki Zesshou Symphogear</a></em>, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies">Bridge Bunnies</a> is seen explaining to his co-worker everything that happened to the organization they work for in the 3 months <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> after the episode's opening scene.
</li><li> An amusing example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">&forall; Gundam</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaseClosed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaseClosed">Case Closed</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series has frequent recaps in the manga due to the chapter format and original magazine publication. While it's both an established convention for mysteries and believable for a detective at <em>some</em> point to sketch out the case, suspects and evidence, at times this ends up happening multiple times to an identical audience in a remarkably short period of in-universe time. And as in this series the detective doing the recap is rarely a major factor in the investigation s/he may not even know about developments in the case and have anything new to say, or be audibly working anything out.
</li><li> Men in Black at times do the same thing (explain their plans and situational knowledge to each other) when they show up, usually about things they've long since communicated with each other previously and more securely. While going over the plan isn't unreasonable, especially as "the plan" often involves somebody being killed, at times this also gets suspiciously repetitive. Sometimes even those ends up as plausible, because their <em>modus operandi</em> includes constantly testing to see if somebody's aware of their existence or the details of their discussions.
</li></ul></li><li> The recap at the start of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> anime's second season is framed as a letter to one of All Might's mentors, Gran Torino, but includes details about the mechanics of All Might's quirk, One For All, that are both closely guarded secrets and information Gran Torino is already well aware of.
<ul><li> The season three opener as well, with a scene where two of the adults summarize the powers of every kid in Class 1-A.
</li><li> The beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Sports Festival Arc</a> also has Aizawa telling the class how the festival is a nationally-televised event more popular than the Olympics, which you'd think that they would already know.
</li><li> In the aftermath of Midoriya, Todoroki and Iida's fight with Stain, the police chief tells the three about the law against unauthorized uses of Quirks to fight crime, pointing out that they <em>should</em> already know this &mdash; all so he can emphasize his displeasure that they used their Quirks to fight a villain anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Amusingly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaroleAndTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaroleAndTuesday">Carole &amp; Tuesday</a></em>. Tao tells Angela that 99% of the world's pop music is now generated by AIs, then remarks that she probably already knew that. Angela replies that she actually had no idea.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl">Daily Life with Monster Girl</a></em>. Miss Smith drops by in the first chapter to make sure that Kimihito knows the rules for the Interspecies Exchange Act and is following them because he's only been a host for Miia for a couple of days. And because she couldn't remember if she'd actually told them to him first.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji">Muhyo and Roji</a></em>, during a flashback, Rio goes to Executor Elena to beg for the latter's help in saving Rio's mother from a ghost. In the anime, Rio apparently feels the need to remind Elena, an elite magical law practitioner, that artificers like Rio don't have the power to defeat spirits. To make matters worse, the fact that Rio can't use magical tools had already been explained to the viewer and become relevant in the previous episode, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverBlowingSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverBlowingSuperpower">using a magical tool to save Biko</a> revealed that Rio was a forbidden magical law user(the flashback showed why Rio turned to forbidden magical law and joined Enchu)</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em>, after Yuu's little sister Ayumi mentions having feeling that there used to be an additional member of the family- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who turns out to be their older brother</span>- Yuu reminds her that they've been living on their own since their mother abandoned them, with their uncle supporting them but not living with them.

<ul><li> Lampshaded (via emphasis) and subverted: Beast begins an As You Know introduction of Hansel to Prince Charming, but Charming protests he really has no idea who Hansel is.
</li><li> Since <em>Fables</em> primarily focuses on a small community, the members of whom have lived together for centuries, early issues in particular are prone to this trope, as the author tries to catch the reader up without benefit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Na&iuml;ve Newcomer</a>. This gets lampshaded in the very first issue; Bigby Wolf is talking to Snow White about Rose Red, and refers to her as "your sister, Rose Red" and Snow promptly tells him that she <em>does</em> in fact know who her sister is.

This is for the reader's sake, as Marcel is quick to point out he was there when it happened.
</li><li> Done endlessly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> comic books, particularly those involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>. Sometimes the villains would explain their plan to each other after they had carried it out. As often as not, Superman would overhear this conversation and swoop down to capture them, having had no clue prior to this what had been going on.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> largely avoids this, but some examples still stands out:
<ul><li> One is the story of Madcoil told around a campfire, which allows the main character's love interest to find out about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> (through eavesdropping). It's told because of tradition, and because the children present haven't heard it yet.
</li><li> A <em>far</em> more jarring example is found in the <em>Discovery</em> books (written by the same original author, but a good three decades later) in which the characters... well, talk like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.elfquest.com/gallery/OnlineComics/DISC/DisplayDISC.html?page=14">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Another jarring example occurs in the first issue of <em>Siege at Blue Mountain</em>, the second print series which began after a 2-year hiatus. In lieu of a synopsis, the Wolfriders explain the whys and wherefores of the story so far to each other, ostensibly as part of their decision-making process. Later series got a lot better at integrating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> into the dialogue.
</li></ul></li><li> In an early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> Season 8 comic, Willow is visiting Buffy and Xander, and asks about their love life. Xander replies jokingly that all women desire him, a statement which Willow appears to take seriously, as she gratuitously adds that she herself had once been attracted to him. Given that the only people in the room were both there at the time of Willow's infatuation (in Seasons 1-3), the only reason for this line to be included was to remind the audience that Willow wasn't always a lesbian.

In the next panel they're standing in front of a bunch of weird buildings:

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">first film</a> has to drop a lot of "As You Know" exposition on the audience, where characters discuss past events that we the audience will soon witness when Marty travels back in time. For example, Lorraine tells the story of how she and George met, which elicits a groan from daughter Linda: "You've told this story a thousand times." Once Marty travels to 1955, he finds himself embroiled in the events his mother is narrating.

If the audience already knows who the musician is, he just introduces them by name, if they don't (i.e., the musician is from after 1991), he explains what they did, which is somewhat jarring. It's then played with:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rufus:</strong> And a special treat from the 23rd century, Miss Ria Paschelle.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em> has an awkward early scene where Captain Bryant gives entry-level exposition about replicants to Rick Deckard, an experienced hunter of replicants. It's an odd exception to the rule, for most of the rest of the film does an excellent job of showing or implying rather than telling outright; for instance, the prohibitive cost of owning real live pets is alluded to repeatedly, but it's left to the viewer to figure out that real animals (besides pigeons, evidently) are scarce in this super-urbanized world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This could be an oblique reference towards the fact, in some versions, that Deckard is a replicant himself and may have no further knowledge above them.

</li><li> Done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles">Blazing Saddles</a></em> just to set up a joke. Everyone in the town is gathered in the church to discuss what to do about the bandits ransacking the town - and the preacher begins by letting everyone know that bandits are ransacking the town. He even begins his speech by saying that he doesn't have to tell them any of this: sheriff murdered, crops burned, stores looted, women stampeded, and cattle raped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CabinFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CabinFever">Cabin Fever</a></em>: There's a deadly disease going around and at one point, only two healthy people are left in the cabin - everyone else having fled or being at death's door. For reasons that are hard to fathom, and difficult to write convincing dialogue for, the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoitusEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoitusEnsues">impulsively have sex.</a> Mid-way through this (i.e. <strong>after</strong> penetration has occurred) the man asks the woman with surprise if she doesn't use condoms. Both parties involved would clearly be aware that they aren't using one. But the filmmakers need to be clear about it because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out the woman already (unknowingly) has the disease and as it's quite explicit that the sex was <em>unsafe</em>, we realize that she has sexually passed the disease to the man</span>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Paul:</strong> Don't you use condoms? <br><strong>Marcy:</strong> It's okay. I'm healthy.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>, Daggett explains the function of the Clean Slate Drive to Selina even though she obviously knows what it does. Mitigated in that, not only does Daggett explain its abilities in a sarcastic tone of voice, he adds, "Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it?", implying he had been lying about it all along and is now mocking Selina for having been stupid enough to believe such a thing could exist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Disraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Disraeli">Disraeli</a></em> is an early talking film from 1929. In the silent movie days filmmakers could just insert a title card to explain who a character was, but that easy shortcut went away with the transition to sound. So instead we get awkward exposition, like when someone asks Lord Probert "What does the director of the Bank of England say?", only for Lord Probert to answer "I say..." in order to let the audience know who he is.
</li><li> Flawless example in the movie <em>Dragonfly</em>: a speaker at a funeral says of the deceased, "From her colleagues at the university to her young patients here in Chicago Memorial's pediatric oncology ward, she will be sorely missed" &mdash; <em>speaking to</em> the deceased's family, her colleagues from the university and her associates from the pediatric oncology ward, none of whom needed to be informed what city they were in, what hospital she was associated with, or what field of medicine she specialized in.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGame">The Game</a></em>, a secretary reminds Van Orton that he is trying to be reached by a certain Elizabeth.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em>, when the Janjira reactor collapses and starts venting radioactive gas into the structure, Joe feels the need to remind his wife (and, by extension, the audience), that she has to hurry out of there, otherwise she "won't last five minutes, with or without the suits". Never mind that she's one of the (if not <em>the</em>) lead technicians at the plant and is probably more aware of the risks than he is.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>, the adaptation to film removes Katniss' first-person perspective and thus in-universe explanations. The film gets around this by featuring scenes with announcers explaining certain aspects of the games to new viewers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified in that</a> every year, there will naturally be new viewers <em>somewhere</em> in Panem, the arena is different each year, and not everyone will be able to tell on sight that (for example) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the stinging insects are tracker jackers, not just bees or wasps</span>.

<ul><li> Justified in that Saruman is behaving in a way that only someone who Doesn't Know would feel safe in behaving, and has asked a question that only someone who Doesn't Know would need to ask. Gandalf's As You Know is the most polite way he has to say "Because Sauron might be watching us right now, you idiot." If it had been anyone else, Gandalf would have just said <em>that</em>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Saruman:</strong> Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf: a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
</div></li><li> There's even a point at which Saruman solemnly tells Gandalf, who's leading the Fellowship toward the mines of Moria, that "you know" what evil lurks beneath them (the Balrog) &mdash; except Saruman is in his tower, hundreds of miles away, talking to himself, so it's really more of an "As I Know":

Heinlein</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MethuselahsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MethuselahsChildren">Methuselah's Children</a></em> opens with a meeting of Howard Foundation members where one character goes on for several pages, detailing the history of the foundation, its goals, and his plans for the future. While very interesting (to the reader), the entire monologue is framed as an As You Know. As the characters are all extremely long-lived and therefore very patient, they don't mind too much. He is however called on it by Lazarus Long, who has better things to do - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">mostly involving sex</a>.

It's used toward the reader as an excuse to skip exposition. Specifically, Rico's narration skips over a lot about the powered armor by telling the reader "But if you really are interested in the prints and stereos and schematics of a suit's physiology, you can find most of it, the unclassified part, in any fairly large public library." On the other hand in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a> their sergeant goes over the plan of attack even though it's been hypnotically implanted in the troopers, as "some of you don't have minds to hypnotise."

For example, when Ernie asks where Sam's coworker's party is, Sam responds, "Brandenburg Township, as I said."
</li><li> Novelist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> has a tendency to fall into this trap in his multi-volume alternative history epics (such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worldwar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worldwar">Worldwar</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191">Timeline-191</a></em> series); he will often recap complicated alternative histories and the plots of two, three or more previous novels in the series by having characters engage in conversations or think to themselves about things that they would already know.
</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>, the title character receives a letter from his adopted sister which tells him his own life story in nauseating detail. The phrase "You will recall..." pops up a few times. Likewise there's one that begins along the lines of, "I'm sure you remember our young maid, Justine, but in case you don't..."
</li><li> James Hogan rather neatly avoids this trope while still managing to do huge Infodumps in his <em>Ganymede</em> series, by managing things so that there's always someone present who justifiably needs the infodump, whether it's a biologist getting briefed on extremely advanced physics, a physicist being brought up to speed on political matters, or a businessman being briefed on the fine points of biochemistry. It helps that Hogan's got a huge multi-disciplinary team to work with, and better, the main character is a man whose biggest talent is his ability to cross-correlate information from many areas without being a specialist in any of them himself. This means he often specifically <em>requests</em> an infodump from a specialist.
</li><li> In early 20th century dystopian sci-fi, Yevgeny Zamyatin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/We" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/We">We</a></em> averts this: the novel, written as a journal, is addressed to an alien readership; therefore, it's natural that the narrator explains some of the most basic facts of his everyday world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em>, Orwell uses the very clever trick of getting the basic facts explained to us by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDocument" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDocument">secret book</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the Brotherhood</a>, which works as a subversive primer to the indoctrinated population.

Of special mention are the specifics of the war they have just been fighting, the introduction of the villain's name, which has a vague justification, and telling Dumbledore he's noble, just to establish him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">good guy</a> in the books. Also, they refer to each other by last names, while they are on first-name terms in later books and have known each other for decades. The scene with Dumbledore and McGonagall is mostly gratuitous, in that most relevant details in that scene are also covered later, being told to Harry directly; and it refers to a lot of things that aren't apparent until later books, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">like Sirius Black.</a>
</li><li> This also shows up in a peculiar form (you might call it an inversion) partway through <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>, when Hermione is telling Ron and Harry about the Philosopher's Stone, which can be used to achieve immortality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParrotExposition">Ron repeats the word "immortal" in surprise</a>, only for Hermione to explain "It means you'll never die," just in case any of the kids in the audience don't know that word. Ron gets indignant and says "I <em>know</em> what it means," because there's really no reason for him not to.
</li><li> There's a strange in-universe example in the first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em>; a school textbook Harry is reading feels the need to explain to its readers what "Muggle" means.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> is as appallingly loaded with As You Know as any book ever written.
<ul><li> The chapter where the villain first appears consists entirely of As You Know dialogue, complete with having the villain <em>introduce himself</em> to his chief henchman: "Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?" Justified by Baron Harkonnen being so fond of describing plans that at one point he <em>himself</em> admits to it being a flaw.
</li><li> "The Spice must flow!" (Usually accompanied by a summary of its multipurpose nature.)
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> book where an important tribal custom is explained to the <em>son of the recently deceased chieftain</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3anai');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3anai" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3anai');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the record, there's a sword with a wavy edge (the sea) and a straight one (the land).

</li><li> CS Forester neatly justifies it in a couple of places in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> books, where a junior officer begins an explanation to a senior officer with this in order to maintain a properly deferential tone while in fact telling the senior officer something he probably didn't know, but should have known.
</li><li> SF writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson">Poul Anderson</a> called this an "idiot lecture", in the sense that either the lecturer must be an idiot, or the lecturer must think the lecturee is an idiot. Nevertheless Anderson used the device often at the beginning of short stories, usually to establish historical details when an operative was briefed by a superior. Lampshaded at least once via the lecturee thinking to himself "He must think I'm an idiot!" and similar. In more than one Anderson story, such a speech is delivered <em>to an enemy</em> and reveals something that really ought not to be revealed to an enemy ("and that's why we 'elves' can't stand iron"), followed by "added hastily" in a blatant (yet always successful) attempt to distract from said revelation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HugoAward">Hugo Gernsback's</a> classic SF novel <em>Ralph 124C 41+ </em> frequently uses this phrase to explain how the future works.
</li><li> The T'ang Chinese characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee">Judge Dee</a></em> mysteries spend a surprising amount of time explaining their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">culture and customs</a> to each other for the benefit of the Western readers.
</li><li> The problem is routinely &mdash; and hilariously &mdash; lampshaded by narrator Bertie Wooster in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JeevesAndWooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JeevesAndWooster">Jeeves and Wooster</a></em> stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P.

Justified by having Dedoblanco play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a> by having failed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual">Read the Freaking Manual</a>, much to the exasperation of Jongleur, the group's leader.
</li><li> About half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredricBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredricBrown">Fredric Brown</a>'s short story "Keep Out" is one character giving backstory to a group of other characters, including the narrator, who then tells the reader, "Of course we had known a lot of those things already."
</li><li> Justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordDarcy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordDarcy">Lord Darcy</a></em> books, where Master Sean natters on about the underlying principles of whatever spell he uses to examine crime scenes and clues, even though Darcy's surely heard all this before. Darcy actually <em>insists</em> that Sean do this, as it helps him overcome his own innate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggle</a> mental blocks about how magic operates; plus, as Master Sean is also a professor, he performs best while in classroom-lecture mode. Darcy also claims to almost always learn some new little tidbit of information each time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:

A footnote explains that what he actually means is "I'm not sure you know this..."
<ul><li> Justified again in the third <em>Science</em> book, when Ponder's reports on the situation go ignored and he has to explain himself all over again on the spot, using this trope to let his colleagues save face.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wintersmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wintersmith">Wintersmith</a></em>: Tiffany ends up having to do this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> Anagramma, because just asking her to show you how to do something just results in a lot of stalling until she says she has a migraine.

<ul><li> The fundamentals of furycrafting are presented by Tavi to Max as if it's a necessary refresher because he's such a bad student.
</li><li> The author has noted that there were some significant bits of backstory and world-building that he ended up leaving out or delaying in order to avoid slipping into this trope. He took four books to explain that "-ar" at the end of someone's surname name meant they were illegitimate, and never got round to explaining that the line of Gaius had restarted at "Primus" dozens of times in the past (with Gaius Sextus being the fourth First Lord with that name) because all of the viewpoint characters would have already known all about it from basic history classes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFosterWallace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidFosterWallace">David Foster Wallace</a> mentions this in a footnote in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePaleKing">The Pale King</a></em>, calling it an irksome and graceless dramatic contrivance.
</li><li> Sort of, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SplinterOfTheMindsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SplinterOfTheMindsEye">Splinter of the Mind's Eye</a></em>. Luke Skywalker, pretending to be a local miner, asks a real local a question about the locale. The response starts with an as you know &mdash; the real local thinks Luke knows the first part of what he's imparting, though just like the readers, he does not.
</li><li> Played with during the last part of George Stewart's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthAbides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthAbides">Earth Abides</a></em>. The protagonist, Ish, is now an old man, spending most of his time in a mental fog, cared for by others. When this fog lifts, Ish discusses the current state of the Tribe with Jack, his great-grandson and caretaker. Almost every answer Jack offers is punctuated with, "...as you yourself well know, Ish," even though Ish is, at this point, as clueless as the reader.
</li><li> Subverted by Robert Jordan: he seems to beat this trope to death with the copious amounts of exposition in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">Wheel of Time</a></em> series to recap events already firmly established in previous novels in the series, many of which was delivered through character dialogue; somewhat justified by the Door Stopper size of the series and difficulty in keeping track of the myriad of dangling plot threads one might think. But the reiterations most often are either new information for one or more of the people present, discussions about different opinions, or depictions of events that were influenced by the ones shown in earlier books.
</li><li> From the book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wonderstruck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wonderstruck">Wonderstruck</a></em>, we have this clunky bit of exposition (granted, considering that part of the story was told entirely in pictures, it was hard to do it any other way):
<div class="indent"><strong>Girl:</strong> (<em>writes</em>) Thank you! <br><strong>Man:</strong> (<em>writes</em>) You're welcome, sister!

<div class="indent"><em>[Sparhawk takes cover as a troop of soldiers marches by]</em> <br><strong>Lieutenant:</strong> It's that place in Rose Street where the Pandions try to hide their ungodly subterfuge. They know we're watching, of course, but our presence restricts their movements and leaves his Grace, the primate, free from their interference. <br><strong>Corporal:</strong> We know the reasons, Lieutenant. We've been doing this for over a year now.
</div></li><li> A top secret memo in <em>Icons</em> by Margaret Stohl explains "as we all know, the Lords activated the Icons and [killed one billion people]," just in case the ambassador to the aliens forgot that they conquered the planet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstLaw">Before They Are Hanged</a></em> includes an early briefing for military officers ending, "That fortress, as we all know, is already in the hands of the enemy." This is an aversion, as the officers in question are useless nobles who have only the faintest grasp of the war. The briefing officer is a commoner who rose through the ranks and has enough sense not to say, "as you ought to know."
</li><li> Used to lead off the briefing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on the VX nerve gas</span> at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PaladinOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PaladinOfShadows">A Deeper Blue</a></em>.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SheepsClothing">Sheep's Clothing</a></em>. While the <em>reader</em> probably knows a thing or two about vampires, Doc&mdash;and most frontier folks west of the Mississippi&mdash;isn't familiar with them at all.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a>: Earth Strike</em> when Rear Admiral Koenig explains to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">Senate liaison</a> John Quintanilla why the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcubierreDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcubierreDrive">their engines</a> work means they can't reinforce the twelve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">SG-92 Starhawks</a> they sent on a near-<em>c</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">Alpha Strike</a> at the start of the book. Quintanilla's a civilian and probably <em>doesn't</em> understand this stuff.
</li><li> Aunt Jocelyn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StrengthAndJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StrengthAndJustice">Strength &amp; Justice</a>: Side: Justice</em> says this phrase word for word while telling Teremy the reason why anyone can possess a superpower. It's very clearly for the benefit of the reader, since Teremy obviously knows it already.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DestinedToLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DestinedToLead">Destined to Lead</a></em> book 2, <em>Healing</em>, Resurge, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> uses this trope to explain why he knows who on Mysterium 'Gakkar' is, and by extension the giant stone golem they are conversing with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a>,</em> the first chapter is usually dedicated to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingProtagonist">Rotating Protagonist</a> explaining the series' concept (the Earth is being invaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Puppeteer Parasites</a>, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">turn into animals</a> to fight them, etc.) Clearly this is being done for people who picked up the books out of order, but by the last few entries the narrators start throwing in "but you know this already."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTerminalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTerminalMan">The Terminal Man</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a>, a forensic pathologist tells psychiatrist Janet Ross "As you know, the male pubic hair" is different from the female pubic hair.

Card notes that this trope was very common in the early days of SF, and he provides a humorous example of what it often sounded like:
<div class="indent">"As you know, Dr. Smith, the rebolitic manciplator causes the electrons of any given group of atoms to reverse their charge and become anti-electrons." <br>"Yes, Dr. Whitley, and of course that will cause an immediate explosion unless the rebolitic manciplation is conducted inside an extremely powerful Boodley field." <br>"And the only facility in Nova Scotia that is capable of maintaining a Boodley field of sufficient power is&mdash;" <br>"That's right. Dr. Malifax's lab on his houseboat in the Bay of Fundy."
</div></li><li> The novel <em>Mirage</em> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFollett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFollett">James Follett</a> is based on the real-life espionage by Israel of the blueprints of the Mirage fighter aircraft after France stopped supplying the aircraft and parts after the initial sale and Israel wanted to keep the ones they had in flying condition (and eventually built their own version, the Kfir). During the briefing given during the planning of the operation a politician asks why they can't simply reverse-engineer or copy parts from their existing stocks or by removing them from planes. While one engineer who obviously knows why has a "for god's sake" reaction a second, more people-savvy engineer cuts him off saying that from a layman's perspective it's a reasonable question and deserves an answer. He then explains about while they might be able to physically copy the shape of a particular part it's much harder to exactly duplicate the alloy used and the manufacturing processes, such as the correct hardening and tempering required to make the part able to correctly handle the stresses involved in combat flight conditions. He uses the analogy of his pocket lighter, saying that if they made their best efforts, they could eventually duplicate the lighter but its performance would be inferior to the production model and prone to malfunction and unexpected failures. Multiplying the few components of the lighter up to thousands of parts in a modern jet fighter makes the entire idea untenable. The politician then understands why detailed blueprints with all of the technical specifications of each part are required and gives the go-ahead for the espionage attempt.

The occasion is used to walk the audience through the theory and past few years of work for the project, despite the fact that the oversight board should know all this from previous meetings. Further, the board is <em>surprised</em> when the project lead points out that their years-old contract keeps all data and documentation subject to the team's discretion.

</li><li> Similarly, the exposition in <em>The Brothers Menaechmus</em> is presented in such a ludicrous manner (essentially, "Tell me, Menaechmus, what have we been doing for the last six years?") that it's obviously a big wink to the audience.

Hatton asks Raleigh what the military preparations for the Spanish attack mean, and Raleigh replies in a series of speeches all beginning with the assertion that "You know...", while Hatton agrees that he indeed knows. Finally Mr. Dangle interrupts to ask "as he knows all this, why does Sir Walter go on telling him?" Mr. Puff retorts that "the audience are not supposed to know anything of the matter, are they?.....

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first case in each game requires the player to get a quick introduction to the gameplay details. This makes perfect sense in the first game because Phoenix Wright has just come out of college, but not so much in the next two games, considering they still star him after a good number of trials. The second game features a bout of amnesia, whereas the third one is actually a flashback to the second case of Mia Fey, Phoenix's mentor, who'd taken some time off due to being traumatized by the outcome of the first (when you actually get to play her first case, though, she doesn't get any As You Know assistance, possibly due to her different co-counsel).
</li><li> The fourth game introduces a new protagonist, Apollo Justice - but you can actually skip the tutorial here, as Apollo has watched Kristoph Gavin cross-examine several witnesses and is fully aware of the process.
</li><li> The Miles Edgeworth spin-off uses his partner, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessDetective">Clueless Detective</a> Gumshoe, to handle this as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>. Still, several characters keep reminding Edgeworth how to <em>use logic</em> (a gameplay mechanic exclusive to the spinoff).
</li><li> The fifth game <em>Dual Destinies</em> has this as an option and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>. If the player opts to get an introduction on the mechanics of the game, Phoenix (a seasoned lawyer at this point) asks his rookie partner Athena Cykes to explain how the court system works in the game. However, it's done not so much for Phoenix's sake but for Athena's since she just suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> moments before. Phoenix believes that having Athena explain the rules to him will bring her confidence back up.
</li><li> And, again, in <em>Spirit of Justice</em>. This time, however, the justification is that Phoenix has to explain the process of cross-examination to <em>the judge</em>, who hasn't had to preside over a cross-examination for a witness's testimony in over twenty years, and has forgotten the protocol for the process. This happens again in the third case, where Maya asks if Nick should be reminded of how to cross-examine Rayfa's insights for her divination s&eacute;ances, a new gameplay feature that was only shown for the first time two cases ago.

The reason for this is because the shows episodes were originally aired in two parts, so a quick recap was warranted since the second part of the episode wouldn't always follow up the first part right away.

<ul><li> One episode lampshades this practice. A character from an earlier episode returns, and Charles/Mambo (siamese twins who have one body with two heads) tell Duckman it's that woman he used to date, who used to be hideous but became gorgeous through plastic surgery and left him. Duckman responds to the effect of "Don't you think I know that?", to which the twins respond with "That wasn't for you. That was exposition for the 99.9 percent of the audience who are usually out having a life on Saturday night instead of staying home and flipping through obscure cable channels hoping to catch a little softcore pornography"
</li><li> Another example: To suggest how ordinary his life is, Duckman describes the ironically ridiculous premise of the show to Cornfed in one sentence: "I'm just another duck detective, who works with a pig and lives with the twin sister of his dead wife, has three sons on two bodies, and a comatose mother-in-law whose got so much gas she's fire hazard."
</li><li> Bernice: "As I explained to you before and will repeat now, not as clunky exposition but just because it feels so damn good..."

Make way for the Princess of Dendron! <br><strong>Duckman:</strong> Thanks for the exposition. Who's tall, dark and creepy? <br><strong>Expositor:</strong> Beware! Beware! That is the Sultan's Fahaer Achmed Amazher. An evil man full of tricks and tourchers and torments. It is said when the moon is full he... <br><strong>Duckman:</strong> All right. Thank you.

<ul><li> An incident features Sokka bumbling through an explanation of his battle plan, finally getting so nervous that he just starts recapping the entire series, getting to the sixth episode before his father steps in.
</li><li> The show featured some elegantly natural subversions or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, as well: in the very first episode, Katara irately tries to exposit at Sokka, who cuts her off with an "I know, I know..." before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">delivering the exposition himself</a>. Similarly, Zuko asks Azula a question almost anyone in-universe would know the answer to, prompting her to ask "Didn't you pay attention in school?" while giving the exposition anyway.
</li><li> At the end of the episode, Zuko, having been told by Iroh to find the secret history of how his great-grandfather died, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">angrily complains about having been told to look for something everyone in the Fire Nation knows</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it turns out Iroh was talking about his <em>other</em> great-grandfather, Avatar Roku</span>.
</li><li> Another good example occurred on "The Day of Black Sun," when Zuko is finishing up in the throne room confronting his father, and about to leave. Fire Lord Ozai tries to keep Zuko around long enough for the sun to come back with a mention of his Missing Mom. The story starts with: "My father, Fire Lord Azulon..." Did Ozai not expect Zuko (much like the vast majority of the audience at home) not to know who has been his grandfather, and Fire Lord, for the vast majority of his life? They were likely trying to rope in new viewers at the time, and were probably trying to explain things to them, but the words still sounded weird.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">Exploited</a> by the villains. While disguised as Kyoshi Warriors, Ty Lee and Mai gave some quite clunky exposition to each other.

<ul><li> Lampshaded in the episode "24 Minutes" (which was a <em>24</em> parody), where Lisa begins some exposition...
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa:</strong> Principal Skinner, as we both know but you might need reminding, the annual Bake Sale provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckySchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckySchool">90% of the school's funding</a>...
</div></li><li> Spoofed outright in another episode in which Homer needlessly recounts step-by-step his <em>purchase of an ice cream cone</em> with no plot significance whatsoever, to his family, who were there, a few minutes ago. And when he's called out for it by Bart, he starts <em>narrating this very same dialogue that just happened</em>, before being interrupted by the plot.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>: "I hope nothing unsavory happens during my visit. As you know, I am the president of the United States." A Movie Within a Show has a slightly more subtle example, as, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrSmithGoesToWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrSmithGoesToWashington">Mr. Smith</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodierAndGorier">kills all of the other congressmen</a>, a man burst into the room and says "I'm the President of the United States and I demand to know what's going on here!"
</li><li> Another obvious spoof:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture. <br><strong>Lisa:</strong> We know, Dad. <br><strong>Homer:</strong> I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend this self-help seminar. <br><strong>Bart:</strong> What an odd thing to say.
</div></li><li> And yet again:
<div class="indent"><strong>Marge:</strong> How exciting! Watching a movie outside with the whole town! <br><strong>Comic Book Guy:</strong> Yes, thank you for talking to all of us like we just tuned in.
</div></li><li> In the episode, "Lisa the Simpson", Lisa imagines a bad future where she's an obese white trash mother who's married to Ralph Wiggum. When Ralph walks in he says, "Hi Lisa. It's me Ralph, your husband" as if she didn't already know. This gets spoofed later in the episode, when present day Homer goes, "Hi Lisa. It's me, your father, Daddy."
</li><li> Parodied rather sweetly in a Season 27 episode which has a scene with Marge explaining to Homer where they are currently driving to and for what purpose. When Homer asks her why she is telling him this when he already knows, Marge replies that she just likes talking to him. The scene ends with them wordlessly smiling at each other.
</li></ul></li><li> Spoofed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em>, during a conversation that came with captions indicating which of the statements were "IMPORTANT" or "NOT IMPORTANT". The As You Know conversation eventually degraded into spewing frivolous things like "I'm wearing blue socks" (captioned with "NOT IMPORTANT") and "You know, if you mix baking soda and vinegar together, you can make a little volcano." ("NOT IMPORTANT... BUT INTERESTING")
</li><li> This comes up rather often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> Season 1, since the series starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a>. J&eacute;r&eacute;mie is usually the one stuck with frequently reminding his friends about information that they would already know &mdash; like the basic properties of the world of Lyoko, the monsters' stats, the fact that they couldn't let anyone die before a Return to the Past or that their main goal is to materialize Aelita.

<div class="indent"><strong>Everyone:</strong> <em>(gasps)</em> <br><strong>Stan:</strong> Oh, good, we all know who Fernando Jaramillo is, so we don't have to waste time explaining it to each other! <br><strong>Janitor:</strong> <em>(appearing from nowhere)</em> I don't know who he is. <br><strong>Stan:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Oh, well let me explain it to you</a>.

Rather than simply say the character's name, Mr. or Ms. Exposition also has to spout out a long-winded explanation of who they are. The most blatant example is when they explained to the audience that Mark was an alien and now living on Earth disguised as a human, even going so far as to have Timmy place a device in front of the fourth wall that lets the viewer see Mark under his disguise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Quagmire's "That one was also sexual" line. Initially it looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Don't Explain the Joke</a>, but according to the DVD commentary, it was a spoof of characters saying things that no-one would really say to explain the plot, like "I can't wait for the bake sale this afternoon!"
</li><li> Another parody of the trope comes in the episode "Prick Up Your Ears", when in a sketch by the "Opal Ring Crusaders" the school brought in to teach sex ed, a joking reference is made to a Jefferson High.

<ul><li> Education:
<ul><li> Talking like this can be a hazard of the teaching profession, as relating things to students who <em>don't</em> know things can become such a habit that you slip into "lecture mode", even with colleagues already aware of the facts.
</li><li> This trope can also be justified for students: asking someone to explain something you already know is one way of testing whether <em>they</em> know it. If the student does know, explaining something to someone that already knows it will naturally follow.
</li><li> This is also a rather standard occurrence in places with a 'spiral' school system. That is, every few years every subject comes back with a bit more detail and a bit more backgrounds and a bit different connections. As in: "We did tell you about this a few years ago. This is what we left out." Which will usually result in being told about any given subject multiple times, all but the first of them starting with a short re-introduction to the subject, frequently done in an 'as you know' style. This is generally followed by explaining which parts of what you know were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren">simplifications</a> that were good enough for the previous level but must now be unlearned.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a word in several European languages which has this purpose: Swedish <em>ju</em>, Danish <em>jo</em>, Polish <em>tak</em> and German <em>ja</em> (not to be confused with cases where <em>ja</em> or <em>tak</em> simply means "yes"). They are used when stating a fact that you assume that other party to already be a familiar with:
<div class="indent"><strong>Swedish:</strong> Bussen anl&auml;nder ju klockan nio. <br><strong>Polish:</strong> Tak, autobus przyje&#380;d&#380;a o dziewi&#261;tej. <br><strong>German:</strong> Der Bus kommt ja um neun Uhr. <br><strong>English:</strong> The bus <em>does</em> arrive at nine o'clock, as you know.
</div></li><li> "As you know" is often used in business correspondence to avoid insulting the recipient's intelligence, especially when the writer is not sure whether or not the recipient actually knows the information. It is especially common when at least one of the correspondents is Japanese and can sometimes become an empty formalism.
<ul><li> Outside of business correspondence, it can also be used when reiterating a point or reminding someone of something, again for the purpose of avoiding sounding condescending.
</li><li> Conversely, it can be used to convey a subtle hint of annoyance: "As I wrote in my previous email..." (translation: if you had bothered to pay attention earlier I wouldn't have to explain it again, you jerk) or "As you know, [recipient's proposed course of action] is considered bad-faith litigation and may lead to sanctions and an award of attorney's fees" (translation: Did you really think you could get away with that?).
</li></ul></li><li> Used a great deal in politics to convince the audience that they've always agreed with the candidate "As you all know my opponent hates freedom and only I can save this nation." Crowd: "Oh yeah, we, uh, knew that."
</li><li> Often a pitfall of a real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a> &mdash; much to the chagrin of said Captain's friends, neighbors, co-workers and acquaintances.
</li><li> When addressing a class or other group, this can mean "As most of you know, but for the benefit of those who weren't paying attention, ..."
</li><li> Sometimes used in the military to make sure everyone knows the <em>exact same</em> version of the intelligence or orders given.
</li><li> Another use for this approach in real life is to make sure that the listener is thinking about the same things as the speaker. A professional physicist doesn't need to have Newton's laws of motion explained to him, but opening a presentation on ballistics with "As you know, a body in motion remains in motion unless acted on by an external force" is a good way to get your audience thinking about the laws of motion instead of, say, electromagnetism or their smartphones.
</li><li> People with autism often lecture as a form of stress relief. The topic can be anything from something the lecturing person is particularly interested in to something that just happened in front of the lecturer and their audience. Saying "we already know this" isn't very likely to stop the lecture.
</li><li> Academic/technical papers sometimes slip into this, since (a) your audience <em>probably</em> knows, but you can't necessarily rely on it, and (b) it's sometimes really hard to introduce or sum up your research without a dose of near-meaningless boilerplate to get the prose started. From an Intel <a class="urllink" href="http://download.intel.com/pressroom/pdf/computertrendsrelease.pdf">paper<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on computational electrical efficiency:
<div class="indent"> The performance of electronic computers has shown remarkable and steady growth over the past 60 years, a finding that is not surprising to anyone with even a passing familiarity with computing technology.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar">This Means War!</a> is not diplomatic. As a consequence, Charles Francis Adams, the American ambassador to England during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, sent a note to the British government with the sentence: "It would be superfluous of me to point out to your Lordship that this is war."
</li><li> Championships, events like the Olympics, or sports that are not usually on Network TV can do this throughout the broadcast. While rule changes, late injuries, or time (in the non-annual events like The World Cup, Olympics, Ryder Cup, or Commonwealth Games) justifies this to a point, the broadcast has to balancing this from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">completely dumbing down the product</a>.
<ul><li> The worst offenders can be during pre-game shows that can last longer then the event themselves. Those viewers are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">way into the event.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> A very common thing with police interviews when they are recorded. Often the police will go through with the person of interest what they know and what has already happened several times so that there is a record of the police stating these have happened with the person of interest agreeing that they have.
