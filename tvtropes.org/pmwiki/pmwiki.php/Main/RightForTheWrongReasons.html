After talking with Tagoma, Sorbet demands that his wish be granted. Shenron calls it a foolish wish, but grants it anyway. As it turns out, the wish <em>was</em> foolish, albeit not for the reason Shenron originally stated.

</li><li> In "Performing with Fiery Charm!", Upon seeing Serena's new look, Miette had the right conclusion that she did it for a reason but had the facts wrong as she thought she changed her appearances out of Ash rejecting her, although it was also a little teasing.

However, Ash was just as right and wrong as well as he was right that not everything is gonna be everyone business but was wrong to lash out at Serena for just trying to help. Also, while looking for Ash in a snowstorm, Serena was right that he took off further alone for a reason but she thought he did was because of how she yelled back at him. However, Ash did clear things up with Serena as he told her what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">she said</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">helped him pull himself together</a> and not worse, which was also an apology from their argument.

While he's right about the fact that Uraraka had a plan, she actually <em>declined</em> Midoriya's help, wanting to win or lose on her own merit. Midoriya sets the record straight after the match when Bakugo demands to know if that plan was indeed his.
<ul><li> Todoroki is almost immediately able to pinpoint that Midoriya has some form of relationship with All Might and is All Might's protege due to sharing the same quirk. However, he mistakenly believes that Midoriya is All Might's illegitimate son.

As we find out later on in the episode, that is probably the most accurate comparison that could possibly be made since they're almost identical to her back in the first season (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo">completely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClonesArePeopleToo">human</a> despite their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">artificial nature</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">driven to help a dying mother figure</a>, and suffering to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">you just want to give them a hug</a>).

She came to this conclusion because as she was stalking Madoka, she saw her and Kyosuke enter the ABCB and heard the noise of lovemaking soon after, not imagining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">it was actually a porn movie put on by Hikari, Madoka's best friend and Kyosuke's girlfriend, without knowing what it actually was</a>.

He makes up tragic backstories for them and guesses that Nico got in for drug peddling, Rock broke out to see a friend, and Jyugo being involved in all of it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was right about them having tragic backstories, but Rock <em>made</em> a friend when he escaped since Jyugo took him to a restaurant so he could eat good food away from wardens who looked down on him, Nico's unwitting involvement in drug peddling landed him in a jail that used him as a human guinea pig, and Jyugo really did connect the group, but it's through him helping them with their problems rather than them helping him.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsekaiDeKojiinWoHiraitakedoNazekaDarehitoriSudatouToShiaiKen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsekaiDeKojiinWoHiraitakedoNazekaDarehitoriSudatouToShiaiKen">Isekai De Kojiin Wo Hiraitakedo Nazeka Darehitori Sudatou To Shiai Ken</a>, the king who summons an entire class to a new world to fight the demon king, sends the protagonist, Shinji Naomi off to run an orphanage, seeing him as a worthless incompetent, because while the rest of his class all get nifty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> skills useful only in warfare, Shinji gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> "protect" and "analyze" skills. What the king fails to realize, is that Shinji is <em>the perfect choice</em> to run an orphanage because he's honest, forthright, trustworthy, and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>. Not to mention that his "protect" skill works best when he <em>wants</em> to protect something, and there's no way Shinji would want to protect the class that constantly mocks and derides him, back on Earth or in this new world.
</li><li> This happens a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, mostly in the manga version:
<ul><li> Aizawa once mentions that deaths having occurred at Kira's hand while Light was under surveillance doesn't necessarily prove Light's innocence, saying that Light could have killed when he was in a situation where he wasn't being watched by the cameras; while Aizawa is right here in that this incident indeed does not prove Light's innocence (as he had an alibi where he was able to find a way to access criminals' names and faces <em>while</em> being under surveillance), Aizawa misses the point here. The issue is not that criminals died while Light's activities were being closely monitored, but rather that criminals died while Light had no way of gaining information about them.
</li><li> When Mello is attacked by the Task Force and Soichiro reveals he knows Mello's true name, Mello concludes that this is because Kira controlled one of Mello's subordinates into revealing his name, meaning that the Task Force has teamed up with Kira. However, while Mello is right about the Task Force having teamed up with Kira, the only reason they know Mello's real name is because of the fact that Soichiro took the Shinigami Eye deal.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Mello reveals to Near that one of the rules in the Death Note is fake, Near narrows down the fake rule to the 13-day-rule. Near is right in assuming this, but his thought process for eliminating another fake rule (that the whoever touched the notebook will die if it is destroyed) was that Mello could not have learned about that rule being fake because Mello could not have tested that rule. However, the reason Mello learned of the fake rule was not because of his testing, but rather because a Shinigami told him.</span>
</li><li> When Light has Kiyomi Takada say things that are uncharacteristic of her to say as a newscaster (her sharing her personal opinions about Kira), Mikami finds something off, and concludes that someone must have made her act this way, and comes to the conclusion that she is having meetings with Kira. While it is true she was having meetings with Light, Takada herself didn't even know that Light was Kira, meaning Kira could very well have not been the only person to have her say such things.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Light eventually concludes that Near has figured out that the second L, Kira, is Light Yagami. However, Light thinks Near deduces this because of Light's connection to Misa Amane, the alleged former Second Kira, and the election of Kiyomi Takada, someone who was once close to him. While Near most certainly did figure out Light is the second L and Kira, it was not for these reasons. To add an extra layer to that, had Near concluded that Light is the second L from Takada's election, that would have also been an instance of Right For The Wrong Reasons, because Takada's election had nothing to do with Light and her connection to Light was nothing but a coincidence.</span>

<ul><li> Karen is a rabid Kaguya/Shirogane shipper, and is wholly convinced that the two are hopelessly in love with each other (something that her best friend Erika dismisses as fangirlish delusions).

</li><li> Iino has a tendency to interpret things in a sexual way, the most glaring example being when Tsubame invites Ishigami to her home on Christmas Eve, which she interprets as a sex invitation, when Tsubame actually intends to invite everyone from the Culture Festival Committee to her Christmas party (which Iino interprets to be an orgy). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, Iino is completely right that Tsubame intended to have sex with Ishigami on that night.

Marcille argues for the method she was taught, where the mandrake is pulled from the ground by an animal, which is killed by the scream while the harvester hides out of range. Senshi argues for his self-taught method, where he quickly cuts the head off the mandrake before it can scream while pulling it. Marcille argues that her method is traditional and therefore better, but the others agree with Senshi that his own method is safer and more efficient (and doesn't kill some poor dog), leading Marcille to try to use it herself (in the process nearly getting herself killed). However, when Senshi looks over the mandrake harvested by Marcille's methods, he realizes that her mandrake <em>is</em> better than his; since it gets off a scream, this gets rid of a lot of toxins and produces a tastier and more nutritious mandrake. He concedes to Marcille that sometimes a more efficient method doesn't always get you the best results.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Watamote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Watamote">Watamote</a></em> has Tomoko assuming that Nemo has to be bi or a lesbian. Why?

Ironically, later on, Ucchi does something similar when she assumes that Tomoko is also attracted to girls, which seems to be more or less true&mdash;but she assumes this because she thinks Tomoko is attracted to <em>her</em> (she isn't).

He stops the Riddler shortly before Batman, who has finished his own case and seen the clue, shows up. However, when they compare notes, they have completely different interpretations of what the riddle means, even though they both connected it to the same crime. Basically, either Batman, Commissioner Gordon, or <em>both</em> were Right For The Wrong Reasons&#151;and out of sheer spite, the Riddler won't say which.
<ul><li> A story from the 90s saw Batman deal with a clay Golem destroying Jewish business in Gotham. A large clockwise swastika on the golem's belly led Batman to believe that the Golem's creator was being forced to send it out and the Buddhist-style swastika was a clue to his identity (someone educated enough to know about Yiddish traditions and the swastika's history). When Batman tracks down the creator (a Warsaw ghetto survivor being forced by a gang of Neo-Nazis), the man tells Batman he knew nothing about Buddhism: the swastika was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">Stealth Insult</a> to his captors, as he couldn't bring himself to draw the counter-clockwise Nazi swastika and his captors were too ignorant to tell he drew it wrong.

</li><li> Something similar is going on with the heavily conservative New Frontiersman, which manages to correctly poke at elements that suggest the very real conspiracy going on: things like Doug Roth's distrust of Doctor Manhattan being suspicious or the disappearance of various artists and scientists being part of a wider pattern. However, the editors of the New Frontiersman didn't really reach these conclusions through logical means; they just rooted around for any evidence that their left-leaning opposition was up to no good and then started throwing out wild guesses.

Sure enough, an attempt is made on Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias's life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Veidt is behind it all. He killed the Comedian because he knew too much about his plans and sent an assassin against himself to throw off suspicion.

</li><li> Used on a more practical note in chapter 34; while Fleur's Veela senses make her aware that Harry is having sex with multiple girls, she initially assumes that he is cheating on Ginny rather than consider alternative explanations, although Ginny soon clarifies the truth of Harry's current sexual activities in chapter 36.
</li><li> A lesser example in chapter 35, when Cho assumes that Harry never considered her for his new relationships because she 'didn't put out'; Cho is correct that Harry didn't consider her as one of his new partners, but that was actually because Harry didn't like the way Cho treated Luna rather than because she didn't want to have sex.

At this point, they do not know that the aliens have sent them this DNA, because the creating hybrids can reproduce on Earth and wipe out humanity.
<ul><li> The assumption that a female is less dangerous and aggressive than a male is wrong, because in the animal species on Earth mostly the opposite is the case. Birds, insects, amphibians, in most species females are larger, stronger and more aggressive than males. Mammals are the only exception. And even female mammals do not like it at all when someone approaches their kittens. So what made the scientists believe that it would be completely different in an alien species?
</li><li> However, the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeciesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeciesII">Species II</a></em> shows that the decision was correct because female hybrids reproduce much more slowly and therefore can create fewer hybrids in a very short period of time.

</li><li> Lady Barbrey Dustin is 100% convinced that maesters are not the neutral players in the political game that they claim to be. She points out how all their useful functions as servators, such as reading, writing, overseeing the ravens and healing, are specifically designed to lull Lords into not questioning the motives behind the advice they give. All so that the Citadel may uncontestedly rule from the shadows, puppeteers of all who dance on their strings. Yes... But, seriously... no. They really aren't completely neutral and many <em>do</em> have agendas... Which are mostly cultural or personal ones, not necessarily institutional or familial ones. See, they don't kid about wanting to serve and educate, but there are political factions within the Citadel divided on how best to do that, and individual maesters can fall into any camp with differing degrees and methods of active participation in wider society. Ruling from the shadows isn't on the table as a concerted, overriding consensus agenda, however. Every initiate of the Citadel we get much insight of, from the surrogate parent of Maester Cressen, the sleazy Maester Pycelle, the dedicatedly heretical ex-maester Qyburn to the sincerely devoted Maester Luwin and others... they all have <em>many</em> reasons behind the biases they act on; mostly personal ones.

Lung agrees without any resistance, surprising her. What Tattletale didn't know is that the Y&agrave;ngb&#462;n had previously held Lung prisoner and attempted to brainwash him, so he hates them <em>far</em> more than he does the Undersiders. Tattletale then complains about getting credit for brilliant insights she didn't actually have.

The example given is that one such old grimoire states that to free a town of plague, one must first free it of rats, which is of course true. The problem is that the grimoire's writer believed that the reason for this was because both plague and rats fall under the auspices of the Moon, so the rats were spreading plague by bringing the influence of the Moon into people's houses.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, Drew Misham, an art forger, had a postage stamp framed for whatever reason. Said postage stamp happened to have a powerful poison on its back. Seven years later, Drew dies from licking the stamp to use it. It's suggested that the art forger had the stamp framed because he knew it was poisoned. Apollo, assuming this to be true, makes quite an impressive leap of logic: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drew is not the art forger, but rather he acts as the face of one, namely his daughter Vera. SHE had the stamp framed, allegedly suspecting the poison, and later Drew, who suspected nothing, used the stamp and died of the poison.</span> Almost all of the above is true... except the stamp was framed because Drew's daughter liked the picture on it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a> 2</em>, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Yumihiko Ichiyanagi</a>'s early arguments actually turns out to be a case of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Manousuke Naito is found dead in prison, so Yumihiko has Souta Sarushiro arrested simply because he happened to be Naito's friend, then comes up with a flimsy reasoning involving a chess board he sent to the prison as a gift containing a chisel in a secret compartment. Everyone both in-universe and out laughs this off at the time, however, it is revealed <em>much</em> later that Souta is the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game, and while he didn't personally murder Naito, he did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">manipulate events with the explicit intention of him ending up dead</a>, the chisel was planted in the compartment for that very purpose, <em>and</em> his motive for doing so did indeed involve their friendship (more specifically, Souta believed Naito had betrayed that friendship due to an event Naito himself doesn't even remember).</span>
</li><li> There's a weird "non-culprit" example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney &#150; Dual Destinies</a></em>. In case 2, much of the case revolves around the fact that nobody is supposed to enter the Forbidden Chamber because supposedly, an evil demon named "Tenma Taro" is locked inside. Naturally, some characters treat this as mere superstition, and some characters treat this as real. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">yes, it's just superstition, there is no demon. <em>But</em>, there <em>is</em> a good reason not to go into the Forbidden Chamber anyway: it turns out that "Tenma Taro" is actually the name of a gold ingot that, when it first appeared, caused the villagers to fight over the gold out of greed, <em>as if</em> they were possessed by monsters. So there's actually a good reason to keep the Forbidden Chamber locked up, because if people saw there was gold in there, they'd start fighting over it again.</span>
</li><li> An out of universe example, from <em>Dual Destinies</em>. The player, especially if they kept up with the promotional material for the game including the initial teaser trailer, is going to assume that Tonate is the culprit of the first case, since he's presented as the obvious guy who really obviously committed the bombing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He IS the culprit of the first case, but not because he's the bomber.

However, the first accusation is based on an incorrect interpretation of the evidence, and the second time, they still haven't completely eliminated the possibility that both victims were killed by different people (Monokuma will only punish <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Angie's</span> murderer, so voting for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Korekiyo</span> when they only confessed to killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tenko</span> might still get everyone killed); amusingly enough, this leads to a debate where you have to <em>side with an admitted killer</em>.

However, unlike Kyle, who's doing it because of how sick and perverted it is, Cartman's in it because he caught the pair making out in the halls without a hall pass.
</li><li> In "Cartman Finds Love" Cartman tries to force Token and Nicole together just because they're both black, but it turns out they're perfect for each other anyway.
</li><li> "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers": While being chased by the 6th grade army who want to get their videotape, Cartman suggests the group wade across a river to because he's role playing as a wizard and declares the 6th graders can't cross as a rule. When the 6th graders arrive, they actually can't cross it because the water will rust their bike chains.
</li><li> In "The Coon", Cartman was right that Mysterion's true identity was Kenny (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">something that was only made clear to the viewers later in the series</a>), but he only came to this conclusion just from the fact that Kenny had a picture of Mysterion in his locker (Stan and Clyde also have pictures of Mysterion in their lockers).

At the time, as far as the audience knew, Stella <em>was</em> the only princess of the group. Several episodes later, we learn Bloom is the lost princess, and lone survivor, of a planet whose kingdom was murdered by the Trix's ancestors. Musa was right.

Spongebob says Mr. Krabs would have thrown the apple away by now and suggests checking the dumpster for the nametag. When they get there, they discover Spongebob is wearing his shirt backward and that he's had his nametag on the whole time.
