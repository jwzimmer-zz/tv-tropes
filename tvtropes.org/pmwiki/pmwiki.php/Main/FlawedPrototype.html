</p><p>A villain may end up using a Flawed Prototype out of desperation or overeagerness to destroy the hero, despite the warnings of his scientists that it hasn't been properly tested.

However, overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> is possible, because prototypes seldom have only one significant trait, and a given instance can have both flaws and superiorities.

They had a driving force to prove themselves as valuable, having neither the dignity of being human or the pride of a normal Zoanoid.

</li><li> Unit 01 is a "test type", somewhere in between a prototype and a production model. It has its own unique bugs.
</li><li> In episode 23, we're finally shown the failed Evangelion prototypes developed prior to Unit 00, stored in what is essentially an Evangelion graveyard. The depiction differs between <a class="urllink" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vx0Gu7pPdqo/TCw4xio8EbI/AAAAAAAADUU/c7C6HQVxbh0/s1600/groundwork_23_C300_oa.gif">the original version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> and <a class="urllink" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vx0Gu7pPdqo/TCw4w9niRpI/AAAAAAAADUM/N-KNEkGSVG8/s1600/23_C300_npc_comp.jpg">the Director's Cut<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> but the verdict is the same: at least <em>fifty</em> prototypes were rejected before Unit-00 finally passed. It's hard to decide which version is worse: the Director's Cut for the pile of giant skeletons haphazardly dumped into a series of pits like garbage or the original where the bodies are laid out to show their various deformities: one doesn't have arms, just a spine and legs; another has a tail instead of legs or pelvis, etc. In any case, we get another scene in <em>End of Evangelion</em> when over a dozen five-eyed Unit-00 helmets with their spines hanging out of the bottom are piled on a rack helmet-to-helmet, many having a large red <strong>FAILED</strong> stamp on them.
</li></ul></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>:
</li><li> The original Gundam was flawed partially in the fact it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a>, it was designed to be more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> with heavy, expensive armor and had too many features that had to be removed for the GM mass production model. It turned out that Amuro's burgeoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> skills was putting extra strain on the machine (it couldn't keep up with him) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">was wearing out much faster than it should have</a>. An upgrade made at Federation headquarters Jaburo gave the Gundam magnetic joints that increased response time with less friction.
<ul><li> The Zeong from is only 80% complete when it's introduced (it's missing its legs). Since Char ends up piloting it in a space battle, however, the difference is merely cosmetic.
</li><li> The GM Cannon Test Type is a prototype for mass produced GM Cannon, it is essentially a normal GM with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Guncannon</a>'s head and two extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderCannon">shoulder cannons</a>. It doesn't take a huge guess to realize that the normal GM is too light for the shoulder cannons. The Earth Federation has to resort to rebalance the topweight of the GM and take away one of the two cannons, leading to the creation of GM Cannon, and its heavy armored dual cannons successor, the GM Cannon II, which comes with the very same Chobham Armor used by Gundam Alex as well as two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackpackCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackpackCannon">mounted beam cannons</a> fed by two large drum-like E-Caps on the backpack.
</li><li> The Gyan was eventually rejected because, while it was a powerful design at close range, it had no ranged attacks whatsoever. The Gyan's supporters had expected that it would be supported by Doms in combat, but the Principality of Zeon instead chose to go with the Gelgoog, a reliable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> design that was even more powerful than the Gundam itself.
</li><li> The Guntank can't aim its cannons horizontally, because its can't turn the torso due to the Core Block system comprised of the Driver/Pilot's Core Fighter for the torso. The mass production model fixed this easily by simply by getting rid of the Core Fighter component for a traditional torso system with rotational capabilities, and the latter RMV-1 Guntank II mass production model further enhances it by making an enlarged head turret mount for the twin 120mm cannons, allowing it to carry heavier weapons on it's arms, and lower hull.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Hyaku-Shiki</a> was originally called the "Delta Gundam", and was Anaheim Electronics' first attempt at building a transforming mobile suit. They could never get the transformation working properly though, so the mobile suit was left as a solid but overall pretty unremarkable design on par with the Gundam Mk II. Anaheim eventually succeeded with their next attempt, the Zeta Gundam. The original design was later revisited with the "Delta Plus", an upgraded version with a working transformation system based on the lessons they'd learned from the Zeta.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> designed for one of the most powerful Newtypes of the Gryps Conflict. The flaw is in the latter area; pilots like Roux Louka without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes">Super Reflexes</a> of the top-level Newtype pilots are shown having trouble keeping up with the suit's speed and transformation systems. It also doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyICanMakeItGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyICanMakeItGo">Kamille Bidan tuned the stupid thing for him and him alone</a> that not even Judau Ashta, who is a much stronger Newtype than Kamille, couldn't even make it do the miracles it did under Kamille's control.
<ul><li> On the subject of the Zeta, there's its mass-produced attempts. While the Zeta Plus line was a success, the Federation wanted something cheaper and had the Re-GZ built. But its attempts to cut costs via the Back Weapon System just made the thing way too complicated to even bother mass-producing. They would end up using the Re-ZEL, which drew its inspiration from the failed successor to the Zeta Gundam, the ZII.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">ZZ Gundam</a> is structurally very weak thanks to its transformation/combination system; eventually it was given a Full Armor upgrade mainly so it wouldn't just break to pieces if hit in the right spot. On top of that, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">hi-mega cannon</a> has incredible output, but completely drains the ZZ when used.
<ul><li> Speaking of the Full Armor upgrade, its test unit, the FAZZ from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GundamSentinel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GundamSentinel">Gundam Sentinel</a></em>, is this as while it was a test unit, it was rushed out just to test the parts. It has no anti-beam defenses, its two major beam weapons are dummies and its Beam Cannons don't double as Hyper Beam Sabers. This last one is what hurts it as all three prototypes are destroyed by the Gundam Mk-V.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular Mobile Suit of <em>Mobile Suit Moon Gundam</em> started life as the Varguil, a Neo Zeon prototype Newtype MS that would lead to the Sazabi. Sadly, the suit didn't work at all as its pilot couldn't even get its funnels to work and ended up just throwing the entire rack at an opponent. It wasn't until Neo Zeon attached the head of the Psycho Gundam Mk-IV "G-DOORS" that it became a fearsome unit.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Nu Gundam</a>, despite being awesome, is actually an incomplete prototype rushed out due to the urgency of the situation; as a result, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">fin funnels</a> are literally just slapped on the back and the psychoframe was installed but not fully integrated. The novel <em>Beltorchika's Children</em> shows the completed Nu (more commonly known as the Hi-Nu Gundam), which is superior in every area, including having dedicated mounting racks for the funnels that let them recharge.
<ul><li> Later series gives us the Mass Produced Nu Gundam, which was meant to be used by both Newtypes and Oldtypes with the help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">Mecha Expansion Pack</a>, either Fin Funnels or INCOMs. Very few are built, most of which is because the Quasi-Psycommu still isn't perfect and naturally born Newtypes are extremely rare.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular Gundam of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamNarrative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamNarrative">Mobile Suit Gundam Narrative</a></em>, the RX-9 Narrative Gundam, was designed to be a prototype of the Nu Gundam above, but since it was designed for just testing out the Psycoframe, it wasn't even fully built, leaving its upper arms, thighs and torso uncovered. Only with the usage of the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">Mecha Expansion Pack</a> that it was given did the suit become better.
</li><li> The Tallgeese of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Gundam Wing</a></em> was built <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">extremely high-spec</a>; so high, in fact, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">it killed anyone who tried piloting it</a> thanks to its murderous acceleration. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharClone">Zechs Merquise</a> pulls it out of the mothballs fifteen years later, it gives him a heart attack<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0d74t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0d74t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0d74t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">despite his being a perfectly healthy 19-year-old man</span> on his first sortie.
<ul><li> Likewise the Wing Gundam Zero, arguably the most powerful machine in the series. And all thanks to its mental interface program known as the ZERO System, which gives the pilot a neuropathic link to the Gundam and allows for speed-of-thought reactions. It does come at a hefty price: if the pilot has anything less than <em>absolutely perfect</em> focus, it overloads his brain and drives him mad. It also suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> - its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">primary weapon</a>, is massively overpowered whilst its secondaries (its shoulder-mounted Gatling guns and a pair of beam sabers) are a bit underpowered, which can be a bit of a problem if one is <em>not</em> trying to destroy everything in sight. Which is unfortunately the exact thing any pilot unable to handle the ZERO System will be driven to attempt.
</li></ul></li><li> The Zudah from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamMSIgloo">MS Igloo</a> competed with the Zaku I to be Zeon's mainline mecha. While all-around a superior machine, its engine tends to produce vibrations that shake the machine to pieces when overexerted, meaning it was passed over.
</li><li> Many Mobile Suit Variants tend to be this. Among those, the Gundam GP00 "Blossom" (precursor to the Gundams from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Stardust Memory</a></em>) tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">do everything well all at once</a> and as a result had extremely poor balance. Likewise the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Prototype Gundam Mk-II</a>, which was utterly overpowered, had poor aiming skills and cost as much to make as a battleship.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">0 Gundam</a> has extremely limited weapons (just a beam rifle and beam saber) as well as a faulty GN drive socket, resulting in massive particle leakage that resembles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGivesYouWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerGivesYouWings">phoenix wings</a>. Its in-show successor, the 00 Gundam, initially has problems synchronizing two Drives to work together without interference from each other that tends to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">trouble</a> when using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Trans-Am</a> (and even getting it to function <em>at all</em> required a compatible pair of Drives; it was lucky that two out of the five in existence turned out to be compatible because it would've taken several years and a round trip to Jupiter to make another one), but this is later fixed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">with the GN-Raiser unit</a>.
<ul><li> Graham Akre's Custom Flag from the same series is effectively an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of the Tallgeese (see above); insanely over-spec, but at Graham's request it completely lacks any safety features. The first time he uses it, he does manage to square off with the Gundam Exia on equal footing, but ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">coughing up blood</a> from the G-forces its acceleration puts on his body.
</li><li> The mass produced GN Drive [T]<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1uetu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1uetu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1uetu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">pronounced "Tau"</span> are also faulty: they lack the filter found in the true GN Drives, meaning they emit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicPhlebotinum">toxic radiation</a>; one person who survives an attack by a Tau-drive mobile suit is told that medical science can't regrow her lost hand because of this. The final mass-produced version in the second season corrects this flaw. The Tau drives also lack the true GN Drives' ability to perpetually recharge GN Particles, and will run out and shut down; while a mobile suit equipped with a true GN Drive has effectively unlimited operating time. It reveals another flaw, in that when it's own version of Trans-Am is used. Unlike a True GN drive's Trans-Am, which just simply removes the limit on how much particles the Gundam's systems can draw from it's storage tank, (and leaving the Gundam's output somewhat lowered afterwards while it recharges those particle tanks), a Tau Drive's Trans-Am is more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverDrive">Overdrive</a> that pushes it beyond it's recommended limits. When it's Trans-Am runs out, the drive is damaged beyond battle use until overhauled back at it's base, limiting the pilot to emergency reserve power. Pushed even further, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">well the mobile suit tends to explode spectacularly</a>, though it is used latter on in desperation by pilots for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Very briefly, the G-Series Mobile Suits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> and the Astray series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSEEDAstray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSEEDAstray">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray</a></em> were this: The Earth Alliance had absolutely no idea how to make an OS for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Naturals</a> and neither did ORB. Kira and the Le Creuset Team rewrote their OS on the fly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29kiy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note29kiy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29kiy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Since the Le Creuset Team were all Coordinators and had ZAFT's exsting OS as a starting point, they were able to modify their Gundams' OS into something that worked fairly easily. And Kira was a computer genius and had superior reflexes even by Coordinator standards.</span> and Lowe Guele used his new AI computer, 8, to get them to work. Ultimately, both the EA and ORB used Kira's handiwork to make all of their suits work, with Lowe also providing ORB with assistance behind the scenes.
<ul><li> The Earth Alliance didn't learn their lesson afterwards. Following the Battle of JOSH-A, they launched their first contingent of GAT-01 Strike Dagger units. Sadly, no one bothered to make sure they were properly shielded and all of them were wiped out when ZAFT fired its Gunginr EMP device. This was followed by the creation of the Forbidden Blue Mobile Suit, an aquatic variant of the dangerous Forbidden Gundam. It worked wonders, but the only thing protecting the pilot from the crushing depths of the ocean is the Trans-Phase Shift Armor and when that goes... The later Deep Forbidden fixed this by reinforcing the cockpit with titanium.
</li><li> The "Biological CPU" program started with the Boosted Men, also known as the Pre-Extendeds, comprised of Clotho Buer, Orga Sabnak, and Shani Andras, a trio of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">Psycho Prototype</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a> made to kill Coordinators in combat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">(and damn near capable of it, too)</a>. The problem? Their abilities came from brain surgery and massive amounts of combat drugs, making them mentally unstable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">violent</a>, and fatally addicted. They were required to be dosed on the drugs <em>twelve times a day</em> just to keep their central nervous systems from collapsing like jelly in a hot bath. By comparison, the later Extendeds were altered by mental conditioning, brainwashing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> and smaller doses of surgery and drugs. The net result was that while the Extendeds weren't <em>quite</em> as powerful in combat as the Boosted Men, they could at least fake normality and were less likely to have their neurons self-destruct in the middle of a mission.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamReconguistaInG">Gundam: Reconguista in G</a></em> has the G-Arcane, Ameria's attempt to make a Gundam unit out of incomplete blueprints. It's severely below spec compared to the G-Self, plus it's outfitted with anti-ship weaponry that's worse than useless in mobile suit combat because it can't hit fast-moving targets and it's so cumbersome that trying to aim gives enemy units time to knock it all over the place. Aida has a <em>lot</em> of trouble making it useful until she gets her hands on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a> and starts playing to the Arcane's actual abilities instead of trying to use it like a typical mobile suit. It's especially noteworthy when compared to the sleek, deadly G-Lucifer, which is what the Arcane is <em>supposed</em> to look like.
</li></ul></li><li> Suigintou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden">Rozen Maiden</a></em>, the first doll and main antagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of the first season, is short her torso. Her father never finished her, moving on to the next doll early, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">certain personality problems</a>.</span>
</li><li> The main girls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> are the first generation of cyborgs and thus exhibit certain flaws in their functioning, most notably the symptoms of conditioning poisoning that affect them all to varying degrees. The conditioning drugs used on the girls to heal them from injuries and keep them functional slowly destroy their minds over time. When the second generation of cyborgs is introduced, it's explicitly mentioned that they made the conditioning milder in the hopes that the new girls will be able to live longer.
<ul><li> Angelica is the best example, being the very first cyborg made. When the story opens, she is already so forgetful and frail that her ability to go on missions with the other girls is limited, and she's often forced to stay out of the action. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She eventually forgets almost everything from her life at the Agency, including her handler once she's near death.</span>
</li><li> Petra, the first cyborg of the second generation, shows this to a degree as well. Despite the milder conditioning, the Agency also instills in the new girls a firm sense that they can never disobey her handler. As a result of this, when Sandro orders Petra to insult him, Petra becomes dizzy and starts vomiting from the effort.
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> 3rd generation Byakkushiki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos">Infinite Stratos</a></em> counts as this since as stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Chifuyu</a> it has a very powerful weapon, but it doesn't have enough energy to sustain it. Not to mention so far that all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Ichika's</a> battles consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsVsSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsVsSwords">Guns vs. Swords</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, the prototype Me-262 Jet Striker from the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em>. Powerful, but too dangerous for most Witches to use safely.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, we have the first viable product of Project F, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fate Testarossa</span>. Although a viable clone, in that she had a healthy body and retained the memories of her original, she developed her own personality rather than the personality of her original (as well as minor issues like being right-handed when the original was left-handed), and so was considered a failure. In terms of magical ability, she was actually <em>superior</em> to the original, though. Later clones of the same technology do not have this issue, and appear to be perfect copies of the originals.
</li><li> HMX-12 Multi, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ToHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ToHeart">To Heart</a></em>, is an experimental maid robot who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl">not very good with any chores</a> given to her. Her successor HMX-13 Serio is superior in every way. (Mostly. Multi is able to express and understand a range of emotions while Serio cannot, which makes her popular with the few students she interacted with.)
</li><li> The <em>Grand Cross</em> (full designation Mobile Battleship Grand Cross) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BodaciousSpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BodaciousSpacePirates">Bodacious Space Pirates</a></em> may be an example of this. It is a fearsome foe, utilizing advanced technology beyond what is normally seen in the series, in particular a gravity control device that allows it to zig-zag and move as fast as a fighter. It also has large protective shields, powerful lasers, can unleash a deadly close-range <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> and has an edge in electronic warfare. However after significant displays of power, the ship completely powers down for a short period of time. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> its shields are not nearly as effective against physical bombardment as they are against beams</span>.
</li><li> The Gawain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, owing to its being filled with experimental, untested technologies. In specific, it's one of the first mecha in the series to possess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">Energy Weapons</a>, but their output is extremely finicky and the first couple of times it's used the blast is more like a completely random unfocused shotgun effect. After getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftPrototype">Grand Theft Prototype</a>-ed, Lelouch has it fixed up, turning the cannons into sweeping beams of death, but even then it's still slow as hell and fairly limited in armament; various smaller, faster Knightmare Frames (such as Cornelia's Gloucester and Jeremiah's Siegfried) are able to beat on it easily because of those qualities.
<ul><li> From a logistics standpoint the lancelot also counts due to its heavy energy consumption and a lack of an ejection seat for the pilot, its also mentioned that due its acceleration speed it needs a very cappable pilot with good reflexes to not crash with the built momentum.
</li></ul></li><li> The X-Aestivalis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> was this. An Aestivalis armed with a Gravity Blast Cannon normally reserved for capital ships, Urubitake deemed it a failure because it would destroy itself if it actually tried to charge the power needed to fire it... which it promptly does when a drug-crazed admiral takes it and attempts to fire on another ship with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> APTX 4869, the drug that de-aged Shinichi Kudo and Shiho Miyano and turned them into Conan Edogawa and Ai Haibara, was still incomplete even after Shiho took over as the developer.
</li><li> The antidotes against APTX 4869 are just prototypes and their effects roughly 24 hours, but frequent use right after the original dose drastically shortens the desired effect (in episode 522-523, the second pill worked only for rougly 4 hours). Also, taking the antidote consecutively will cause the body to develop resistance against it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, SMILES are an attempt to create artificial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Zoan-type</a> Devil Fruits that can be mass produced. To call them "flawed" is an understatement. 90% of all SMILES grant no powers, but afflict their consumer with two permanent curses; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a> that plague all Devil Fruit users, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingSmiliesPaintedOnYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingSmiliesPaintedOnYourSoul">an inability to express any emotion other than smiles and laughter</a>.

The rest got off pretty easy.
</li><li> A while back, Marvel established that Steve Rogers was actually the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>. Another more aggressive soldier, Pvt. Clinton McIntyre, was treated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a> the night before Steve received it. The general in charge did it because he didn't think the scrawny Steve Rogers was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> material. The soldier went insane since he wasn't treated with Vita-Rays like Steve. He was put in cold sleep until A.I.M. woke him up and cured him of his insanity decades later. As Protocide, he initially tried to kill Cap because he was brainwashed into believing that Captain America, supposedly his wartime partner, had betrayed him and left him for dead. Protocide eventually realizes that Cap is too good a person to have done that, and in his last appearance saves Steve's life before leaving for parts unknown.
<ul><li> The miniseries <em>Truth: Red, White &amp; Black</em> introduced Isaiah Bradley, the sole survivor of a battalion of black soldiers who were administered a recreated version of the Super-Soldier Serum. He only served in one major mission and was promptly imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth for decades for "desertion". It's unclear whether his current disabilities, similar to the symptoms of Alzheimer's and steroid abuse, are a result of an unstable super-soldier formula or his treatment at Leavenworth. The story reads like he is in fact the human guinea pig for Steve's serum, with the racist US Army spending many "more disposable" black lives before giving the serum to a white man, and this was originally the author's intention. However, Marvel backtracked, so the story begins in 1942 after Pearl Harbor while canonically Steve was already Cap by then, and this is acknowledged in-universe.

</li><li> It's probably easy to say that a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark's</a> armors fit into this category. His original armor was too bulky, nearly killing him when he was possessed by a voodoo practitioner, and another armor proved to be susceptible to control by Ultron. This is a result of his tendency to immediately attempt to use a new suit in the field as soon as he completes it, without bothering to properly test it first (In Tony's defence, this is mainly because most of his new suits are created to immediately stop whatever threat destroyed or damaged their predecessor, giving him very little time to test the suits before his foe causes more damage).

The armor he last fought in was the Mark VII. Just a few months later he was testing out Mark <em>42</em>. Most of the ones in-between were specialty armors with specific purposes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">such as an anti-Thor armor</a>. The Mark 42, nicknamed "Heartbreaker", was designed for rapid deployment. It was capable of breaking apart into several pieces which would fly out to reform around the user. The basic premise worked fine, but the key problem was that the armor would come apart <em>too</em> easily, not just when commanded to do so. The armor was also capable of remote control, but was even more fragile in that mode. Other problems included unstable power sources and inactive weapons and flight systems. When attacked by the bad guys, he was able to suit up just fine, but was forced to improvise projectiles while running tests on the armor's systems mid-battle. The same features were seen in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> armor but with all the kinks worked out.

Cosmetically, it came with entirely new nacelles, nacelle pylons and deflector dish. Internally, the ship was practically gutted and all the systems reworked. The result was a more modern ship, but it needed some work before being deployed on any mission. Its first jump to warp ended up creating an unstable wormhole, and an asteroid was drawn in with them. Because the engines were imbalanced, the phasers were automatically disabled, so they had to fire photon torpedoes instead. A lot of the problems they encountered were due to the fact that the ship was rushed out due to the threat of V'Ger approaching Earth, and thus its systems had to be tested on the fly.

<ul><li> In the new series, however, KARR can transform from a robot into a car, while KITT can only transform into various cars. Also, it is revealed that the military always intended to go with KARR, once KITT's AI was "mature" enough. KITT was a temporary necessity.

Once they work out the bugs, at great expense to themselves, they'll turn over the designs and the Russians can build effective copies at half the expense.

Lore initially claimed, and believed, that he was "too perfect" and that Data was created as an inferior model, though their creator later explained that they're perfectly equal and that the colonists weren't jealous of Lore's abilities, but terrified of his outbursts. It's later revealed that Data and Lore were the last and most successful of a string of prototype androids, with one of them, the childlike B-4, showing up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">Star Trek: Nemesis</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em>Enterprise</em>-D and the other <em>Galaxy</em>-class ships were designed in a period of relative peace for the Federation, and as such many of its features emphasized form over function (as detailed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/mrwong/wiki/index.php/Galaxy-class">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). Foremost was the saucer separation, a design present in many previous Starfleet ships but intended more for emergency evacuation. The Galaxy class boasted casual saucer separation, the intention was to evacuate non-Starfleet personnel into the saucer and let the stardrive section go into combat. The problem was that to make each section autonomous, fusion reactors in the saucer section worked in tandem with the warp core, making casual separation even less impractical and it's most valuable use remained in emergency evacuation (the later Prometheus design boasted triple separation and redundant warp cores and nacelles to take advantage of its combat use). Warp core ejection was also touted as a feature, but those systems rarely worked properly. It was also very uneconomic in internal space, trying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">to do just about everything</a>. The core design was still rugged and versatile, by the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Dominion War</a> the Galaxy class proved its worth as the backbone of Starfleet.

A mysterious cascading set of failures leads to the complete destruction of the USS <em>Yamato</em>. Picard worries that the <em>Enterprise</em>-D might have this mysterious, possibly inherent, flaw, but Geordi reassures him that, if it did, Starfleet wouldn't have pushed the ship out.

<ul><li> The <em>Defiant</em> could practically be a trope namer, having been famously described as "A set of guns strapped to an engine." Stuffing the equivalent abilities of a <em>Galaxy</em>-class ship into something barely a quarter of that size made it <em>extremely</em> overpowered, engine-wise, to the point where it nearly tore itself to pieces when it accelerated to full speed on its shakedown cruise. It was also, due to the combat-exclusive focus of its design, poorly suited for everything else (in stark contrast to every other Federation starship), with the worst of these shortcomings being the criminally under-equipped medical facilities.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3dgvq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3dgvq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3dgvq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Since it was meant to fight the Borg, the expectation was that either the Borg ship would be destroyed, in which case any injured could be treated on another ship, or the Federation fleet would be wiped out. Against a Borg invasion, there's no middle ground and no long-term sustained fighting.</span> It took the better part of a season and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFixIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFixIt">O'Brien</a> replacing just about everything to make the blasted machine work as it was expected to.
</li><li> Comes up again when Nog and Jake run into the elite cadet group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Red Squad</a>, who are piloting another <em>Defiant</em>-class vessel (which have been rushed into mass production despite still being prototypes due to the Dominion threat). It has the same problems, only they can't fix them. Luckily, Nog has spent enough time paying attention to O'Brien that he <em>does know</em>, and thus he makes the ship work in a few minutes. (The changes Nog makes are said to violate <em>many</em> Starfleet regulations, but they still work.)
</li><li> This also happens with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> <em>Defiant</em>, built by Smiley (nickname given by Mirror!Sisko to Mirror!O'Brien as a play on his first name and perpetually sour mood) based on the specs he stole from the prime universe's databanks. However, once built, they hit on the same technical difficulties as the original, forcing them to kidnap Sisko (who, having helped <em>design</em> the original, had a lot more in-depth knowledge of its workings and flaws than anyone in the Mirror Universe) and have him fix the problems. Surprisingly, Sisko is sympathetic and not only helps them fix the ship but also commands the battle against the Alliance's flagship (the Mirror version of the <em>Negh'Var</em>) and handily beats the massive warship, forcing Mirror!Worf to retreat.

Essentially, it made the ship's computer systems organic, theoretically improving processing speed and make it more resistant to disruptive environments. Several years in the Delta Quadrant showed just how impractical the idea was. From routine breakdowns, the ship <em>getting sick</em> and etc, the tech never took off.
</li><li> The NX-01 Enterprise from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> was a testbed for the first Warp 5 engine. In part due to how new humanity was to space travel it had a number of glitches, and being sent out ahead of schedule meant some features were not fully installed. They did manage to work out some kinks and along the way discover some successful workarounds (their phase cannons were very underpowered until they looped power through the warp core, using the hull's polarization field to vent off the kickback). The NX-02 Columbia launched with those features coming standard.
</li><li> The spore drive in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>. The system could be able to travel light years via a special mycelial network hidden "inside" the multiverse. Warp drive would be rendered useless as one could just pop in and out whenever they wanted to! However, Starfleet's computers weren't strong enough to handle the calculations, thus leading to the necessity of either a tardigrade-like creature or a genetically-enhanced human (the latter being a big no-no in Starfleet) to handle everything. Even then, there was the risk of warping somewhere they didn't want to (like near a star), hitting a technical "firewall" and killing everyone and possibly losing your navigator to the network. Starfleet wisely decommissioned the drive after the war with the Klingons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and classified it under threat of treason after the <em>Discovery</em> and its crew were thought lost.</span>

While it's under normal use, the suit works just fine with no issues. However, if the pilot attempts to push the mech beyond its normal limits, such as to shoot its weapons more often than normal, or overcharge it's main armament, divert all power to its force shield, or turn up its jet-pack thrusters to maximum, there's a risk of power overload, and injuring the pilot.

It was so infamous that the much more common successor dropped the name entirely, instead being called the <em>Mauler</em>.

It's all there.
</li><li> A running theme in <em>Battletech</em> history seems to be megalomaniacal dictators mandating the development of super-heavy war machines that end up being utter failures on a mechanical and practical level. The most notorious individual responsible for the most gigantic failures was Stefan Amaris, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">based on the obvious unsavory real life inspiration</a>. He had a thing for demanding giant, oversized 'Mechs and tanks that carried ludicrous amounts of armor and weaponry and yet had reliability issues so severe that most of them broke down just trying to move. The list includes the 140-ton <em>Burke II</em> super-heavy tank, the 110-ton <em>Matar</em> Battlemech, and the 90-ton <em>Rifleman III</em> Battlemech, among others&mdash;only the last of these was able to actually escape the kind of severe mechanical faults that plagued the rest of his ideas, and even then it was still little better than a bipedal gun turret due to its abysmal speed and mediocre armor. The <em>Matar</em> is a particularly bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a>, as its knees, ankles, and hips basically exploded from the weight stress the first time it tried to move.
</li><li> The Binary Laser Cannon, or Blazer. Created during the Succession Wars after the Inner Sphere had nuked itself back a few centuries in terms of technological production ability by effectively taking a pair of large lasers apart and putting both beam emitters into the same housing (hence the name), it turned out to be a horrific heat hog that was simply not effective enough for it to ever get put into production on a mech. Despite numerous attempts by the Great Houses to figure out an effective use for it through the 31st Century, it was ultimately regarded as a failure when compared to other energy weapons of similar size like the Heavy PPC, which offers better damage for similar heat, and the Large Variable Speed Pulse Laser, which is more accurate and heat efficient.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hyper-Velocity Autocannon, or HVAC. Created as an attempt to make autocannons with better range, they succeeded but were riddled with flaws. First of all, the guns are heavier than standard autocannons of the same type. Second of all, the propellant used produces huge clouds of smoke that block line of sight of anything that might be behind the unit firing it (such as allies who wish to shoot the same target). Third, they generate a lot of heat and have reduced ammo compared to normal autocannons. Fourth, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">prone to violent malfunction</a>. All in all, there are other weapons, such as Gauss Riles, that offer similar range with better punch, far less heat, and none of the other flaws. As a consequence, they were only used on a few prototype designs before being abandoned.

And why when a company releases an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a>, it's very easy to tell.
</li><li> Blues / Proto Man / DLN-000, Mega Man's "older brother" in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man (Classic)</a></em> series, is certainly a badass in his own right, but there's something preventing him from being a proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a>: his flawed atomic power reactor made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Wily</a> and a defect in his energy system later acquired according to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agxbVG64mSo">his solo ending<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em>Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters</em>. He was originally equipped with a flawed solar power reactor, which Dr. Light developed and tried to fix. However, because Blues was developed with a strong sense of independence, he ran away from Light Labs because he feared that fixing his solar power reactor would erase his individuality. Eventually, the flawed solar reactor stopped working and Blues in turn ceased to function. It was then that Dr. Wily found him and tried to fix him, by switching his old reactor with an early version of the atomic power reactors, which all Wilybots would later use. Besides giving Proto Man a new power reactor, he was outfitted with combat capabilities and his trademark visor along with his shield. However, combat pushes Proto Man's atomic power reactor to its limits; overuse will make him a living time bomb, as one well placed shot can cause him to blow up and annihilate the environment around him. The defect his energy system later acquired causes him pain and if the defect is left unchecked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">his body may eventually will break down</a>. Since he has a strong sense of independence, he refuses to let himself be repaired by Dr. Light, even if it means his death. In games where Proto Man's playable, he's typically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> due to the defect mentioned above.
<ul><li> Bizarrely, Dr. Light rebuilds Proto Man during the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManAndBass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManAndBass">Mega Man &amp; Bass</a></em>, where he should have been able to give him a more advanced power reactor and fix the defect his energy system acquired, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em> are explicitly <em>after</em> that game and have the double damage thing.

Proto Man doesn't have a flawed or limited power core, but his energy systems are messed up, because Dr. Light tried to install a buggy version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLawsCompliant">the three laws</a> in order to control him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">No wonder</a> he's paranoid about Dr. Light taking his free will away, if given the opportunity and won't let Dr. Light 'fix' him: Proto Man is dying because Dr. Light already tried to do that. On top of the fact he can't trust Dr. Light, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">it's possible that the power system programming flaw can't be fixed without fixing the three laws programming</a>, in which case he really would lose his individuality, if he was fixed.

The Earthen were more stable, and though the same curse eventually turned them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">Dwarves</a>, they skipped the whole "degenerate subterranean savages" phase.
</li><li> Both the Alt Eisen and Weiss Ritter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">Super Robot Wars Original Generation</a></em> were designed as next-generation prototypes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> to consider for mass production. The Weiss Ritter was rejected simply for being too expensive for the time, but the Alt Eisen was rejected because it was practically impossible to pilot due to its high weight, poor balance, and excessive reliance on short-range weaponry. The one man they found who could actually pilot the Alt Eisen did so by leaning into its flaws rather than trying to work against them: when it came time to upgrade the machine, he equipped it with the even <em>more</em> flawed prototypes of its main weapons that had been discarded during development because they exaggerated both its strengths and its flaws even more.
<ul><li> The original Huckebein in the same series was designed using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Black Hole Engine</a> derived from alien technology, and the first prototype destroyed the entire lab it was in upon starting up. In this case, however, the flaw was <em>deliberate</em>: if humanity had noticed the flaw and corrected it, it would have indicated to the aliens who provided the plans that they were dangerous enough to warrant an immediate invasion. The scientist who noticed the flaw realized it was a trap and deliberately built the engine with the flaw intact so that Earth would have more time to prepare.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGaiden">Masou Kishin</a></em> games, the Jaohm is one of the first Masouki ever developed in the Masouki Project. Unfortunately, engineers hit a construction roadblock regarding how to effectively mold Orichalconium alloy. As result, the Jaohm's armor is mixed with ceramic, making it heavier and not as tough as they had wanted. In fact, despite the Jaohm supposedly designated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> like all other wind-based Masouki, the weight of the ceramic armor forces it be slow.

The process worked, but also drove him completely insane.

The prototypes for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">standard Big Daddy</a>, the Alpha Series are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">also use Plasmids</a>.

</li><li> E-101 Beta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">as the name indicates</a>, a beta test of Eggman's E-series robots. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">He's beaten easily</a>, causing Eggman to rebuild him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a>.

<ul><li> The Biolizard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> is a prototype of the ultimate life form. Shadow is the perfected ultimate life form. The former is a giant lizard covered with gills that has to hyperventilate through its (equally huge) life support system frequently in order to survive. The latter is an anthropomorphic hedgehog who doesn't seem to have any form of machine hooked up to him, save for the rocket skates and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiters</a> on his wrists, and he can lose those without any shown ill effect. Oh, and Shadow takes on his prototype and wins.

</li><li> Genesis, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> suffers from degeneration from his indirect prenatal exposure to Jenova cells as one of the subjects of Project G. His desperate attempts to fix this problem bring tragedy to the setting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> has its fair share of flawed prototypes.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> has the Metal Gear REX, which is a powerful nuclear-equipped walking tank with one fatal flaw: because the cockpit is completely sealed off from the outside, it is reliant on a shoulder-mounted radome to see. If the radome is damaged, the cockpit is designed to automatically open, exposing the pilot to danger. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Otacon intentionally designed this flaw into REX, under the belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">every mecha needs some kind of weakness</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Metal Gear <em>Sahalanthropus</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that is distinctly humanoid in design. To adequately use such a build, <em>Sahalanthropus</em> was designed to use an advanced artificial intelligence. Controlling it with AI alone, however, resulted in poor performance, so it was redesigned to use a human pilot in conjunction with the AI. This, however, created more difficulties: in spite of downsizing the AI core as much as possible without sacrificing performance, creating a cockpit to accommodate an adult pilot made it too top-heavy to be practical. The size of the cockpit only permits those of particular short stature to control it, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">children</a>. Furthermore, the back-mounted railgun can only be fired while <em>Sahalanthropus</em> is in its hunched-over "tank" configuration: attempting to fire the railgun while upright would cause it to topple over from the recoil.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The first power-armor model from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series allowed soldiers to become one-man tanks, but issues with power supply made mobility difficult, meaning that soldiers were stationed somewhere, hooked up to a generator, and left to kill as many Chinese as possible.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel">Fallout Tactics</a></em> has a prototype Pulse Rifle that deals less damage and has a lower ammo capacity than the mass-produced version.
</li><li> You can find an intact prototype Sentrybot in a junk yard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>. Should you choose to activate it, it immediately becomes apparent why it was junked: it overheats rapidly, making it far less dangerous than the standard Sentrybots you can find throughout the Commonwealth and (should you choose to hack it) useful only for soaking enemy bullets in combat.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a possibility with the prototype feature in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a> II: The Lords of Winter</em>. The first ship of any new design takes longer to build and requires more resources. It also has a random chance of being either better or worse at certain things than the following ships of the same design, as evidenced by the prototype's nickname.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChroniclesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChroniclesII">Valkyria Chronicles II</a></em>: The V0 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>. While it's extremely powerful, it destroyed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leon Hardins</span>, reducing him into a shadow of his former self, who people then know as Dirk Gassenarl. Attempts to create Artifical Valkyria power generally result in this trope.
</li><li> Very tragic example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonAndTheUnwoundFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonAndTheUnwoundFuture">Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</a></em>. Two aspiring scientists actually managed to construct a prototype time machine. One of them noticed a flaw in its design and tried to postpone the first test. This was in vain, as the other made a deal with a wealthy company for the power source, and wanted to demonstrate its viability as soon as possible. The result? <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">BOOM</a>.</strong></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The greedy scientist miraculously survived, and used the money from the deal to cover up the explosion and become Prime Minister of Britain. The explosion took out a neighboring block of flats, and killed the test subject... but the time machine temporarily sent her ten years forward in time, then dragged her back to the time of the explosion.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Drone technology: introduced in the first game, the drone frigate is devastating against fighters but carries no weapons aside the drones, can barely scratch enemy capital ships, and the drones are stationary around the frigate (making them easy targets for frigates and bigger ships). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Advanced Drone Frigate</a> of <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em> is a superior design. It carries its own weapons to attack enemy ships and defend itself and has a smaller number of superior <em>Swarmer</em>-class drones, able to maneuver on their own at medium distance from the frigate. The technology disappears in the third game.
</li><li> Ion cannons (apart the Bentusi ones, at least): they are big and cumbersome, and frigates can only mount one of them (and nothing else) in a spinal mount, making them capable ship killers at the price of being harmless against fighters and corvettes. In the first game we are treated to two solutions: The Bentusi ion cannons don't need recharge time and can track small craft, and can be mounted on <em>fighters</em>). The Kadeshi ion frigate, which you can't build but can capture, mounts <em>four</em> of them, increasing their firepower and giving them limited anti-fighter capabilities. Destroyers and heavy cruisers, being much bigger than frigates, can mount them in turrets. The real solution, however, comes in <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">multi-beam frigate</a>, which has five ion cannon turrets. Each individual turret is less powerful than the single gun of an ion frigate, but when all fired at a single target they are devastating, and enemy strike craft are in for a nightmare. This time the technology remains but with modifications: the ion platform has four small ion cannons on twin turrets and can hit both strike craft and capital ships. The ion frigate returns to the single weapon in spinal mount, but outguns the ion platform by a decent margin, and the battlecruiser has four ion cannons in twin turrets, each cannon outgunning the frigate.
</li><li> Strike craft engines: In the first game they needed periodical refueling, which was the one weakness of the Kadeshi swarmers; they outperform <em>scouts</em> and have corvette-level firepower, with advanced swarmers being faster, better armoured and having twice the firepower, but the swarmers need to be refuelled every minute or so. In <em>Cataclysm</em> and <em>Homeworld 2</em> strike craft don't need refueling anymore.
</li><li> Shield technology: In the original game the shield technology could only block projectiles and missiles, while mines and energy weapons passed through it at will. In <em>Cataclysm</em> they are upgraded to protect from everything, and in <em>Homeworld 2</em> they are upgraded to protect even from radiation clouds. Also, the original <em>Tiifal</em> defense field frigate was unarmed, but the Sentinels (ships smaller than fighters) of <em>Cataclysm</em> and the Hiigaran defense field frigate of <em>Homeworld 2</em> both carry limited weapons.
</li><li> Capital ships point defense: In the original game capital ships tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">Point Defenseless</a> due their weapons being designed to take down capital ships (only the drone frigate, the carriers and the motherships can truly deal with fighters, and are awfully vulnerable to capital ships). <em>Cataclysm</em> gives us the already-mentioned multi-beam frigate and three types of super capital ships capable of defending themselves from fighters (the Beast heavy cruiser has a beam weapon to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">subvert them</a>, the Somtaaw destroyer is equipped with a missile battery, and the Somtaaw dreadnought comes with a missile battery and fast-tracking ion cannons, and is later upgraded with a repulsor weapon to disperse enemy fighters). <em>Homeworld 2</em> has various frigates made to deal with enemy strike craft, and destroyers and battlecruisers have actual point defense weapons.
</li><li> The mothership itself: In the first game, the mothership (both the Kushan and the Taiidan variant) is lightly armed and armored and (in the single player campaign) can't move in real space due to its engines being unfinished. This is a complication in some missions, such as the one where the mothership is endangered by asteroids and the one where the enemy tries a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> on it. To rub salt in the wound, we see that the Kadeshi mothership has ion cannons and very fast engines, in addition to building capabilities and point defense weapons. In <em>Cataclysm</em>, your mothership comes with working engines and capable weapons, and over the course of the game you upgrade it with superior armour, energy cannons and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, while the Beast mothership has comparable normal weapons, slightly slower engines and inferior construction capacity, but it has superior armour and swaps the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> with a beam to spread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a>. In <em>Homeworld 2</em>, the <em>Pride of Hiigara</em> (itself an improved version of the Kushan mothership) has working engines, decent weapons, and can be upgraded with various systems, including cloak generators and sensors to defeat it.
</li></ul></li><li> L2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">biotics</a> are this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> universe. It was a biotic amp implant design that was made when humanity still didn't fully understand what it was doing when it came to biotics. Many L2 biotics are plagued by various health problems; the ones that get migraines are the lucky ones. L3 designs and later are more refined and don't have those problems, but L2 implants are also difficult to upgrade, leaving many L2s unwilling to take the risk. Furthermore, few L3s were as powerful as the L2s, with Commander Shepard being an explicit exception, so some opted not to take the upgrades, because they'd lose out. There is also the fact that the retrofit surgery would be performed by an offshoot of the now-defunct Conatix Industries, which many L2s intensely distrust due to Conatix's actions in the early days of researching human biotics. It isn't until the L4 biotics are developed that human biotics begin to overcome both of those problems (L2's medical issues and L3's weaker power compared to L2s).
<ul><li> Warlord Okeer created Grunt to be the perfect Krogan. The other tank-grown krogan you fight to reach Okeer are his failed attempts, discarded because they failed to meet his expectations. (Though if called on it, he actually notes that they're more than capable of doing what they were commissioned for - the Blue Suns leader who ordered them is just really <em>awful</em> at leading, and Okeer has some ludicrously high standards.)
</li><li> In the first game, you meet an admiral who is rather cynical about the <em>Normandy</em> and tries to pass the ship off as this, citing issues such as the oversized drive core, the expensive price it took to build, and the odd bridge layout. Of course, you can shut him down by explaining each issue; the oversized drive core gives the <em>Normandy</em> almost unheard-of power for a ship of her size, the price is well worth the cost due to also being one of the fastest and stealthiest ships in the galaxy, and the layout of the bridge is a turian design, helping punctuate that the ship and her mission is a multispecies effort and a shining example of Human&#150;Turian relations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em>, there's the Kett Behemoth, their attempt at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">exalting</a> a krogan.

Unlike the later models, she and the others were largely lacking in actual individuality and when she did finally develop she was unstable. She was technically a success, but viewed as too dangerous to use and sealed away.
<ul><li> Granted this may have been a problem with the development method, not the technology itself. The scientists seemed to think the best way to get the robots to develop a personality was to have them repeatedly fight to the death, and after they did develop a personality the scientists immediately tried to seal them away so they could be used as weapons. They were trying to get them to develop Personas, which are tied to the user's mind and emotions, without letting them develop <em>healthy</em> minds and emotions.

These prototypes are early ancient weapon designs from before that planet's cataclysm. When you find them, you only need the appropriate materials to manufacture them rather than having to research an entire research branch. The problem is that these prototypes are extremely weak compared to the weapons you can manufacture through researching. Many times the prototypes lack the extra bonuses and have far weaker stats than their researched counterparts and often use more material. For example one titanium bow prototype is a Tier 2 weapon that uses 6 titanium to manufacture and only does +4 damage. The lesser Tier 1 titanium weapon that you researched only takes 4 titanium, does +6 damage and has a +5 chance of doing a critical hit.

<ul><li> The UNSC's earliest attempt at developing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> was the ORION Project, but the program as a whole was so underwhelming they decided to start over from scratch. The head of the following super soldier program, Dr. Halsey, felt that ORION still gave them fundamental insights into where to proceed, and thus named her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> program SPARTAN-<em>II</em>, retroactively making Orion candidates Spartan-Is.
</li><li> The Spartan-IIs were extremely powerful, but their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> included biological enhancements and experimental surgeries so extreme that <em>half</em> their original recruits died just from the procedures, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> was some of the most expensive technology ever produced by the UNSC. The SPARTAN-III Program was designed to address the heavily restrictive standards, high expenses, and long development cycle of the IIs, doing so by broadening the requirements for age, genetics and personality profiles, and opting for cheaper semi-powered armor. Combined with the less extreme surgeries and improved medical technology allowing everyone to survive the augmentation process, the IIIs were significantly more numerous than the IIs, though somewhat less skilled individually and significantly less well-equipped. The Spartan-IVs, developed after the Human-Covenant War, are a fusion of all the previous programs, being adult volunteers who recieved significantly improved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, but somewhat less extensive augmentations compared to their predecessors.

It worked well enough in traditional warfare, but against the Locust their skin was too thick and the blades often broke.

Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">in actual gameplay,</a> the Retro Lancer is considered the better weapon by players, due to combining the range of the Lancer with better stopping power and the ability to counter the ubiquitous Gnasher shotgun.

He doesn't have all of Superman's powers (no flight or heat vision), but he's sane.

While Earl has every single power held by Rusty, and a superior targeting ability, Earl has a failed, stunted A.I. As such, while not fully evil, Earl is little more than a little, stereotypical toy soldier, programming to follow unflinchingly orders issued by an authority figure. Failing that, Earl is surly, unwilling to compromise by giving in teamwork and inclined to snarl and lash against his own allies. Perhaps worst of all, his A.I. was so simple that he cannot process an order in anything but the most literal of terms. A command to "go stand in the corner" in a round room is enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> him so badly that he sputters out and completely resets himself.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder13" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> When doing or making <em>anything</em> for the first time, it generally takes a few tries or some time to work out the kinks and bugs and what-not.
<ul><li> So usually that &mdash; the first phonograph record worked right the first time. Edison's reaction? "I was always afraid of things that worked the first time."
</li></ul></li><li> The first British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">tanks</a> weren't just slower, less armored, less reliable, and less lethal than modern ones &mdash; the crew was housed in the hull along with the engine and lacked proper ventilation. It could be so hot inside (a common figure being up to 50&deg;C) that numerous tank operations ended prematurely because its crew was too sick to continue, or even rendered unconscious. Fuel was also housed internally, making any ignition of it a death sentence for the crew. Even rounds that failed to pierce the tank's armor was liable to be knocked around into gaps in the armour and put shrapnel inside, forcing crews to be equipped with protective leather-and-mail masks to protect their faces.
</li><li> Car technology:
<ul><li> Electric cars. First discussed, and some designs built decades ago. In fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">electric cars have been around since the late 19th century</a>, but the internal combustion engine offered superior performance while taking up less space than the early batteries, and thus it was most of a century before serious thought was even given to trying again. Years later, the technology is still largely considered in the early "feasible" state due to the push for eco-friendly Green Tech cars. Note the quotation marks around "feasible". To make an all-electric vehicle requires bulky, and heavy, Lithium Ion battery packs, which in turn often takes five to ten hours or more to fully charge, often require specialized power outlets or plugs, and have very limited range before needing to recharge compared to traditional gasoline- or diesel-fueled cars. Add on the fact that there is a very likely chance the power being supplied to recharge the batteries comes from a not so eco-friendly power plant or generator source, the batteries themselves currently have a limited life-span (approximately five years) and are incredibly expensive to replace, essentially ruining the whole point of an electric-powered car.
<ul><li> Hybrids however, have been more successful due to mixing electric with traditionally fueled cars, often using the car's normal operations to charge the electrics, extending fuel economy, and kicking in the engine only when extra power is needed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Prototype airplanes are often this. A fair job description of the test pilot is, "person who straps into a potentially fatally flawed airplane and tries their best to make it kill them."
<ul><li> A relatively mild case of this was the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">F-15 Eagle</a>. The prototype airframe had square-tipped wings and a conventional horizontal stabilizer. The first flight revealed unacceptable levels of buffet on both, making McDonnell-Douglas modify the former by clipping the wingtips and the latter by adding a dogtooth to the stabilizer, giving the F-15 its two most distinctive features.
</li></ul></li><li> The first trains to reach the then "unheard of" speed of 300 km/h encountered a problem called "hunting oscillation," which essentially means the wheels swayed dangerously due to small imperfections the engineers at the time did not even know existed. With 21st-century technology, such problems can be simulated on a computer and eliminated in the planning stage, and trains doing 320 km/h in revenue runs are called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">Tuesday</a> in France or Japan. However, the experience (or lack thereof) with early prototypes made a World Bank credit to Japan for what would ultimately become the Shinkansen conditional on the top speed being lowered to 210 km/h.
</li><li> The earliest German submarines paled in comparison to their successors. They emitted clouds of smoke and took nearly ten minutes to dive. Of course, the Germans being the tech masters they are, they were quick to refine their designs.
<ul><li> The <em>H. L. Hunley</em>, the first submarine to sink another ship in combat, was made by the Confederacy in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a>. The original crew died on a test run when it sank. It was salvaged, and the second crew (along with its designer) died similarly on another test run. Its third crew is believed to have been sunk and killed because it was too close to the torpedo explosion that sank its Union target.
</li><li> The <em>K-Class</em> submarines of the British Royal Navy were built during the First World War and used steam turbines, which allowed them to travel at impressive speeds for a submarine, being designed to screen ahead of British fleets and attack the flanks of enemy fleets. They were very problematic and accident-prone, however, and steam engines in submarines would not gain favor again until the advent of nuclear submarines during the Cold War.
</li></ul></li><li> James "The Hacksmith" Hobson built a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> in his garage. It lacked the ability to <em>turn properly</em> until Universal joints were placed into the hip assemblies.
<ul><li> Similarly, his <em>Flying like Iron Man</em> prototypes are pretty lacklustre, requiring a StuntWire rig to get off the ground.
</li></ul></li><li> During the making of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, the first model made of the <em>Enterprise</em>-D was a six-foot behemoth that could only be filmed while lying on its back because its saucer section was so ridiculously top-heavy. (Ever wondered why there were so many shots filmed of its underside? That's why.) It also made using the saucer separation feature impractical <em>because</em> of it. This was because Industrial Light &amp; Magic was busy at the time they needed the model build, and when they found the time, they were given <em>that</em>. They later made a four-foot model which improved the balance and allowed shots from the top.
