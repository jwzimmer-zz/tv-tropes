So, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">that character that nobody likes</a> is finally going to be killed off! This is the moment you thought you'd be rejoicing. Yet... the death scene is so well done that you actually find yourself feeling sad or so brutal that you find yourself horrified! Expect to read a lot of messageboard posts saying "I never thought I'd cry at X's death, but I was bawling so loud I woke the neighbors."

In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobileSuitGundamHathawaysFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobileSuitGundamHathawaysFlash">Hathaway's Flash</a></em>, he joins a terror organization called Mafty, becomes their leader, and smashes stuff up in his badass Xi Gundam. In the end he was captured and executed on orders <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">from his own father</a></em>, Bright Noah (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">who apparently didn't know his son was the terrorist until after he had signed the death warrant</a>) which had... let's just say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">a devastating effect on him</a>. You'd have to be <em>heartless</em> to not feel at least a bit sorry for <em>the whole Noah family</em> after this. Yes, including Hathaway himself.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobileSuitGundamHathawaysFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobileSuitGundamHathawaysFlash">Hathaway's Flash</a></em> plays off of the <em>Char's Counterattack</em> novelization "Beltorchika's Children" rather than the anime movie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01vwa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note01vwa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01vwa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The main difference being that in the novel, Hathaway kills Quess; in the movie, Hathaway goes nuts and kills Chan after she kills Quess</span>. And just to twist the knife further, after his death, Hathaway speaks to Quess's spirit, and she says she never loved him. So he fought and died for nothing. That's just cruel.
</li><li> On that subject of Chan, she had some unpopularity for taking the place of Beltorchika, but Hathaway's aforementioned murder of her after she was forced to kill Quess in self-defense was something even her most ardent haters were horrified at.
</li></ul></li><li> For some, Ginias Sahalin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team</a></em>. It REALLY depends on who you're talking to, however.
</li></ul></li><li> Yanagi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> is not well liked and his misogynistic ways and even trying to <em>rape</em> one of the girls makes it very easy to hate him. But not only does he redeem himself by dying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, giving him the dignity that he actually possesses, but one cannot help but feel terrible for him because an insect stung him and laid its egg within him, making him a breeding ground for its young... and their hatching is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">unpleasant</a>.
</li><li> The death of Hinaichigo in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden">Rozen Maiden</a></em>. There was a whole episode dedicated to her winding down to her eventual 'death' where she spent the day with her old owner, complete with stuttered movement and speech during her last moments.
<ul><li> Her death in the manga, however, was still horrifying: Kirakishou used her rose vines to destroy and consume her from the inside out. Still sad.
</li></ul></li><li> Mikaila's death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain">Count Cain</a>: God Child</em> qualifies. Also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a>.
<ul><li> A case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>, considering she got nothing close to a healthy upbringing. All she ever was encouraged to do was "obsess over Cain" and look pretty.
</li></ul></li><li> Shirley Fennette in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveEverygirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveEverygirl">"Whiny", "stupid"</a>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">powerless</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">in love with the main character</a>", she quickly earned her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappydom</a> in the first season. Yet the reaction from the fanbase following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">her heartwrenching and VERY well-done death scene</a> in the second was one of sheer and absolute <em>outrage</em> towards her murderer. Who would have thought? Some are probably relieved that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">this didn't happen again</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> version.
<ul><li> And later? The murderer, Rolo, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vrhIyYrJ4k">died too<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>... and lots of fans mourned him instead of cheering because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed his life for Lelouch</a>, even after Lelouch confessed his hatred toward Rolo, as the first and last thing he truly did of his own will. <em>Lelouch himself</em> ended up mourning him when all was said and done, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetThemDieHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetThemDieHappy">letting him believe he was lying about what he said about him</a> (since he really did take back parts of it).
</li></ul></li><li> Makoto Isshki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon">RahXephon</a></em> is an unlikeable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> when first introduced and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">sinks to new lows</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">as the series progresses</a>. Only until the mid point of the series do we see his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">heart-wrenching</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">upbringing</a>. During the last episode, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">undignified mental breakdown</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">unceremonious death</a> come like a slap in the face when his best friend tearfully runs to his side, to hear his last words.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kira Supporter Kiyomi Takada ends up getting kidnapped by Mello as a part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to reveal Light as Kira. She's stripped naked by him and then kills him with a death note scrap she hid in her bra. Genuinely frightened and trapped inside a truck, she wraps herself in a bedsheet and then takes his phone and calls Light, asking him to come rescue her. Instead, he writes her name in the Death Note so that she commits suicide by setting herself on fire, by far his coldest and most heartless kill.
</li><li> Misa's Scrappyhood, and her ending, which got past many people. In the close credits, she mirrors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">in dress</a> and demeanor an earlier scene when she sings about her trust and devotion to Light. She follows the same route, ending at a veranda where she sadly and wistfully looks off into the sky, only this time she's standing <em>outside</em> the railing...
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few viewers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> did not like Asuka very much at all and spent most of the series wishing bad things on the character. Then she was horrendously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">mind raped</a>, revealing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">tragic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, fired from the Eva project, disappeared, and was found later as a suicidal broken mess laying in a bathtub in a ruined building. And that's just in the original series.
<ul><li> In <em>End of Evangelion</em>, she's still in a coma and Shinji comes to her hospital room and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">wanks</a> over her in that state. Then she comes back into action after realizing her mother's soul is in her Eva, protecting her. She defeats nine Mass Produced Evas, each with the best weapon of the series and unlimited power, only to have her Eva stabbed in the eye, utterly mangled, eaten alive, and its organs ripped out. She somehow survives and makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">one last attempt</a> to fight back. She fails, and dies by being impaled about 12 times. This tended to make the fans more sympathetic. She felt all of this happen because of the neural link. At the very least, she somehow comes back to life in the epilogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe">mostly unharmed</a>. But considering the fact that the first thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Shinji</a> does after waking up with her the only other human currently left is making an attempt to choke her to death, followed by her exclaiming sickness (which, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant">Tiffany Grant</a> was morning sickness, has... interesting implications)... oh, and let us not forget that the reason she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageBabe">Bandage Babe</a> at the end is due to the injuries her Evangelion suffered (again, which she felt through the neural link) - in particular, her eye is covered up &mdash; and the last thing anyone saw of her (and, for the record, the thing that finished setting Shinji off) was her Evangelion being eaten by the MP Evas...
<ul><li> It should also be noted that due to her high sync rate at the time, she didn't merely <em>feel</em> the pain, the damage <em>transfers to her own body</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> Tousen earned a great deal of dislike during his fight with Kenpachi; he removes Kenpachi's senses then lectures a deaf, defenseless Kenpachi toying with him instead of ending it. It gives Kenpachi a chance to adapt and turn the tables. Once his motives for siding with Aizen against Soul Society came out, the dislike worsened. He is motivated by a desire for peace and a decision to find the path of least bloodshed towards achieving that peace... by supporting a man that incites civil war within Soul Society and who follows up that civil war with a war between Shinigami and Hollows. His reasoning is therefore viewed as stupid and hypocritical by fans and was cemented further when the first thing he did upon regaining his sight was insult his oldest and most noble friend, Komamura. However, when he's thoroughly defeated, barely able to talk and finally confronted by Hisagi and Komamura, he admits that he was in the wrong. The trio start to have a surprisingly tender reconciliation... and Tousen blows up in the middle of it, leaving Komamura screaming at Aizen for revenge and the fans feeling sorrier for Tousen than they had expected to.

<ul><li> Made worse by the fact that he never could bring him self to actually drink blood from a person.
</li><li> Also, Megumi, who had been an unsympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> through most of the series, gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a> in the midst of finally remembering her humanity and dreams and having a psychotic break as a result.

It's also sad when realizing with Fridge Tearjerker that because Mamoru dies by Galaxia's hands, the last piece of Chibi-Usa we see is the remains of Usagi's memory/dream before everyone around her in the dream near the episode is gone.

However, many felt bad when he was killed by Yoshikage Kira in a futile attempt to contact and warn Josuke and Okuyasu.

However, just before her death we see her crying and alone, having killed off her devoted boyfriend Izayoi because she was that paranoid and terrified he'd somehow betray her and activate her NG code, which would kill her, she clearly feels terrible about this as she makes pitiful attempts to construct a barrier to keep herself safe, repeating to herself she'll make new friends once she gets out. Then the next episode shows her utter mangled, <em>brutalised</em> corpse. And as if that wasn't bad enough, it's revealed the victim is brainwashed into suicide, meaning Ruruka felt so awful about her actions she repeatedly mutilated herself and choked herself with her own candy until she died out of guilt. Selfish or not, she got one of the most fucked-up deaths in the anime and a lot of fans eased up on her after that.

<ul><li> Although Sylvia Ikaruga Misurugi doesn't die by the end of the series, a lot of viewers felt sorry for her when it turns out that she also witnessed the deaths of her parents, was tricked by Liza and Julio into hurting Ange, and eventually regretting her actions in crossing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> with her biological sister to the point that she'll never see the latter again.

He didn&#146;t do much besides kill people enthusiastically without mercy, but in his final battle with Kurapica he is tied up and tortured but doesn&#146;t reveal information about his friends. As Kurapica hits him, Uvogin keeps saying &#147;kill me&#148; in a tone that indicates he knows he isn&#146;t leaving alive. After Kurapica puts a curse on Uvogin in which he must tell the truth Uvogin still refuses to say anything about his allies. This is when Uvogin dies and most people who were waiting for him to die agree this was way more sad than satisfying.

</li><li> Steel, who died at the same time, is less remembered. Perhaps what made Vibe's death stand out more was the fact that the skinny jerk for the first time in thirty issues suddenly showed a glimmer of true heroism. A desire to help others because it's the right thing to do. A sudden desire to be a better man. Even the dullest stone sparkles a little, if polished right. It's something J.M. De Matteis is very good at... finding the inner light in <em>any</em> character, no matter how rotten. Then, just to twist the knife, Vibe's murdered within moments of his epiphany! He learned his lesson... but died anyway, alone. The end! Powerful, powerful stuff. On the other hand, the only thing most people can remember about Steel's issue is the nightmarish panel where he cries out "Help-Me-Help-Me-Help-Me-Help-Me" after being shattered.

But thanks to that iconic story and its powerful images, Gwen overnight became a comics' icon and martyr of the Silver Age, with the brutality of her death so shocking and upsetting that it caused the first major backlash and divide among Spider-Man fans.

He might have gotten away after being seen if he hadn't been distracted by the sight of a lab where really rather gruesome experiments were being performed on nonhuman species - he went in and freed a subject, and was killed.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>:
<ul><li> Season 3, Ryan Chapelle. He shows up in 23 episodes across the first three seasons, and in 20 of them he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> <em>and</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a>. He softens up in the 21st, just in time to find out he has to die (the 23rd is just his body being recovered by the villains). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> made a deal that the heroes needed, and one of the conditions was that Chapelle be executed. Suddenly he becomes incredibly sympathetic and human. Chapelle is a particularly great case because Jack asks if there's anyone he wants to contact before he dies. Chapelle says no, his only friends are at <em>work</em>. Considering that we've only seen him at work where he seems to be something of an in-universe Scrappy... ouch.
</li><li> Lynn McGill in Season 5. Starts out as a douche, but after his sister is killed, he has a change of heart, and you can't help but feel sad for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> (the fact that he's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">Samwise Gamgee</a> doesn't hurt).
</li><li> In Season 1, Janet York is killed by a man pretending to be her father. That episode is when <em>24</em>, a show that had been somewhat motoring along to that point, became seriously good.
</li><li> The evil, vain, manipulative Sherry Palmer, who died in Season 3.
</li><li> George Mason in Season 2. If not to viewers, certainly to the characters on the show.
</li><li> Dina Araz. She wasn't that thrilling a villain and later very reluctant ally to Jack Bauer, and most of her arc in the first half of Day 4 took up way to much time that took away from the more interesting character in the season. But geez the way she goes out is a downer.
</li><li> Dana Walsh. When she was introduced fans weren't happy with her lackluster arc about her former boyfriend trying to blackmail her. Then it was revealed she was working with the villains and opinions about her character improved a bit, but with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> at best. But then her final episode came in where she was executed in cold blood by Jack Bauer even with her begging for her life. Not only did just about everyone feel sympathy after that, it demonstrated just how far Jack had lost it on his quest for revenge in one of the very rare killings he's made where we <em>weren't</em> supposed to be rooting for him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter">Agent Carter</a></em> nobody liked misogynist jerk Roger Dooley... but when he jumped out of a window in an explosive vest due to "Ivchenko's" machinations, a lot of fans felt like jerk or not, he didn't deserve this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>: After four seasons of criticism, Laurel Lance was killed off in a way so insulting (immobilized, stabbed with an arrow, spent her last words propping her ex-boyfriends new relationship while admitting she still loved him and then unceremoniously flatlining) that even her detractors contributed to the backlash. It helped that the back half of Season 4 hadn't given her any of her own storylines - which had been infamously melodramatic - and put her in the background with nothing to do but be a big sister/adviser for the rest of team, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">which had made her a lot more popular</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cally. She had her fans, but more than her share of detractors, as well. It was so affecting that Jacob, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TelevisionWithoutPity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TelevisionWithoutPity">Television Without Pity</a> recapper who made a regular running gag of her, devoted most of his recap of that episode to a deep psychological analysis of her (then again, Jacob writes deep psychological treatises about his breakfast muffin, so take this with a grain of salt). A good summary of the fan reaction would be <a class="urllink" href="http://frakkingtoasters.com//index.cgi?date=20080421">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. A lot of this has to do with the way she was offed. She was nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>, talked down from it, immediately knocked unconscious by the same person who talked her down, and woke up in time to see said person holding <em>Cally's own infant son</em> in a maternal-looking manner. She then met Cally's gaze and <em>gave a tiny smile</em> before pushing the button that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownOutTheAirlock">threw Cally out the airlock</a>. Even for the haters, that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">a bit much.</a>
</li><li> Another example is Anastasia Dualla, who started off well, but after her "relationship" with Apollo (dubbed "The Love That All of a Sudden", or - factoring in Starbuck and Anders - "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom">The Quadrangle of Dooooom</a>") was not very liked by the fandom. Then, in "Sometimes A Great Notion," after a nuclear war-ravaged Earth is found she, quite unexpectedly, blows her brains out after a long romantic date that gives her ex-husband (Apollo) hope that their relationship might be rekindled. It was probably a good writing decision, given that if she hadn't, what happened immediately after that series probably would have broken her spirit further.
</li><li> Kat's death could be taken as a candidate with much greater demographic appeal from the same show, particularly considering what was revealed about her past in the same episode. Though some viewers liked Kat; she was the only character who would consistently and unapologetically call Starbuck on her bullshit.
</li><li> Ellen Tigh, who was previously unsympathetic and disliked by much of the fanbase, got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">heartwrenching</a> death scene when her husband executes her for collaborating with the Cylons - something she did for <em>him</em>. The ironic thing is, <em>both</em> of them are Cylons, so she gets better.
</li><li> And then there's the death of the entire Quorum of Twelve - the very moment they finally do something <em>not</em> stupid, they all get killed for it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> had three notable examples:
<ul><li> The first was Bryce Larkin, who sent Chuck the Intersect in the first place and kicked the series off. Once it was revealed he was alive, his later interactions with Chuck generally involved him coming between Chuck and Sarah because of his own torch for Sarah, including even an apparent attempt to manipulate Chuck into breaking off his pursuit. But damned if his death in the second season finale didn't punch the fans in the gut.
</li><li> Emmett Millbarge was introduced in Season 2, and <em>very</em> quickly earned the dislike of many fans and characters alike. Besides being incredibly obnoxious, his manipulation of Morgan and Big Mike towards the end of the season for his own gain pushed many fans over the edge. The fact that he was the <em>only</em> character from Chuck's "normal" life to be killed off nonetheless drew a line with many fans who preferred a clear separation between Real World and Spy World. The fact he was unceremoniously and brutally killed off by getting <em>shot in the face</em> (granted, he <em>did</em> bring it on himself just by being Emmett), and the last we ever see of him is a pair of bloody glasses with a bullet hole through one lens just made it even more shocking.
</li><li> Finally is Daniel Shaw: Introduced in Season 3 and meant to be an example of the spy Chuck could be, most fans found Routh's performance dry and unlikable, and failing to convey the fact that Shaw and Chuck were supposed to be very much alike. The fact that he was introduced <em>specifically</em> to act as another hurdle to the increasingly played-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> between Chuck and Sarah just angered fans even further. But then it's revealed that Sarah (unknowingly, she thought it was just a mission) killed his wife under circumstances that were never fully explained,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14tru');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14tru" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14tru');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Was she a rogue agent Sarah was sent to terminate?

Then Ros became a (minor) player of her own, endearing her to the audience (who previously saw her as a waste of space) only be be cruelly murdered by Joffrey. Talisa also gained some fans by better writing and chemistry with her husband Robb Stark in the third season, and the reveal that she was pregnant and planning the name the baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Eddard</a>. Five minutes after this reveal she was violently stabbed to death in the <em>womb</em> by one of the Freys at the Red Wedding.
</li><li> Ellaria Sand and her daughters, colloquially called the Sand Snakes, were some of the least well-received characters in the show - largely for displacing a masterful scheming plotline from the books and mass-murdering their relatives for not being upset enough about the deaths of their <em>other</em> relatives. Oh and some truly awful fight scenes.

When she gets desperate and tries to escape she gets trapped in the debris and screams that she doesn&#146;t want to die over and over. Her brother comes back, originally planning to save her, but ends up comforting her in her final moments instead while she cries that she wants her baby to live.

However, she is shot and killed while saving fan favorite, Monroe, and essentially gave her blessing for him to move on and continue his romance with Rosalee.

In the second-season premiere, however, just as it looked like he might take on more of an active role with the Blackwood Project, Norton gets shot by a clone version of one of the main characters, gets enough strength to crawl over to a panic button and press it, then gets shot again off-screen... and then his body is blown to smithereens when the house he worked in explodes, and almost all of the characters promptly forgot about him.

But when Chapter 11 comes around and her death is practically foretold to happen any minute, it can still be very sad. She's about to be sacrificed to bring the prime dimension's Milla back from the abyss she's stuck in, but since Alternate Milla had begun a friendship with Elle - and is implied to have developed a crush on Ludger - it's still sad. And since the player can easily just drop Milla into the abyss, it comes off extra sad, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">she'll stare in absolute shock and hurt at the screen/player as she falls</a>.

Nova is doing her job and honestly doesn't know what's going on. And yelling at her results in her being <em>really</em> awkward and almost scared about calling you later.

In <em>Underworld</em>, Alister gets shot and killed by Lara's doppelganger, dying in Lara's arms.

His final duel with Thrall brought him surprising sympathy when Garrosh finally vented all his anger at Thrall for abandoning the Horde in its time of need, leaving Garrosh to pick up the pieces when even his own allies were already against him. Garrosh's obvious hurt and angry feelings probably helped, not to mention that Garrosh saw Thrall as a surrogate father-figure of sorts; his rant thus combines a sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">Calling the Old Man Out</a>.

Even after you confront her in Doma Castle, she goes on a long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> for why she turned into the miserable and loathing person everyone knew her for. While her backstory is sad (dead parents, sold off into a sex house, abusive stepparents, and more), the way she ranted made it sound more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> and her actions in response made her look extremely petty. When the character returned later on with amnesia, a lot of players hated her even more and assumed she would be redeemed simply because Gosetsu was taking care of her and she was now a helpless girl with no memories. Later on, Yotsuyu's memories return and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">she remembers all the horrible crimes she committed.</a> She tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">kill herself</a>, but she gets interrupted when her abusive step parents show up while mocking her weakness and aim to get her back into a whore house to make money. Realizing that people would never forgive her and would still remember her as a tyrant, Yotsuyu decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">become the monster everyone knew her for</a> and she renews her evil acts by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">killing her step parents</a>. She then turns into a primal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">fight a losing battle against the player character knowing that she cannot be redeemed</a>, During the fight, Yotsuyu's memory of Gosetsu materializes to protect her from her bad memories, showing that she still remembers his kindness towards her when she was amnesiac. With her dying breath once she's defeated, Yotsuyu uses the last remains of her strength to kill her step brother, who basically did nothing to help her when she was abused as a child and enabled such behavior to happen to her because he benefited from it. Many players who hated her suddenly found themselves feeling sorry for her.

Two, she's fighting with SHIKI at the High School and lets herself be torn apart by him to protect Kohaku. She barely holds on to consciousness long enough to ask Shiki: what is he doing at his school at night? He yells it's not important, and they need to get her help, but she keeps insisting on an answer. Finally he replies it's his school, and it's not strange if he's there either in the day or at night. Akiha seems to accept this answer, realizes it was a pretty simple conclusion, and then dies (this is actually part of Hisui's True End).

So, while it certainly doesn't excuse <em>all</em> of his horrible acts, one can't help but sympathize with Taurus to a certain extent in how he was essentially shoved down the road to becoming a monster without any choice on his part.</span> This was even lampshaded in how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">Rooster Teeth</a> stated that they wanted the audience to feel at least <em>some</em> sympathy for a character that should never normally receive it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, both of the Earls of Lemongrab are both extremely annoying and unpleasant characters. However, in the episode "Another Five More Short Graybles," the first Lemongrab apparently ate the second Lemongrab alive, appearing to have killed him. This segment of the episode ends on a massive cliffhanger as Lemongrab 2's fate is left ambiguous. Although both of them are seen as scrappies by fans for being extremely annoying, stupid, rude, and insane, most fans at the present time are worried sick about Lemongrab 2. The ones who believe that he is dead are actually <em>sad</em> that he apparently died in such an awful way, and the ones who still harbor hope for his life are sincerely wishing for his safe recovery.
<ul><li> The entire <em>Adventure Time</em> fanbase cried in unison when Lemongrab 2 actually died. It helped that his appearance in "Too Old" and other episodes leading to it made him more sympathetic than the first one.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with on the very last episode of the (original) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead">Beavis And Butthead</a></em> series, "Beavis and Butthead Are Dead." (They literally "call in dead" because they don't feel like going to school that day.) Most of the people at school - both students and faculty - subvert the trope in that they are at best apathetic, but Mr. Van Driessen actually cries over their "deaths." Of course, this may not be the best example since Mr. Van Driessen was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a> who tolerated the boys' misbehavior to an absurd degree.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Exosquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Exosquad">Exosquad</a></em> series there are several notable examples, but the most Prominent was the much hated Captian Matthew Marcus. Not only was he lacking of strategic skills, had sheer arrogance, sported a hair-trigger temper, and tyrannical in that he charged the first officer to question his dangerous orders as a mutineer, but he practically single-handedly crippled the Exo-Fleet. Not only was that humanity's greatest hope in winning the war and saving their species, but did so after going to mutiny, creating a coup, and sending the best combat squad on a dangerous and meaningless mission. Despite all this, he had an incredible send off in that he refused to give up the fight, attempting to redeem his failures and actions. When a protagonist was sent in to rescue him he refused to leave, forcing him to leave at gun point and going for a heroic sacrifice, taking out a number of enemy ships and buying some time for the survivors of the fleet he destroyed to escape. His last words were to be relayed to the Admiral he betrayed: "Tell him that Matthew Marcus knew how to die!"
<ul><li> Somewhat subverted that despite the impact and incredibly well done death being very memorable. He was never really missed by fans, also, that last scene as he has the Exo-Carrier self destruct in enemy lines has his face showing a less heroic expression, but more of a crazed suicidal rump of joy!
</li></ul></li><li> The Magus in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> three-parter "Avalon". It helps that he just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>. And he finally overcame his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> towards Goliath's clan in particular long enough to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>; he'd overcome his general racism years ago since he spent his life raising the gargoyle children. His "Avalon" appearance was also noteworthy for its use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Dogged Nice Guy</a> and the gentle but merciless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRunnerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticRunnerUp">Romantic Runner-Up</a>.
</li><li> The fan reaction to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPZW4vUUONc">Mako's almost-death scene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> during the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>. Subverted in that he'd gone through a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> by then, and had grown out of his tendencies that had made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> in the first place.

<ul><li> Sierra is severely injured and loses all her hair in the explosion that results in her elimination immediately after winning invincibility, just because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">she made a birthday cake for Cody, who was completely ignored on his last birthday.</a>
</li><li> Even if you feel like Dave was the bad guy in the Sky/Dave debacle, you gotta feel bad for him/mad with Sky when Sky reveals that she still has a boyfriend, and then, <em>on international television</em>, says that he "wasn't the one" in favor of Dave. Learning this fact after she's kissed him is what cements his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>.
</li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em>: Even the people who hated the Best Friends and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a> thought that their treatment throughout "Last Tango in Buenos Aires" was too harsh and uncalled for. Especially when Devin is accidentally pushed off a cliff, which puts him in a full body cast and results in the team being removed from the competition.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Rock Bottom," Miko <em>almost</em> got this. Long reviled for her tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnoopingLittleKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnoopingLittleKid">charge after the Autobots into the line of fire</a>, jeopardizing the mission and sometimes many lives, and worse, <em>explicitly didn't care about endangering lives, only how much fun it is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmsWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmsWay">In Harm's Way</a>,</em> in this episode she's simply allowed to accompany them into a mine they <em>think</em> is safe. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Megatron</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Starscream</a> happen upon the mine, causing large sections to cave in. Bulkhead saves Miko by holding up the portion of the cave ceiling just above her, but this means he can't move. Demonstrating impressive strength, Miko begins yanking up the large boulders blocking the tunnel and throwing them aside, in a nonetheless vain attempt to save Bulkhead that nearly kills her from asphyxiation. Even when Jack conveniently barges in with a boring machine and rescues Miko, now all-but dead, she's horrified to leave Bulkhead to his fate. He is later rescued, too, so everything ends up okay, but it's still probably the decisive moment when Miko begins to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a>.
</li><li> "Hurt" does a lot more for this trope. Bulkhead is mortally wounded and hanging to life by a thread after a battle with Hardshell, and Miko spends the entire episode brooding and dead serious, traumatized by Bulkhead's predicament. After watching Wheeljack nearly die as well, she inflicts her first Decepticon kill on Hardshell and ultimately returns home feeling no better after attaining vengeance. Miko spends the ending sobbing as Ratchet informs her that Bulkhead may never be fully functional again.
