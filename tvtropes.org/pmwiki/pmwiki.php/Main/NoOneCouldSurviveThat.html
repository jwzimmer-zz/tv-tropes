<ul><li> Ben survives stuff like being crushed under a large boulder and getting hit by giant bears and a special attack that damages the insides of the victim (both <em>multiple times</em>). In the end, however, he does die... of old age. His tendency to live through practically anything is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">info book</a> for the original series.
</li><li> Akame has shrugged off such minor annoyances as <em>getting a scythe to the neck</em>, a spear-like front leg to the abdomen and a(n admittedly normal) paw wrist-deep in his chest.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>, Hana gets sucked into a whirlpool when she falls into a strong, icy current and everyone assumes she will drown, since trying to save and going after her shows that the pull is incredibly strong and the water is pretty deep and will likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">not find her alive or dead</a>. If <em>that</em> wasn't enough, turns out Hana ends up submerged, completely underwater, in a fetal position for about two days - given the events that occur right after this moment - and seems to be unconscious... and yet survives! When she is eventually found by some of her team members, who think she never could've survived, given the circumstances, she explains to them how she survived (she says the water she was submerged in was warm) they find it hard to believe her, but are too happy that she <em>is</em> alive to really care.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, Trowa's temporarily-borrowed mobile suit, the Veyate, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> explodes after a fight with Quatre and his newly-constructed monster, the Gundam Wing Zero.

Yet, SEED Destiny makes him survive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">never gives an explanation.</a></span>
</li><li> Another strike against DESTINY: The ending of the original SEED had Mwu's <em>broken</em> helmet floating through space to show that, yes, he was really dead. Fan demand had them <em>edit out the helmet footage</em> from the Special Edition to let them revive him. This didn't go down well with everyone, obviously.

Showing how smart they can be the writers played a half dozen tricks that had the audience saying this. To sum it up, in episode 23 of the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">he and his beloved Colonel switch sides in order to help Celestial Being Fight Against the Innovators.</a> In the heat of battle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">he then throws himself in front of three kamikaze mobile suits to protect her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">while confessing his love for her at the top of his lungs.</a> As this happens, Kati <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">shouts his full name for the first time in the series.</a> With all of these strikes against him, it seems that our beloved Patrick was down for the count and not coming back, especially since around this time in the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">important characters had been dying by the bucketload.</a> And yet, in the final episode, who should show up but Patrick, not only having survived without a scratch, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">revealing that he was about to be married to Kati</a></span>.
</li><li> It continues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer">Gundam 00: A Wakening of the Trailblazer</a></em> when Patrick <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is about to commit suicide rather than be assimilated by the ELS. Setsuna arrives and shoots the ELS trying to take his mobile suit, which also blows up Patrick's mobile suit</span>. Yet Patrick is shown tumbling away from the explosion, inexplicably unharmed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> S</em>, when Usagi is surprised to see Kaorinite again after she was frozen and thrown off a cliff, Artemis reminds her that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a>.
<ul><li> Kaorinite throws Sailor Neptune over a waterfall, yet she survives.
</li><li> During this same season, Neptune knowingly walks down a path lined with Machine guns that trigger each time she takes a step. She keeps going until the guns run out of ammo. No blood is shown but each time she takes a step it shows her getting filled with bullets each step (Albeit in silhouette). The villain who rigged the trap is confounded that she managed to make it over to her let alone live. She dies moments later from a different source though.
</li><li> Later, at the end of <em>SuperS</em>, Nehelenia throws Chibiusa off the zeppelin of the Dead Moon Circus, and Super Sailor Moon dives off of it without a second thought. Nehelenia returns to her seal, confident that she's killed Princess Serenity. She is later understandably upset in <em>Stars</em> when Galaxia reveals that Serenity survived.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: Seto Kaiba <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryAndFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryAndFollow">jumps out a window</a> to escape from pursuing thugs, who deliver the line. In a slight twist, a character who is supposedly Kaiba's ghost appears after this, making it seem as if the thugs were right: it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">later turns out</a> that he did survive and that the ghost is a fake. In the dub, the character's supposedly the physical manifestation of Kaiba's inner darkness.
<ul><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em>:

</div></li><li> This also happens when Marik uses the Dragon of Ra to attack Joey, which should cause him so much pain that he should be vaporized. Thankfully, Joey's an anime character, so he manages to survive, and is up and walking around several episodes later.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, protagonist Lelouch lures <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> Mao</span> into a trap where a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Controlled</a> police officers gun him down. When the villain returns in the next episode, he remarks that Lelouch really should have told them to "shoot to kill" not just "shoot", and also compliments the Britannian health care system.
<ul><li> Late in the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Cornelia</span> is gunned down by a machine gun turret. The next episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> is seen lying in a hospital bed, injured but recovering.
</li><li> C.C. may be the grand champion of "being able to survive anything". In the first episode, she was shot in the head and returned in episode five as though nothing happened.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Broly takes this trope to the logical extreme and <em>beyond</em>, having survived getting punched through the torso and then the planet he was on exploding. Then in his next appearance, Gohan tries to kill him with an erupting volcano and it barely singes the Legendary Super Saiyan. It takes blowing him into the sun with a triple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">Kamehame Ha</a> to put him down. Though even then there's enough left of him to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">bio-organic copies of him</a>.
</li><li> Played with in regards to Dr. Wheelo, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the movie <em>The World's Strongest</em>. It's invoked by Krillin, then instantly shot down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Goku of all people</a>, who, despite having just Kamehame Ha'd him into <em>low orbit</em>, knows he's still alive.
</li><li> Out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam">Z-Fighters</a>:
<ul><li> Goku has recovered from the worst imaginable beatings, as well as numerous explosions, and shot straight through with energy beams, Frieza even calls him a "zombie" at one point. The movies dial it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> as Goku gets the life beaten out of him repeatedly but still gets back up.
</li><li> Piccolo, thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, has recovered from horrific injuries; at one point he was turned to stone and Kid Trunks accidentally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives">smashed him to pieces</a></em>. When the stone spell wore off Piccolo was up and ready to go in a minute having healed his body off-screen.
</li><li> Vegeta is the ultimate example of this trope. As a villain survived getting blown into the sky by Goku's Kamehame Ha combined with a 4x Kaioken boost, and then tanked the Spirit Bomb not long after (both times he was thought to be dead and wasn&#146;t). When he&#146;s an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, Vegeta gets as many beatings from villains as Goku. <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> takes this to such an extreme that he's shown surviving <em>his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Suicide Attack</a>, the exact same one that cost him his second life in the Buu Saga</em>.
</li><li> Gohan has survived attacks worse than most of Z-Fighters receive, but his greatest survivability feat comes from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">future self</a>, who survived an explosion that blew his arm off and refused to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHerb">senzu bean</a> on himself giving it to Trunks instead.
</li><li> Hell, even Yamcha, <em>the ultimate jobber</em>, was still breathing after Dr. Gero put a hand through his torso. Most villains don't survive getting impaled like that, but Yamcha was up and moving after a single senzu bean despite the massive hole in his sternum.
</li></ul></li><li> The outcome of Goku and Freeza's death match on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">crumbling planet Namek</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku and Freeza <em>both</em> survive the planet's destruction. Albeit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">a little worse for wear</a> in Freeza's case.</span>
</li><li> Cooler surpasses his brother Frieza and other villains when it comes to this trope as he came back from being Kamehame Ha'd into the sun (something not even Broly could do). This was thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalAbomination">Big Gete Star</a> absorbing a chunk of Cooler's face (that's was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">still alive</a></em>) and gave him new life.
<ul><li> Note that in <em>Super</em> this is how Frieza was resurrected the first time: <em>in the exact same chunks Future Trunks had cut him down to</em>. And each and every one of these chunks were <em>pretty alive</em>. That sort of survivability <em>definitely runs with his race</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Majin Buu invoked this, considering how much Piccolo freaks out seeing Buu reform after Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">nuked himself</a> to stop the creature.
</li></ul></li><li> The villain Gauron from the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> also takes this trope and runs with it... about 4 or 5 times. This includes being shot in the head before the series starts, two Arm Slaves exploding around him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and a self-detonation sequence of a third. However, he comes out of that last one as a quadruple amputee with a missing eye</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">It doesn't seem to dampen his spirits much.</a>
</li><li> Saitou Hajime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> is so great at this, he practically lampshades it to Sagara Sanosuke as he walked and smoked nonchalantly to seemingly-certain death at the climax of the Kyoto arc. He lampshades it again when he makes his return during the Jinchuu arc to the disbelief of the Kenshingumi, even going so far as to refer to himself as the Shinsengumi's sole immortal.
<ul><li> Another example. Kenshin jumps into a river to save a stupid rich kid. The man who's goons he'd been fighting at the time proceeded to say, "I hear the water runs quite fast around here," and leaves him for dead. Never mind the fact that he just kicked the stuffing out of the villain's top four lieutenants, and, having jumped voluntarily, the hero thought that he could take it.
</li><li> Makoto Shishio could very well be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for this. He survived being shot in the head, being doused in oil and set on fire, and even having his head cleaved in two!
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> when Clare, to throw the insane Ophelia off her trail, deliberately gets herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">severely wounded</a> and knocked off a cliff into a rushing river. Unfortunately for her, Ophelia is wise about this...
</li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a> 2</em>-hour special has a man fall off a cliff as he is shot, a scene with his comrades deciding that he is dead because there's no way he survived, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">the information that only his jacket was ever recovered</a> and all the characters in the episode believe he is really alive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And in a subversion, it was all a misleading tactic. Apparently, he really didn't survive that.</span>
</li><li> Akito experiences the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a> version at least twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>.

</li><li> Nemu Kurotsuchi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">impregnated by Szayel Aporro Granz and then as she struggles in extreme pain, and then her belly explodes, her body devoured and Szayel came out forcefully from her mouth.

And then she still came back to her old self of a body because Mayuri <em>had sex</em> on her (or so Uryu &amp; Renji's reactions imply; Mayuri insists they must be perverts to think that)</span>. Needless to say, this is one instance where this trope can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky to the max</a>.
<ul><li> Her Captain Kurotsuchi Mayuri is not free from this trope either, especially when he fought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Uryu Ishida</a> and took a full brunt of his arrow, leaving his body blown up, partially. If he didn't have that ability to turn himself into a liquid, he's as good as dead.
<ul><li> An arrow that tore through Mayuri's bankai as if it were made of paper, and minor energy leakage from it completely disintegrated surrounding buildings <em>that weren't actually even hit</em>. Ishida was at the time utilizing a form at the time that would burn out his power shortly afterward but temporarily made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">one of the most powerful beings in existence</a>. At least half of Mayuri's body no longer existed after he was hit. But then he turned himself to liquid and took a week or two to be back to what passes for normal in his case.
</li></ul></li><li> What about Ichigo? He's been stabbed, sliced almost in half (except for his spine), had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ulquiorra's <em>arm</em> through his chest, and was shot through the same spot (albeit more of it) by the same Arrancar's cero</span>. In the last, he's apparently back on his feet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">without even being healed first.</span> However, that's probably because of his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Inner Hollow</a></span>.

<ul><li> Pell the strongest Royal Soldier of Alabasta, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed himself to grab a bomb and fly it into the stratosphere</a>. The bomb, had a kill radius of five miles, and exploded narrowing avoiding damage to the city, and leaving everyone from harm, except himself. Pell's sacrifice was mourned. However, <em>he managed to survive</em>, and this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by him seeing his own gravestone, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and in Movie 8, which is a retelling of the storyline, he meets up with princess Vivi in the end, to receive a giant emotional hug</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio">Monster Trio</a> (Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji) have survived things that would certainly kill their other crewmates. Luffy has come back after getting his body almost melted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson">Magellan</a> in the Impel Down arc as numerous explosions and impalements. Zoro has incredible endurance being able to absorb all of the damage and fatigue Luffy had received in the Thriller Bark arc, Zoro has also lost more blood any other crew member. Sanji in the Skypeia arc tanked a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">lighting beam</a> from Enel that was strong enough one-shot a giant snake and even vaporize a normal human being.
<ul><li> All three of them could also handle swimming 5000 feet underwater, where there's enough pressure to crack a submarine. Or even earlier in the Jaya Arc when the trio were thought to be dead when they seemly were swallowed whole by a gargantuan turtle, yet only a few minutes later they showed up again no worse for wear. Usopp and other crewmates don't believe Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are even human at times.

</li><li> Domflamingo is worthy of mention as he recovered from getting his internal organs sliced by Law's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Gamma Knife</a> and was still alive after Luffy's Kong Gun punching him through the island.
</li><li> The Yonkos live and breath this trope, Whitebeard kept going after getting his face blasted off (and lava punched through the torso) and only died after getting shot a billion-something times.

<ul><li> Special mention for Big Mom's sons Perospero and Oven, the former surviving the aforementioned dynamite explosion (losing an arm in the process); and the latter recovering from being getting run over a massive tank ship and being shot through with an energy beam respectively.

After getting sliced up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">Obi-Wan</a>, he falls near the lava and incinerates. Obi-Wan figures Anakin will never survive having all his limbs sliced off and his skin burned, and so leaves him to die. Palpatine saves him. One would think Obi-Wan would've given at least a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>, as it seems uncharacteristically cruel to leave him to burn like that, but since we already had Episodes IV, V and VI he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a> to let Anakin live. One answer is he did not leave Anakin because he thought he would die, or anything like that. He left Anakin because he had already come dangerously close to falling to the Dark Side in his own rage, anger, and grief at losing someone he loved. Whatever Anakin felt about Obi-Wan, Obi-Wan still thought of him as little Ani. So he steps away, afraid of falling entirely to the Dark Side, and leaves Anakin to the fate of the Force. In the novelisation, he acknowledges that killing Anakin would be the merciful thing to do, but was aware of Palpatine's presence and knew he wouldn't have time. He decides to leave it up to The Force. He also wasn't feeling very merciful.

The main villain is told that they "are certainly dead"; naturally, with their superhuman reflexes, they are able not only to flee but also to build an army on a practically uninhabitable desert planet described as being able to conquer the galaxy. To be fair to the Baron Harkonnen, he immediately smacks his minion in the mouth for doing something so stupid as to assume his enemies are dead without actually seeing their bodies, and then sends his forces back out to find the bodies. Naturally, they don't. But he did at least try!

Partly justified the first 3 occasions with him using telekinesis to keep from being fatally hurt - though he must have been VERY skilled at it, and very focused. The last time in Volume One, we saw a trail of blood leading to a manhole, though this was justified by having someone ELSE carry him away instead of him CRAWLING into a manhole.

<ul><li> In the most generic sense, the trope as applied here has to do with a wrestler (often a face) enduring tremendous punishment, usually from a feared monster heel, including several finishing moves that are described as devastating. Commentator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> often made a habit of exclaiming such signature lines as, "By Gawd, he's broken in half! Nobody gets up from that!" only to express surprise when the face somehow manages to kick out of a pinning combination at two following a move that would severely injure or kill a "normal" wrestler (i.e., a jobber), or power out of a devastating submission move.
</li><li> Many such incidents of this trope have somehow involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>:
<ul><li> One of the most infamous examples was in the "Hell in a Cell Match" with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> at King of the Ring 1998. The first was the spot where Taker lobbed him off the top of the cell and through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpanishAnnouncersTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpanishAnnouncersTable">Spanish Announcers' Table</a>, the second was the chokeslam through the roof of the cell to the mat. The first was planned, the second was not; with that chokeslam, Foley ate a good fifteen-foot fall onto the thumbtack-strewn canvas and a folding chair landed on his face. Foley was legitimately knocked out at least <em>twice</em> and color commentator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> legitimately believed that Foley had suffered fatal injuries in the match.
</li><li> As for Undertaker himself, in January 1998 he was sealed in a coffin before heel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer">Paul Bearer</a> and his lackey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> set the casket on fire, although the trope was averted when &#150; expecting to see a burned corpse &#150; Bearer opened the badly charred casket only to find it empty (he really should have known by then that Taker knows how to escape a locked casket); he'd later learn that Taker had somehow escaped before the casket was set on fire.

In the ending of The Lost Age, the Wise One prevents him from gaining the full power of the Golden Sun and leaves him for dead. On top of a <em>volcano that later erupts obliterating everything around it, and eventually collapses</em>. He appears without as much as a scratch twenty years later in Dark Dawn: when Kraden confronts him about that, he merely answers with a smirk.

Bowser has fallen into lava on multiple accounts, fallen into a bottomless pit at least once, been inside his castle when it exploded at least twice, been frozen solid and broken in two, had his flesh burned off... it's really no surprise at this point that he can also survive getting crushed. In fact, <em>Inside Story</em> serves to explain how he got out of those other jams.
</li><li> Double subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> dies or commits suicide, when you issue the order to either save the Council, attack the ship that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> was indoctrinated by, or let the Council die.

And then Shepard <em>recovers</em>.
</li><li> A less important example is in Wreav. During the ride to the Shroud, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">Kalros</a> comes by and eats the car Wreav is in.

</li><li> The Reapers finally slip up near the end of the game, when Harbinger personally comes down next to a transport beam and catches Shepard in a blast, along with the rest of the strike force. After it leaves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Shepard gets up and, though horrifically wounded and in great pain, s/he keeps moving towards the beam.</a>

Snake gets slightly suspicious later on when he finds a parachute caught in a tree ("No way, he'd be sliced up faster than an onion in an infomercial..." since the Mi-24 doesn't have an ejection system), and sure enough, he comes back for more. He pilots the Metal Gear REX against Snake at the climax of the game and eats several MORE Stingers, this time into the open cockpit. He then fistfights his brother on the back of REX and gets thrown off. He gets into a Jeep and pursues Snake during his escape, taking heavy machine gun fire all the while. When both Jeeps crash, Liquid hauls himself toward Snake, FAMAS in hand and covered in blood. He finally keels over from a FOXDIE-induced heart attack. And <em>then</em> he comes back by possessing Revolver Ocelot through his transplanted forearm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Actually scratch that last one, Liquid wasn&#146;t actually possessing Ocelot, he just made himself and Snake believe was even though Liquid was long dead.</span>

Nox Obscurus subsequently vanishes into a nebulous cloud of gas and an unconscious Edge is shown aimlessly drifting through space. In a later scene, Edge appears onboard the Calnus completely unscathed without explanation.

Only then does he die</span>.
</li><li> This also happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a> Original Generation</em> saga. Lamia Loveless was forcefully pulled out from a Bartoll pod using Alt Eisen Riese's Revolving Bunker, all while naked, already damaged, and bound with the cables inside, anyone can say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsGottaHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsGottaHurt">That's Gotta Hurt</a> at that point. To make things worse, she got shot down while laying down in Alt Eisen Riese's arm without recovering from the previous damage, not by a mere gun, but with a dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, all while NAKED AND DEFENSELESS. People think that she wouldn't survive at all... except that she survived just by a very small margin, because the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> made it in time to reprogram her and turn her against her allies. And the scene of her ultimate rescue was just as brutal, Axel uses his strongest attack only to plug her out of the machine that kept here, yet she still survives for the ultimate repair. If you call Code Kirin weaker than Revolving Bunker, well that's just ridiculous... But then again, she was in a bigger mecha so a way stronger attack may be necessary to plug her out.
<ul><li> And it was actually PRECEDED, when she self destructs to save the team from the Shadow Mirror, and she got Lemon to haul her in the last minute and repair her and let her off...
<ul><li> Justified, as she's a <em>robot</em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">ridiculously human one</a>, built mainly for infiltration and for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperAgent">Sleeper Agent</a> operations. Meaning, she's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">not literally</a>), but still she's definitely covered when it comes to replacing the damaged parts of her body, because of said explosions and possible shrapnel, with little to no trauma afterwards. Neither the game or the anime, however, capitalize on this little tidbit.
</li><li> Averted for her voice module, that thing never goes unscathed without at least a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">Funetik Aksent</a> due to the dangers she's constantly exposed. The most recent one even got her to occasionally talk in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">high-pitched, energetic</a> voice, a stark contrast to her own personality! <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2tpsb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2tpsb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2tpsb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which also happens to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to her older "sister", Aschen Brodel, from the spinoff series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessFrontier">Endless Frontier</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Axel Almer also adheres this trope fully, probably in a far more impossible odds than Lamia. Let's see... he got blasted into pieces, almost all limbs said to be broken, had his death speech and all, and his place of death was merged into an alien body (and supposedly his body too)... Banpresto's answer? Have a quirky mercenary squadron haul his machine remnants in the last minutes, JUST BEFORE THE MERGING, and have ANOTHER DEAD character (Alfimi) possess his soul briefly so he can wake up in the future time. He has no body modifications before, he's just a human that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">happens to be too tough for his own good</a>. Maybe his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">popularity</a> ever since he played the villain part ultimately causes this...
</li><li> Speaking of which, even Kyosuke Nanbu fell to this trope several times. Before the game timeline, he suffered a plane crash that could've killed him... yet he came out with just some scratches and bruises. Next, when he was trying a test run of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Transforming Mecha</a>, it malfunctioned, exploded with him inside, and the mech sank to the water... yet he came out with just a few broken ribs. In <em>Original Generation 2</em>, Axel Almer proceeds to use his strongest attack to rip Kyosuke's mech to shreds, which Kyosuke not only survives but promptly gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">massive update to his mech</a> so it doesn't happen again. And where does that credit to? His luck. What a lucky bastard.
<ul><li> Kyosuke's abnormal Luck is actually one of the traits he's famous for. He <em>routinely</em> survives attacks that were supposed to kill him, and fans speculate that this luck is what allows Kyosuke to perform well in his Alteisen, which is, in all honesty, an outdated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">clumsy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre">Real Robot Genre</a> that really wants to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">Super Robot Genre</a> when it grows up. Anyone else using the Alt would probably find themselves shot down pretty quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> Oh, and Excellen Browning also got it a bit worse. She was supposedly dead at the plane crash with Kyosuke, but the Einst hauled her in the last minute so they can partially put their parts on her, and that ensured her survival.
<ul><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a> Game in general will do when it comes to the destructive powers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> Mecha.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to Axel, the Inspector Mekibos survives the obliteration of his unit towards the end of OG2 (or SRW3, if you prefer) because he was lucky. Of course, this <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Mekibos</a>.

</li><li> In the early missions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a> 2</em>, Logan makes a leap of faith to dodge a helicopter-launched missile not once, but twice, first diving <em>headfirst</em> off a cliff of unknown height, then later off a 100-foot or so high bridge <em>onto a moving train</em>. There's no way these leaps could be survived in real life, at least not without crippling injuries. In fact, jumping onto a speeding train from a stationary object would cause one to slide backwards and sustain severe lacerations or broken bones, maybe fall between the cars and be shredded under the wheels. Apparently, the designers disregarded Newton's third law. Don't think the snow in the first case would do much to cushion the impact, either (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a>).
<ul><li> And during the Agency Biolab Escape mission, he jumps a hundred feet or so down a large ventilation shaft and grabs onto a ledge a few feet above a gigantic fan, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> style. If this were realistic, his fingers/wrists would snap on impact and he'd be shredded by the fan "like an onion in an infomercial".

<ul><li> Phoenix Wright is not only lucky in winning trials, but he's also damn lucky in surviving. In the final case of <em>Trials and Tribulations</em>, Phoenix attempts to cross a burning bridge, which breaks apart, causing him to fall 40 feet below into a fast-flowing river. If that didn't kill him, the freezing cold water (since it was winter at the time) would have, right? WRONG! Phoenix gets away with only a few bruises and a nasty cold. Also, during <em>Apollo Justice</em>, Phoenix gets hit by a car, goes flying 30 feet into the air and smacks his head into a telephone pole. Crazily enough, his head is fine and he only suffers a sprained ankle!
</li><li> The case before this is an even more consequential example. In a flashback, Mia Fey defends a death row convict who had previously been found guilty of pushing his girlfriend off the bridge and into the deadly river below. The exact same bridge and river, in fact. Until late in the current trial, it is considered unthinkable that the woman could have survived, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">let alone might have jumped on purpose... or could in fact be in the courtroom right now</span>.

As Taurus Bulba's Ram Rod, a gravity gun, explodes violently in a gigantic fireball (large enough to engulf the top of Canard Tower, which is taller than the city is wide), both the villain and Darkwing are caught at ground zero. Gosalyn and Launchpad both believe that Darkwing has died, until he appears at the orphanage a few days later, having decided to adopt Gosalyn as his daughter. Surprisingly, Taurus Bulba did in fact die. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">his remains were subsequently stolen by the criminal organization F.O.W.L., and made into a nigh-unstoppable cyborg</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> <em>lives</em> for this trope. To list all the examples would take too much time, so only the two most memorable ones will be listed:
<ul><li> Jean-Pierre, the chef, who in the very <em>first</em> episode was shot at by a rocket, which propelled him into the Hatredcopter's blades, chopping him into many many pieces. Not only did he survive that, when Dethklok tried and failed to cook for themselves, they <em>sewed him back together</em>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>, but he came back with no effect on his cooking skills (aside from the one time he accidentally killed the Queen of Denmark, but that is a different story).
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Charles Ofdensen, the manager, successfully fended off the Metal-Masked Assassin when he tried to kill off Dethklok in the first season finale. The assassin comes after him in the second season finale, chasing after him on a Dethspider, finally catching him when one of his allies shot Ofdensen through the chest with an arrow. The assassin then proceeded to beat the shit out of Ofdensen, breaking his glasses and cutting him up in the process. Everyone believed he had died from his injuries. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Which was exactly what Ofdensen WANTED them to think.</a></span>
<ul><li> Season 4, however, revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ofdensen actually <em>did</em> die. However, it was at the hands of a Dethklok medic at Ofdensen's insistence and he was revived by the Church of the Black Klok. He had to die to fill his role in the prophecy, you see</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation">Filmation</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a></em> cartoon "Finger of Doom". An observatory is destroyed by a beam of light from a rogue star. Superboy utters the immortal line "No one could have survived that." It turns out that Dr. Bailey, an astronomer who was in the observatory when it exploded, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">gained superpowers and been driven mad</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first story arc ends with Megatron at ground zero of a Space Bridge explosion. He survives thanks to Dark Energon he embedded in his spark, but both Autobots and Decepticons write him off until Soundwave picks up a faint energy signal. Megatron is still out of commission for a good part of the season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport">though</a>.
</li><li> Prior to the start of the series, Shockwave was caught in an exploding Space Bridge and presumed dead by Starscream and the other Decepticons. He awakened on Cybertron, repaired himself, and continued his research in solitude.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>
<ul><li> In both of his appearances, the Toyman is caught in explosions and presumed dead. He finally gets arrested in a crossover episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>.
</li><li> Played with in "Identity Crisis", where Bizarro is presumed to die saving Superman and Lois from an explosion. Luthor warns Superman to clear out before activating the self-destruct, telling him the specifics of how violent the blast will be and claiming "not even you" can survive it. When Lois later wonders whether Bizarro is dead or not, Superman really has no idea; he's never experienced an explosion that violent, but if Luthor was wrong, then Bizarro, being his clone, could have survived. (And as it turned out, he did.)
</li><li> In "The Late Mr. Kent", Clark Kent uncovers evidence that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearTheirName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearTheirName">exonerates a convicted murderer</a>, leading the real killer to plant a bomb in his car. He's not hurt, of course, but he has to let people believe that Clark is dead until he can find a way to explain his survival without revealing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> does this with Entrapta, who the heroes see get trapped in an incinerator just seconds before it activates. They naturally assume her dead and mourn her loss. The next episode reveals that she actually used a reprogrammed robot to shield herself from the flames and spent a few days waiting for rescue. She instead ends up found by Catra and Scorpia, with the three of them coming to the conclusion that she's been abandoned by the Rebellion. This realization combined with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a> attitude leads to Entrapta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>, with the heroes completely unaware she's still alive.
</li><li> In a heroic variation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a> and Penfold are presumed squashed after Baron Greenback (using an anti-gravity ray) drops the Statue of Liberty on them (episode "The Statue of Liberty Caper") when they suddenly appear in front of Greenback unscathed. How? According to DM, the statue is hollow and he and Penfold stood right where the hole on the base of the statue was.

While working on a railway tunnel, an accident with explosives resulted in a 1.25-inch diameter metal rod getting shot <em>through his skull</em>, entering below his chin and exiting out his forehead. He survived - even managing to remain conscious and talkative in the minutes following the accident - and lived a long life (albeit with some behavioral alterations, like misogyny, though just how much his personality changed is now disputed). The brain injury eventually finished him off but still! Even more miraculous? This happened during the 1800s, prior to the discovery of antibiotics, vaccinations, or any other modern medical treatment.

<dl><dd><ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTQBVDV1E7s">This crash<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from Canada 2007 only caused a concussion and a sprained ankle. The driver passed medical with no ill effects but still had to miss the next race so as not to risk two concussions in two weeks.
</li><li> Similarly: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_RyFhH4eAo">This guy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is returning to F1 next season, after getting hit in the face (!) by a 1kg piece of metal spring...at a relative speed of about 100mph (160kph or 2kJ.)
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> For a comparison between no one could survive that and someone actually not surviving a more minor looking accident in motor racing, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxunjVkYxYA">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> wreck at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans had the car bouncing off the Armco like a pinball at 180 MPH or so, and reduced the car to its frame. The driver walked away with a cut on his arm. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNx13pUqFhw">This<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> wreck from the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, on the other hand, consisted of a single impact at "only" 105 MPH and left the car largely in one piece (though obviously heavily damaged), but the driver died of his injuries shortly after arriving at the medical center.
</li><li> Auto racing wrecks tend to look a lot worse than they actually are. The drivers wear a lot of protective gear, and the cars are designed to fall apart so as to direct the force of impact away from the driver. For example, there has been one driver fatality in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> racing since Ayrton Senna died in 1994 when Jules Bianchi succumbed to head injuries suffered in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. (A few marshalls have been killed, and Maria de Vilotta's death was related to her accident, but she lived for a little over a year after it.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath">The story of Rasputin</a>. According to sources, he was poisoned, shot twice, curb-stomped, beaten with a metal cane, tied up, and thrown into a lake before he finally kicked the bucket. The ultimate cause of death was drowning, though not for lack of trying <em>everything</em> else.
<ul><li> Incidentally, the poison was a literal example: it was more than enough to kill him several times over. It's thought that it evaporated when they baked the cake it was in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">In truth</a>, his 1916 autopsy revealed he died instantly after being shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">in the head</a> with a .455, and the fabled circumstances of his death were likely fabrications by his opponents to paint him as a nearly-unkillable force of evil and corruption.
</li></ul></li><li> After the Russian Royal family were murdered in 1918, several imposters claiming to be the surviving children popped up trying to get into their grandmother&#146;s good books. Anyone who claimed to be son Alexei was turned away immediately because he had hemophilia and couldn&#146;t have survived any of the physical trauma he would have endured.

You'd think nothing could survive that. However, by the time the man made it to the hospital, the spider had shaken off the ill treatment and was up and moving again, struggling to get out of the jar. Mr. Stevens, the man who was bitten, took the jar with him to the hospital. It was inadvertently released <em>within hospital grounds</em>.

He was a tail gunner of a Lancaster bomber. A night fighter shot the plane in fire, and the pilot gave the command to jump. His parachute inside the fuselage caught fire. He decided to jump to his death without a parachute rather than burn alive with the doomed bomber. Miraculously, he fell almost five kilometres into pine trees which slowed down his fall, and he survived with bruises and broken bones. The Germans who captured him did not at first believe him, but when they found the wreck of the bomber, they believed him and wrote him a certificate of what happened.

</li><li> A few airplane-related miracle survival stories:
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider">Gimli Glider<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was a Boeing 767 that ran out of fuel over Canada because of improper calculations involving pounds vs kilograms. The pilot managed to miraculously pull off a dead stick landing that, according to Discovery Channel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AirCrashInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AirCrashInvestigation">Air Crash Investigation</a></em>, any subsequent pilot that attempted the scenario in a simulator crashed the simulated plane.
<ul><li> It should be noted that the pilot was one of the few commercial pilots who was also an accomplished glider pilot, so it was less a miracle that he was able to pull off the landing which required a few maneuvers frequently done in gliding but hardly ever in motorized flight, and more a miracle that he was the pilot assigned to that flight!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Airlines_Flight_243">Hawaiian Airlines Flight 243<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the plane's fuselage failed, the roof was ripped off, and the pilots STILL managed to land with only ONE fatality, which was a direct result of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveDecompression">Explosive Decompression</a>, not the emergency landing.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232">United Airlines Flight 232<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was another one. Ground maintenance later admitted that when the flight engineer explained the situation, their first thought was "we're talking to a dead man". The plane did crash (and break up) on landing, but over half of the passengers and crew survived the accident. Similar to the Gimli Glider situation, simulator pilots were able to replicate this feat only with the assistance of the original pilot.
<ul><li> While recuperating in the hospital after the accident, one of the pilots from UA 232 saw news footage of a horrific plane crash and immediately had the thought that no one could have survived that. He was stunned to learn that that was footage of his own accident.

</li><li> American and British heavy bombers were famous for taking debilitating damage and still making it home, sometimes with one engine working out of four and a gunner flying the plane because the pilots were dead. In one case, a B-17 collided with a fighter over Germany &mdash; and did not break in half until <em>after</em> it had landed safely back in England.
</li><li> Saburo Sakai flew a severely damaged Mitsubishi Zero 800 miles (from Guadalcanal to Rabaul) while half-conscious and blind in one eye.
</li><li> An Israeli F-15 fighter landed on one wing after the other was destroyed in a midair collision. The pilot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">unable to see what was going on</a> due to oil and smoke, did not eject as ordered but continued to fly on the plane's aerodynamic undersurfaces. Reportedly, he was demoted for insubordination and instantly promoted back for outstanding flying.
</li><li> An F-106 Delta Dart got into a (normally unrecoverable) flat spin over Montana. The pilot, knowing the plane was lost, ejected. The force of the ejection knocked the plane out of its spin, and it coasted to a wheels-up landing in a farmer's field. It was repaired, continued to fly, and is now in the US Air Force Museum.
</li><li> Belive it or not in 45% of "hull loss incidents" (i.e. the plane gets damaged so much it has to be scrapped due to damages) the number of fatalities is zero.
</li><li> Occasionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">one person</a> or a few people will survive a crash that's officially classified as "unsurvivable".
<ul><li> Juliane Koepcke. Your average 17-year-old German girl. On her way to visit her father, her plane crashed. As in broke apart in mid-air. Right over the Amazon Rain Forest. She fell 10,000 feet partially conscious in her seat. It took her several days, but despite her serious injuries, she was the only one to walk out of the jungle alive. She was so tough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog">Werner Herzog</a> even made a documentary about her.
</li><li> Bahia Bakari was 12 years old when <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenia_Flight_626">the plane she was in<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> crashed in the Indian Ocean on approach to its destination. Barely able to swim and without a life vest (to say nothing of being very, very mentally traumatized) she managed to cling to a piece of wreckage for 9 hours before finally being rescued as the sole survivor of the accident.
</li><li> Four-year-old Cecelia Cichan was the sole survivor of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_255">another horrific plane crash<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Investigators speculated that her survival might have been due to her small size, which meant she was more protected by her seat than an adult in a seat of the same size.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope played out with tragic consequences in the case of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123">Japan Airlines Flight 123<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Convinced that no one could have survived the crash, Japanese authorities weren't as expedient in getting to the scene as they might have been. It turned out that a small number of people <em>had</em> survived the initial impact, but many of those died from their injuries before help arrived. Even then, four people were rescued alive from the wreckage.

He'd gained the yellow jersey in the previous stage and was racing to defend it, but in doing so he lost control of his bike and fell down a 70-meter ravine. He survived the fall with only minor injuries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">thanks to some trees breaking his fall</a>. He actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">got back to the racecourse and finished the stage</a>, but abandoned the Tour shortly thereafter at the behest of his team. He would race in later Tours.
</li><li> A Navy crewman once survived being sucked into a jet engine. He survived thanks to his helmet which jammed the engine and caused it to slow down. Here is a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2v1Pgpzp88">documentary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about his survival.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wk6f');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3wk6f" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wk6f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Do note, however, that this is surviving being sucked <em>into</em>, not <em>through</em>, a jet engine.

</li><li> The Chernobyl Divers (Alexei Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov) all volunteered to go down to Chernobyl's flooded basement to open the bubbler pool sluice gates and allow the basement to be drained before it could cause a catastrophic steam explosion. Despite the basement being hellishly radioactive and everyone considering it to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission">Suicide Mission</a>, all three lived. Baranov died in 2005 of a heart attack, while the other two lived to receive medals from Ukraine for their bravery.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, one of the US Navy's advantages was that its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageControl">Damage Control</a> procedures were so capable in dealing with weapons fire hits that the the Imperial Japanese Navy occasionally mistook ships they previously hit as separate ships, such as the USS <em>Yorktown</em>, because the Japanese continually underestimated how durable US Navy ships were.
