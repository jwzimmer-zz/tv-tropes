</p><p>The hero has been affronted. Or the villain has. Or someone has dragged the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> into some dangerous situation against her will.

Or it's a rival situation and "this town ain't big enough for the both of us."
</p><p>Whatever the situation, sitting down rationally and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">talking out the differences</a> is just not going to settle things. No, the only way the offended party feels they can have satisfaction is with a Duel to the Death &mdash; nothing else will do! So, after striking the offending person upside the head with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloveSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloveSlap">glove</a> [horseshoe, brick, or rock optional] to announce your intent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingDownTheGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingDownTheGauntlet">possibly doing so in public</a>, it's time to choose your weapons!

</li><li> Guns
</li><li> Martial Arts

Villains, of course, will try to do so anyway. If one character lacks a weapon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveMeASword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveMeASword">Give Me a Sword</a> may ensue &mdash; and other characters may use this to try to stop the duel. Generally, it is the right of the challenged to choose the manner of combat, and it is considered highly improper for the challenger to object to the choice.
</p><p>Sometimes it's a formal "pistols at dawn" duel. Sometimes it's something dictated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> of the city, town, planet, or dimension in which the scene takes place. Sometimes it's just a fight where there's an unspoken certainty that the loser will not be getting up again. Sometimes the location and circumstances of the duel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterestingSituationDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterestingSituationDuel">are quite outrageous.</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>When the hero wins, he will almost always show mercy to his opponent, much to the opponent's humiliation (unless he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> out for revenge, in which case all bets are off). In such cases, the villain may taunt the hero for cowardice or weakness; or he may try to take his own death blow after the duel has officially ended and the hero is walking away, in which case, fifty-fifty, the result will often be the villain getting killed in self-defense (a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a>) or the hero or one of his friends stopping the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a>.
</p><p>When the villain wins, you can count on the villain to strike mercilessly. The other party will die or may have to be rushed to whatever works for first aid/resurrection in this instance. On the other hand, this may be the point of which you learn the other character is not a villain (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetItOverWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetItOverWith">Get It Over With</a> is common).
</p><p>And several duels in media end with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown">the loser having to get out of town</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByFirstBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByFirstBlood">Honor may (theoretically) be satisfied with first blood, or first serious injury</a>. However, because it will be fought with real weapons, any duel can end in death.

</p><p>May overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightClubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightClubbing">Fight Clubbing</a>, where the duel is, arguably, for fun. At least the spectator's fun. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenPacesAndTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenPacesAndTurn">Ten Paces and Turn</a>.

</p><p>There are lesser variations, and greater ones beyond simply "to the death."

The most noticeable one was probably Udo Jin-e, a psychopathic killer who was a fellow assassin (though on the opposite side) during the revolution. After Kenshin prevents an assassination, he tries to put Kenshin in a situation where he HAS to kill him in order to save Kaoru, but when it doesn't work and he's left defeated but alive, he simply commits Sepukku, all while stating that he's going to watch Kenshin from hell to see him kill someone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> featured several memorable duels in all series of the franchise: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> between Kouji Kabuto and Dr. Hell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> (manga version), the final dog fight between Duke Fleed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Blackie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em>, the battle between Kouji Kabuto and a mechanized Baron Ashura in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em>... but the most famous and most memorable was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight">Sword Fight</a> between Tetsuya Tsurugi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Great General of Darkness / Ankoku Daishogun in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>, Akuma always fights to the death, though it's somewhat averted in that he never challenges anyone (he only takes challenges from worthy opponents), and ends up sparing loads of people anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo">Samurai Deeper Kyo</a></em> has, near the end, a duel to the death between Kyo (in Kyoshiro's body) and Kyoshiro (in Kyo's body). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately subverted, Kyoshiro gives Kyo his body back before the final blow is stuck and Kyo, rather than stay indebted with him or making him look better than him, heals his wounds.</span>

Asakura seems to terminally injure Yuki with the latter having apparently made no attempt to attack. It transpires that Yuki has been on the attack in a different way, breaking through Asakura's data barriers in order to terminate Asakura's data link, effectively deleting her from the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Corsair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Corsair">Corsair</a></em>, Shirokko hates Canale, who is a blind pacifist and therefore useless as a pirate, and keeps trying to challenge him to one for any reason, hoping to be rid of him. When Canale finally is forced to duel him and beats him (being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">former assassin</a>), Shirokko is rather stunned.

In both versions, one dueler collapses due to shock from an injury from an explosion on Desslok's ship, rendering a duel unnecessary.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, this is what happened between Akainu and Aokiji during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. The two had the first-ever feud between Admirals, and it was over the Fleet Admiral position. The conflict escalated to the point of a <em>death match</em> on the barren island of Punk Hazard, lasting ten days and permanently altering the climate of the island, making one half a frozen wasteland, the other half permanently on fire. In the end, the winner was Akainu, but, in a rare moment of sympathy, spared Aokiji's life, and the latter proceeded to ditch the marines, not wanting to serve under Akainu.

Outraged at being this perceived dishonor, Ashuramaru would later join the Dark Axis and track Bakunetsumaru down in Neotopia, this time making sure their next duel's for keeps.

Despite being completely outmatched in terms of raw strength and getting curb-stomped for the first half of the match, Nagisa manages to win the duel by using an unorthodox assassination technique that gives him a big enough opening to immobilize him in a single move. Instead of killing him, Nagisa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">coldly smiles</a> as he delivers the finishing blow, an act that drives Takaoka to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">brink of insanity</a> as he's rendered unconscious.

During the battle, Ichigo struggles to find the resolve to gain a killer instinct that desires to seek battle and crush his enemies, and as a result, his Hollow forces visions of past warriors Ichigo has defeated as tests for him to overcome this issue. The climax of this inner struggle comes when Ichigo faces Kenpachi who Ichigo claims that they settled things from their last battle now that they're friends, but Kenpachi claims that nothing about a battle is settled until one side is dead. Kenpachi further clarifies that if Ichigo desires power then it is inevitable that he seek out battle and not shy away from it, that men like them were born to love fighting and to continue fighting in order to gain more power. Basically Kenpachi speaks of a spirited warrior who craves battles to the death.

</li></ul></li><li> The fourth novel of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series goes as far as to allude to it in the title, <em>Field of Dishonor</em>. Dueling is legal in the Star Kingdom of Manticore and tends to be used by the aristocracy more often than the commoners. On Grayson it goes far enough you can request a trial by combat against the Protector's champion.
<ul><li> Honor engages in two of these in <em>Field Of Dishonor</em>, the first being against a professional duelist who killed her lover in a duel to goad her into challenging him, on the assumption that, as a Naval officer, she wouldn't have the same level of skill as he does. Unfortunately for him, her uncle's involvement in the Beowulf Society for Creative Anachronism made her very familiar with the chemical-propellant guns used in duels, and her genetic enhancements and cybernetic eye sharpened her hand-eye co-ordination to the point that she could simply shoot from the hip. The end result was that she hit her opponent four times before he could even raise his gun.
</li><li> The second duel in <em>Field of Dishonor</em> was against the man who hired the previous duelist, a cowardly, amoral aristocrat. He was so terrified that he turned and fired early... but failed to kill Honor. He was promptly splattered by both Honor and the Marshall of the Field. She is later heavily criticized by aristocrats for, in their opinion, shooting an unarmed man (he had expended all his ammo by that point), conveniently ignoring that the moment he violated the rules of the duel, his life was legally forfeit. Even if Honor hadn't fired, the Marshall would still have killed him on the spot.
</li><li> In <em>Flag in Exile</em>, Honor, badly injured in a shuttle crash, is forced to engage in a sword duel against a Grayson Steadholder. Despite his greater experience in swordsmanship, she cuts him down with contemptuous ease - he had the mindset of a sport fencer, not a hardened killer like Honor, and wasn't mentally prepared for a battle to the death. It should be noted that Grayson swordsmanship is of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">Single-Stroke Battle</a> variety since it's based entirely around the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenSamurai">Seven Samurai</a></em>.
</li><li> It's mentioned that there are two protocols for duels on Manticore. One is of the "first blood" variety, although death is still possible. The other is of the "until one is dead or both are out of ammo" variety.

One is between Tavi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Navaris</a>, who hopelessly outclasses him but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages">a little too psycho for her own good</a>; Tavi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speeches</a> her into making a mistake in a fit of blind rage.

<ul><li> An interesting factor is that while the <em>juris macto</em> is mentioned lots of times, it only actually happens twice over the course of six books. Apparently implying that you will haul someone outside and kill them if they don't shut up is enough to make all but the most arrogant or desperate consider other options.
</li><li> The <em>juris macto</em> comes with another interesting caveat: The challenged can have a champion fight on their behalf, but the challenger cannot. This serves to radically shrink the number that happen since a High Lord or elite metalcrafter might well step in on behalf of the defendant if they're convinced of his innocence.
</li><li> One epic duel we don't get to see was the legendary one between Aldrick ex Gladius and Araris Valerian. These two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsmen</a> went for ten hours <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0twsu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0twsu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0twsu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Their metalcraft allows them to ignore pain and go days at a time without sleeping</span> in Alera Imperia, where something like 50,000 people turned out to see it.
</li><li> The <em>juris macto</em> has an interesting legal implication as well: A non-Citizen can become a Citizen by challenging and defeating them, as we learn in the backstory of High Lady Placida, who killed the brother of a High Lord to gain her Citizenship. A <em>juris macto</em> can also be non-fatal, as witnessed in <em>Academ's Fury</em> and the duel between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">High Lord Kalarus</a> and his son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">Brencis</a>, which gained Brencis his Citizenship.

Unfortunately, a rival of the victim's found out and shot him with a rifle loaded with a musket ball.

By Earth-19 law, someone can challenge a Collector (like Gypsy) to a duel. It's only after Cisco challenges Gypsy that he's told that the duel is to the death. Unlike him, Gypsy has full control of her powers (identical to his), while he still needs his glasses and amplifier gloves. He also has very little combat experience, while she is a highly-trained officer of the law. However, Julian manages to analyze a video of their initial fight and determines that Gypsy has a predictable vulnerability. During the duel, they engage in some dimension-hopping, before Gypsy prepares to use her special move. Cisco remembers the vulnerability and manages to catch Gypsy off-guard, knocking her to the ground and hurts her a little, before sparing her life in exchange for H.R.'s.

The problem is that Barin is a warrior and has been trained to use the weapon, while Flash is a marathon runner from Earth with few hand-to-hand combat skills. Quickly disarming Flash, Barin prepares to finish him off, but can't. Instead, he throws the weapon at Ming, who goes down from the poison. Aura then reveals that she has replaced the poison in the weapons with a fast-acting sedative meant to simulate death and that Ming will be very angry when he wakes up.

Knowing the rules of the League, Rip challenges Ra's al Ghul to a duel for the fate of the prisoners. Presumably, Rip has no intention of actually killing Ra's decades before his fated death at Oliver's hands, but he probably assumes that Ra's can be healed in the Lazarus Pit. However, unknown to Rip, both he and Ra's are able to choose a challenger to take their place. Ra's chooses Sara. Reworking his plan, Rip chooses Kendra, Sara's friend and frequent sparring partner, hoping that Kendra can reach Sara during the fight. It works. Sara bests Kendra but snaps back before dealing the killing blow. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then Chronos attacks, and the duel is forgotten</span>.

The other one can't be beaten normally and almost kills Cameron, but Daniel ends up shooting the holo-projector.

As Cameron is accused of killing one of their tribesman (the guy is actually alive at SGC), he is told that he will be executed by allowing a family member of the deceased to fight him. Being fair, they send one of their own to teach Cameron their martial art. When it comes time for the duel, Cam finds out that his teacher is the brother of the "deceased" and his opponent. Despite his military training and the new skills, the brother easily beats Cam and pretends to kill him.
</li><li> The audiodrama <em>First Prime</em> has Teal'c being forced to fight in a duel with Sebe't, a former friend and the new First Prime of Apophis. Sebe't uses a device called "altir", which is a pair of orbs that are typically attached to the temples of gladiators that allow them to scan each other's surface thoughts and which can be used to deliver electrical shocks to the wearer. Sebe't is able to use the device to outmaneuver Teal'c and beat the crap out of him, so Teal'c flees and uses "kelno'reem" to hide his thoughts. At the end, he uses the "altir" to show Sebe't the truth about his wife Li'tel's death: her death wasn't an accident, she jumped off a bridge after Apophis forced her to be his mistress and then discarded her. Teal'c witnessed it but was ordered to lie to Sebe't. Sebe't renounces Apophis and is killed when an electric shock is delivered through the device.

When de Lombard challenges this man to a duel for insulting Voltaire, Voltaire says he must fight to the death for the man's right to say Voltaire wouldn't fight to the death. When de Lombard says this is stupid, Voltaire agrees and backs down.

<ul><li> Common among the Imperium, Chaos, and Dark Eldar in <em>Extremely</em> common, if informal, among the Orks.
</li><li> "Informal" in this case roughly translates to "only when shooting them in the back with your favourite gun doesn't kill them instantly".
</li><li> This was given an explicit rule, "Challenge", in Sixth edition: if two squads each have an upgraded/attached unit such as a sergeant, or if one squad is an independent character all on their own, then when they close for melee combat the attackers can issue a challenge to the defenders. If the challenge is accepted, each duelist can ONLY affect the other (useful when one tends to make a lot of attacks per round and could wipe out a squad); if rejected, the defending champion can't take part in that round of combat (still potentially useful, in cases where one unit can't take out the attacking character but the whole squad can).
</li><li> Lucius the Eternal tends to only fight to his full ability when he's called one of these. With a sword and whip. Likely against someone with a big gun.
</li><li> Ogres combine this with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingContest">Eating Contest</a>; the winner gets to eat the loser.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> isn't too far behind, with Empire, Dark Elves, Orcs, Chaos, and Ogres all engaging in this to some extent.
<ul><li> Ogres in particularly are big believers in it; leadership of a tribe only changes with the death of the current Tyrant. Sometimes this is of fairly natural causes (the legendary Tyrant Olflab Stonecruncher Fatgut Deathcheater choking to death on his great-grandson's skull after ruling for over 90 years, for example). Most commonly, a "guts out pit-fight", where two ogres fight to the death with their bare hands and the winner eats the loser, is what determines a change of power.
</li></ul></li><li> This is half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wulfrik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wulfrik">Wulfrik</a> the Wanderer's shtick, going around challenging people whose head the Chaos gods want on a stick (read: important units the player wants dead but are safely hidden behind bodyguards). The other part is his Gift of Tongues, which allows him to speak every single language there is and ensure the challenge is unrefusable, because it takes the form of a long string of unsubtle insults that enrage the target into accepting the challenge even if it's an obviously stupid idea (such as leaving the walls of a fortress to ride out and fight him).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Rokugan's</a> culture favors contests of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IaijutsuPractitioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IaijutsuPractitioner">iaijutsu</a> when it comes down to two bushi having a personal clash. That said, the parties involved require special dispensation from their lords in order to fully realize this trope&mdash;their lives are not for themselves to choose to throw away, after all. Normally, such duels are thus merely to first blood.
</li><li> A deeply rooted part of Clan warrior culture in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> universe. Not only is it fairly common to settle disagreements with duels (not always to the death, but few Clanners blink an eye if it happens as long as nobody cheated), but it also constitutes the appeals process in the courts, is essential to the promotion process, and is mandatory to participate in the political process, where earning the right to vote requires you to be the winner of a 24-man dueling tournament. The attitude goes so far that ganging up on a single enemy <em>in actual combat</em> is considered a breach of the rules of warfare, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">an odd man out will wait until his comrade is killed, and then engage the now "free" enemy</a>. In essence, a properly fought Clan v Clan war is the sum total of numerous individual duels. The Inner Sphere, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">the Inner Sphere</a>, exploited this mercilessly and tended to manage to win fights where they were technologically outmatched by fighting completely unfairly when the Clans expected fair fights.

After 4 merchants have Elric of Melnibon&eacute; kill Nikorn, one way for Nikorn's daughter Freya to get revenge is to challenge each of the merchants to a duel. If she takes too long dealing with them, one of the merchants will seek her out for a duel. In the sequel <em>Black Sword</em>, Freya can duel Elric himself.

Though such duels are a perfectly legitimate means to settle disputes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Redguard</a> society, Cyrus is the son of a prominent Crown (a conservative Redguard political party with ties to old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Yokudan</a> nobility) while Hakan is one of the leaders of the Forebears (a more progressive Redguard political party with ties to the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Warrior Wave</a>" of Redguards who first settled Hammerfell and made it safe for the rest of the Yokudans to settle there). The Crowns and Forebears are violently opposed, and Hakan marrying Iszara was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> to hopefully bring peace. Thus, Cyrus was forced to flee, becoming a pirate.

This led him to believe that he was invincible, causing him to retire to Mount Hattu where he would write the Book of Circles to pass along his insights.
</li><li> Also from the backstory, King Joile of Daggerfall convinced Gaiden Shinji, the legendary Redguard hero and leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">Order of Diagna</a>, to join him in the Siege of Orsinium (the home city-state/fortress of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a>). Joile then convinced Shinji, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Blademaster</a> and founder of the Imperial City <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorSubquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorSubquest">Arena</a>, to participate in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion">Combat by Champion</a>-style Duel To The Death against the Orc leader, Baloth Bloodtusk. As Shinji and Baloth were fighting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryBetrayal">Joile ordered his archers to open fire on both of them</a>, killing them both. As it turned out, Joile not only wanted to sack Orsinium but planned to invade Hammerfell after and knew that Shinji would have been a major obstacle. (Joile would get his comeuppance, dying during what would be a failed invasion of Hammerfell.)

At the end of the war, he battled the Ayleid leader, Umaril the Unfeathered, in this fashion. He defeated, but could not kill, Umaril who had divine protection from the Daedric Prince Meridia.

The player can agree to fight him fairly, send their entire party after him, talk him out of the fight, or force the fight to a draw by retreating into the market, causing the knight to call off the fight and swear vengeance later.
<ul><li> You also get to fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loghain</span> in a duel to the death, though you can choose a champion in that duel.

During Thrall's reign, the mak'gora wasn't fought to the death, but Garrosh re-established the rule "Lok'tar Ogar", Victory or Death. There have been many notable mak'goras throughout history:
<ul><li> Orgrim Doomhammer challenging the Warchief Blackhand in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> game. After learning how Blackhand was a pawn to Gul'dan, Orgrim challenged Blackhand and killed him, becoming the new Warchief.
</li><li> Garrosh challenges Thrall after the events on Outland over Thrall's tolerance with the Alliance. The duel was never finished since the Scourge attacked Ogrimmar during their battle.
</li><li> Cairne challenges Garrosh for what he believes to be a betrayal on Garrosh's part(actually manipulation from the Twilight's Hammer cult). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">While it doesn't happen in-game</a> it's widely referenced in-game. Garrosh's weapon was poisoned by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> without his knowledge, so Cairne was paralyzed as soon as Garrosh barely scratched him. He was then killed by Garrosh. It was believed by many, Garrosh included, that Cairne would have won the duel had he not be betrayed so.
</li><li> During <em>War Crimes,</em> which chronicles Garrosh Hellscream's trial after he goes off the deep end and is subsequently defeated by the Alliance and a Horde uprising, Saurfang, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">seasoned orc veteran</a>, expresses distaste that Hellscream is being tried by foreigners in a foreign land and that if it were up to him, he would have challenged Hellscream to a mak'gora. Saurfang, despite his age, would most likely have won this duel easily.
</li><li> In <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, Thrall challenges Garrosh. Garrosh gains the upper hand at first, but then Thrall unleashes his shaman magic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thrall wins, and Garrosh loses his life. This has consequences in <em>Legion</em>. Because of everything Garrosh did since Thrall put him in control of the Horde, Thrall suffered a great deal of emotional turmoil after all was said and done. So much so that he lost his connection to the elements and so lost his shamanistic powers.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Battle for Azeroth</em>, Varok Saurfang challenges Sylvanas Windrunner after she proves how monstrous she's become and what direction she was taking the Horde. Sylvanas dominates the fight, but Varok manages to scratch her face while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">declaring she's a failure who will never break the Horde</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> where she angrily declares the Horde is <em>nothing</em> to her, which instantly turns everyone including the Forsaken against her.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar">Empire: Total War</a></em>, a Western faction's gentleman character can challenge or be challenged to duel another character (not necessarily another gentleman). The cutscene shows a duel either using swords or pistols. Interestingly, the duel is not always lethal, meaning both characters can survive with their honor satisfied. The cutscene will then show both characters walking past each other (one of them bandaged), nodding in respect.
<ul><li> The intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2">Total War: Shogun 2</a></em> shows a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion">Combat by Champion</a> between a samurai from an army besieging a city with the city's champion.

<ul><li> Most <em>Metal Gear</em> games in general end with a one-on-one duel. There are more bosses who <em>don't</em> bring mooks to back them up than there are that do.

<ul><li> Dueling (of the type we think of today) originates from the time period when a squabble between two men could easily and rapidly blow up into a huge, ruinous family feud. Dueling contained the dispute between two/four men and kept collateral damage to a minimum. However, duels to the death have always been relatively rare. First blood, or in the case of pistols, one-shot, duels have always been more common. Even in a place as notoriously rough-and-tumble as 17th century Venice, only one in forty duels ended in the death of either combatant and even then deaths were more the result of unlucky first cuts than anything else. And in pistol duels it was common for one or both duelists to shoot into the air or into the ground at the feet of their opponent; willingness to risk one's life in the duel was supposed to be sufficient for honor to be satisfied. When a duel was <em>intentionally</em> to the death, it was usually because a feud between the participants went deeper than just the specific dispute that was officially the subject of the duel.
</li><li> American history has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> vs. Aaron Burr duel. As a classic early-19th-century pistol duel, it would not have been socially expected to have been to the death, but one or both parties may have intended it to be nonetheless. This one is so steeped in personal enmity and political rivalry, and is of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">such importance to the history of the United States</a>, it <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr-Hamilton_duel">gets its own article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was also challenged to a duel at one point. He thought that the idea of dueling was absurd and initially chose cow pies as the weapon. When the challenger told him to take the challenge seriously, Lincoln then requested that it be fought in a pit with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">cavalry broadswords</a></em>. Lincoln particularly insisted that the pit have a plank across the middle that neither man could cross. Then, just before the duel, Lincoln cleared some branches with his sword. Realizing that Lincoln had at least six inches' greater reach, his opponent ended up chickening out.

The duel itself - where the two men did not harm each other after two shots apiece - was a tame affair. The aftermath between the two groups that supported each duelist was bloodier, when they approached each other one side opened fire and they began a close-range brawl. The Sandbar Fight became famous because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Jim Bowie</a> - a target of the brawl - barely survived it with various gunshot wounds while taking out three men (killing one) with his famous knife.

In one particular duel, Jackson knew his opponent was a better shot, and let him fire first. The bullet lodged in his chest but was not fatal. Because pistols back then could only be fired once before reloading, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Jackson had all the time in the world to aim his shot</a>.
</li><li> British history has two famous ones from the early 19th century:
<ul><li> The 1809 duel between Lord Castlereagh and George Canning. Both men were leading Cabinet ministers in the Tory government of the Duke of Portland (Castlereagh was War Secretary and Canning was Foreign Secretary). As the Napoleonic Wars were ongoing, they were chiefly fighting over military strategy, but also who would succeed the ailing Portland: the proximate cause of the duel was that Castlereagh discovered that Portland had secretly agreed to kick him out of Cabinet and replace him with Lord Wellesley<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28rz0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28rz0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28rz0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Duke of Wellington's older brother Richard</span> when the political moment was right. Castlereagh won the duel (Canning, who had never shot a pistol in his life, fired wide, while Castlereagh hit Canning square in the thigh), but ultimately neither man succeeded Portland (the job went to Spencer Perceval instead).
</li><li> The 1829 duel between the Duke of Wellington and the Earl of Winchilsea. The Duke was Prime Minister at the time; Winchilsea had written a letter harshly criticising Wellington for allowing the passage of the Catholic Relief Bill (neither Wellington nor Winchilsea were fans of Catholic Emancipation, but Wellington felt it politically necessary to avoid civil unrest). The Duke missed (deliberately, he claimed, although he was such a notoriously bad shot that this might be face-saving); Winchilsea fired into the air and apologised for the harshness of his language.
</li></ul></li><li> A particularly famous 16th-century French duel was waged after the young, minor nobleman Guy de Chabot, Baron of Jarnac, quarreled with the Dauphin (the heir apparent to the throne). Because the Dauphin was too important to duel himself, the veteran soldier and highly skilled duelist Fran&ccedil;ois Vivonne stood in his place. Knowing that he had little hope of defeating Vivonne, Jarnac hired the services of the Italian fencing master Captain Caize, who trained him to perfect a little-used cut to the back of the knee. On the day of the duel, Jarnac quickly landed two blows on Vivonne's legs, crippling him. The enraged king ended the duel immediately. Vivonne refused medical attention and eventually bled to death. The duel shocked the French court due to the unexpected result, the ease at which Jarnac seemed to win, and the bad implication it had on the royal family. Dueling was quickly outlawed in France thereafter. To this day, a <em>Coup de Jarnac</em> is a tricky or unexpected attack.
</li><li> In his youth as acting editor of the New York Sunday Mercury, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> challenged the editor of a rival newspaper to a duel. The duel itself was narrowly averted after Twain's second exaggerated his marksmanship, prompted the rival's second to advise him to call off the duel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RidleyScott">Ridley Scott</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDuellists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDuellists">The Duellists</a></em> was based on a true story - in France, 1794; a young officer named Dupont was ordered to deliver an insulting message to Fournier, a fellow officer. Fournier took out his rage over the letter by challenging Dupont to a duel, which ended without a clear victor, as did the next, and the next and so on. They fought <em>thirty</em> duels over the next nineteen years. Eventually Dupont grew so irritated at repeatedly being challenged that he refused to fire in a pistol duel, instead telling Fournier (who had fired and missed twice) than if he ever challenged him again he would first fire his two reserved shots.
<ul><li> Fournier was a violent and quarrelsome fellow, so his life was full of other duels with countless other people. The Spaniards didn't call him <em>El Demonio</em> for nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> Mathematician &Eacute;variste Galois died in a duel at the age of twenty, leaving behind writings that provided much of the foundation of group theory.
</li><li> The great Russian poet and writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a> was very touchy about his own honor, but rather disrespectful about others. As a result, he fought a great number of duels. He was eventually killed by Georges d'Anthes, husband to his wife's sister, over rumors that d'Anthes was having an affair with Pushkin's wife.
</li><li> A few years later, another Russian poet, Mikhail Lermontov, met his end when, while serving in the Army, one of his fellow soldiers didn't like a joke he had told. They dueled, and Lermontov was shortly dead.
</li><li> The last recorded judicial duel in France was fought in 1386. Interestingly it was allowed, not because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> at the time thought it appropriate practice but simply because they hadn't bothered to take it off the books! A French noblewoman conceived while her husband was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlBackHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlBackHome">away at war</a>. She claimed it was rape by a political rival of her husband's. Her husband appeared as plaintiff and slew the defendant.
</li><li> In 1818, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_v_Thornton">an Englishman<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was accused of murder and claimed the right to trial by combat. To everyone's surprise, the law granting him that right was still valid, and he was acquitted when his accuser declined to appear on the "field of honor." Trial by combat was abolished the next year.
</li><li> Germany's last Kaiser, Wilhellm II, was very temperamental and often challenged people to duels. One of the main ways his opponents avoided them was by setting very strange rules. One rather intelligent army officer proposed a duel using field artillery, at 30 meters.
</li><li> Otto von Bismark once challenged <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Virchow#The_Sausage_Duel">Rudolf Virchow<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to a duel over a political dispute. Allegedly, Virchow chose sausages as his weapon: One was infected with deadly botulism, one was not. The Chancellor decided that he didn't want to risk eating a toxic sausage and withdrew the challenge.
</li><li> Two rather famous hunters once challenged each other to a duel at 400 meters with rifles with each fighter at the other end of a cliff split by a deep river. The duel lasted over a month since each would carefully camouflage themselves after firing.
</li><li> Preston Brooks gained infamy for bludgeoning Senator Charles Sumner half to death on the floor of the Senate after deciding that the man was not his social equal and did not deserve to be called out to a duel. Another congressman, Anson Burlingame of New York, accused Brooks of cowardice for his actions and received a prompt challenge by Brooks. Burlingame, a marksman, accepted the duel and chose <em>rifles</em>. To avoid anti-dueling laws, he demanded that the duel be held in Canada. Surprised by Burlingame's enthusiasm for the duel and aware of his reputation as a crack shot, Brooks claimed that he did not want to go into "hostile territory" to reach Canada, so he withdrew the challenge. The North mocked him for a coward for the rest of his life.
</li><li> Frederick The Great's father once almost challenged the King of England to a duel, commenting that it was a personal quarrel that should be handled personally rather than risking the lives of their respective subjects. It was unseemly - a bit of Common Sense which very few monarchs seem to have for some reason. The diplomats scotched that plan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> and Olympic fencer Aldo Nadi engaged in a legitimate and very illegal duel with a rival in his youth, sometime in the 1920s. Both participants were wounded several times, and Nadi refused repeated requests from his friends to end the duel. Finally his opponent simply lowered his sword and walked forward with arm extended, as you would at the end of a fencing match, to bring the episode to a close before someone got seriously injured.
</li><li> Two Frenchmen once fought a duel in hot air balloons over Paris. The winner punctured his opponent's balloon, causing the loser and his second to fall to their deaths.
</li><li> Two other Frenchmen fought a duel in which they threw billiard balls at each other. The outcome of the duel is unfortunately unknown.
</li><li> In 1967 Gaston Differre mayor of Marseilles and R. Ribbere majority leader met on the field of honor over a political insult with swords to first blood. To avoid having the police spoil the fun, Differre was smuggled in the trunk of a car.
</li><li> At one time in his career Theodore Herzl the founder of the Zionist movement wanted dueling to be legal in the new state to emphasize that Israelis could be as, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassIsraeli">Badass</a> as any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race</a> around.
</li><li> A variation of this was once used by warriors in India to avoid the shame of dying in their beds. A lord would pick one of his retinues to give him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a>.
</li><li> The Yanomami of South America have a dueling code of their own which has been commented on by anthropologists. It is as elaborate as the various European versions with gradations of danger according to the seriousness of the affront. Similar regulated combats are in fact not unknown among low-tech peoples and are perhaps the source of the hyperbolic of such peoples as only having ritualized warfare.
</li><li> Dueling <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37xpb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note37xpb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37xpb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">defined in this case as a pre-arranged fight with deadly weapons for personal reasons</span> is specifically forbidden in the United States armed forces, per Article 114 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Turns out, your soldiers shooting each other over personal feuds is considered detrimental to discipline and combat effectiveness. A soldier can be put before a court-martial under this Article not only for having an active part in the duel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation">but also for knowing about it and failing to report it to the authorities.</a>
</li><li> In post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> France, an American intelligence officer was challenged by a member of the French aristocracy. His reputation meant he had to accept, but the American ambassador heard of this and threatened to fire him if he did. He resolved the dilemma by naming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">tanks</a> as his choice of weapon.
</li><li> A duel between two British Army officers - in July 2016 - using flares in lieu of pistols resulted in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forces.tv/98339400">burning down the Officers' Mess at their base in Dorset<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
