There are some bosses in gaming that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">more difficult than the creators expect</a>...and then there's this guy. He's not quite pathetic enough to go down in one hit from any old attack, and there's no story significance to him being easy, or indeed, any story significance to him at all. In fact, the developers expected people to actually find said character a challenging opponent in some way, but failed.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This is the Breather Boss, the boss enemy that lacks any semblance of challenge or plot importance. They may just have had a predictable and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawExploitation">easy-to-exploit weakness,</a> or they may just be easy due to attack pattern. Nevertheless, they are easy and weak. Simple as that.

<ul><li> The game has the Phantom Train. He can be a decent fight, but he has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">glaring weakness to Phoenix Down</a> that most undead enemies have. He's also notably weak to Sabin's Suplex move, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u84cH_bmTA">often done<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sabin-train-suplex">for the humour value.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Dadaluma is another joke boss in this game. He's less threatening than the standard mooks you find in his respective area.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> has Gi Nattak, who is easily beaten by one or two Phoenix Downs, and Palmer, who is simply a pushover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> has Gerogero, who is also easily defeated by Phoenix Downs... and, if you master the Junction system, most guardians of Ultimecia's Castle will also be pushovers.
<ul><li> The same game has Abbadon, an undead boss. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">Just hit him with a Phoenix Down every couple of minutes</a> and keep drawing magic from him if you need to stock up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> has Soulcage, who has some pretty tough attacks(notably Mustard Bomb), and some fairly valuable items to steal. Once you have all three items, just hit him with a Phoenix Down, and then the next hit(even Eiko, your weakest physical attacker at that point) will take him out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Manticore, one of three final bosses in World 1, is an example. It comes after the Soul Cannon, which can fire a powerful all-hitting electrical attack if not killed quickly enough, and Archeoaevis, which has lots of HP, powerful attacks, and can change its elemental weakness. Conversely, Manticore lacks immunities to most status effects, has only 3300 HP (Archeoaevis had roughly 10,000), and lacks any really powerful moves.
</li><li> The Titan, another of the final World 1 Bosses, is a borderline example. His Earthshaker attack can be quite powerful; however, you can control the Gaelicat enemy on North Mountain and make it cast Float on you, effectively negating it. He has only 2500 HP, but the relative difficulty in finding Float before World 2 might place him slightly above breather boss level.
</li><li> In the last dungeon, the first boss the player encounters after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Omega</a>'s territory is Apanda, who is incredibly weak against fire and trembles in fear if you summon Ifrit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> is a no-rules fight against three corrupt judges (special units whose stats are derived from the Paladin job). All they've got are a bunch of endgame gear and pitiful melee attacks. You, on the other hand, have Marche, Cid, and 4 other units on your side; plus the fact that you've just beaten a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">better final boss</a> who has the ability to wipe your entire party in an instant. Also, at this point, you should have amassed all of the best equipment and abilities in the game. Can you say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>?
</li><li> There is one boss battle in the main storyline that can be incredibly easy, even though Marche is alone. All you have to do is KO Babus before you get to the crystal smashing. Failing that, there is an easily available robe that nullifies Babus' spells, which most of Marche's jobs can equip. If you ignore Babus, this could turn him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
</li><li> There is another battle that can also be extremely easy, or another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. The boss can charm your allies to make them fight each other, but if you fight it on a day charming is against the law it won't use this attack, making it trivially easy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> has Evrae Altana, who... wait for it... goes down to two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">Phoenix Downs</a>. A few other bosses may also qualify, perhaps most notably the late-game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Seymour</span> Omnis. Not because he's exceptionally easy, but because the previous encounter with him is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. Of course, blowing off the final dungeon for a while can lead to you having level grinded enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> him, so...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>! Carrot, monster malboro and very high-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> is pathetically easy to take down as his/her size actually works against him/her in this game: Putrid Breath, his/her worst weapon, is some seriously bad mojo that inflicts almost every debuff in the game on you&mdash;however, you've seen it before; the Cassies and the Vivians have it. It's an area-of-effect ability that radiates out from the center of the malboro and is notable for having probably the smallest area affected of any spell in the game. As a result, because Carrot is so huge, he/she <em>cannot</em> target all characters with it at once&mdash;so <em>if</em> the ability connects on the <em>one</em> character Carrot can target, one of the other characters just tosses a Remedy at them (Coming across Remedies at this point in the game is not an issue and besides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">what player would knowingly take on a malboro, of all things, without a stock?</a>) and the fight proceeds with barely a hiccup. Come on, Carrot, that was just disgraceful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>
<ul><li> Cape Westwind pits you against, essentially, an ordinary Garlean &mdash; with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>, yes, but magitek is common in Garlemald and Rihtahtyn sas Arvina's isn't anything special. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">a bit of an in-joke</a> to act like the fight is super-difficult when you queue into it via Duty Roulette.
</li><li> Then there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Thordan and his Knights</span> at the climax of Heavensward. Compared to some other boss fights, it's just... not really very dangerous or complicated.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight">Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light</a></em>'s Belphegor is the easiest of the demon bosses. Most of them have more than one elemental spell to guard against and numerous dirty tricks, but Belphegor's entire skillset is fire-based. With four Flame Shields and an elementalist with Mysterio, you can reduce his maximum damage output to 1. Given that he guards the super-buffing Lux spell (which makes the other demon fights <em>much</em> more manageable), this might be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">Throw the Dog a Bone</a> towards the players.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pok&eacute;mon&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em>
<ul><li> Misty will definitely come under this if you raised both Pikachu and Bulbasaur. One resists Water and both have super-effective moves against Misty's Pokemon. Misty on the other hand has only Water/Normal type movepools. So you probably can get through even if Pikachu/Bulbasaur is 1-3 levels under.
</li><li> Koga (except in Yellow) and Bruno's teams came under this. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>, when Koga was an Elite Four Member, his team still came under this.
</li><li> Giovanni. Last Gym Leader in Kanto, third encounter with him...and you most likely have a Water Pok&eacute;mon to sweep his team (at the very least, you can make that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Tentacool</a> you probably caught on the way to Cinnabar annoying for him by teaching it Surf). He dropped his Kangaskhan for a Dugtrio and another Rhyhorn. In RBY you still have to be careful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Fissure</a>, though (and in Yellow, he keeps his Persian to keep in line with the anime, and the kitty was a critihax machine back in the day).
</li><li> Applies even moreso for Blaine. You're required to have a Pok&eacute;mon with Surf, a powerful and reliable Water move, to even get to the Island and he uses Fire Pokemon.
</li><li> The first, and often the second of the Elite Four is often this. This is fairly reasonable, as you still have three fights to go. However, due to a glitch making a preferred type <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">overpowered</a>, Bruno was even easier, and that's far less reasonable.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>
<ul><li> The ultimate example would have to be Janine, the Fuchsia City Gym Leader in GSC. Her team's levels are lower than the eighth leader of Johto, meaning that by the time you reach her, you team is at least a good ten levels higher.
</li><li> The majority of Kanto Gym Leaders (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Green/Blue</a>) also applies. Most of their Pok&eacute;mon levels are on par, or lower than Lance's (and some of the Elite Four's) Pok&eacute;mon, so an average gamer would be at least five levels higher. For those who played the originals, this is even more obvious with Sabrina, as she (and Psychic Pokemon in general) now has a proper weakness, type-wise. The remakes fixed this by raising the levels of their Pok&eacute;mon to be higher than Lance and his Elite Four.
</li><li> One of the easiest bosses would probably be Jasmine if you have a type advantage. Her team is two Magnemite and a Steelix. Magnemite is an unevolved Pok&eacute;mon, so it can probably be one-shotted by a single Fire-type attack. Steelix is evolved, but unlike what you may think, being part ground-type does not give it any resistance to fire attacks. It might take two hits, depending on your Fire-type's level, but it shouldn't be able to beat you.
</li><li> Even Whitney's Miltank is this once you know what to expect. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">While it has a lot of stuff that threw players off the rails on their first try</a>, they're relatively easy to get around. Attract does not work if you have a female Pok&eacute;mon, and Rollout becomes useless if you lower Miltank's accuracy. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0iqf6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0iqf6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0iqf6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Rollout's power resets if it misses even once, and Rollout's BP starts out pretty low. Some earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a> have accuracy-lowering moves, and one such move comes in the form of a HM move you get earlier. Also Miltank usually comes out last, so Whitney won't be able to switch Miltank out - thus being a sitting duck for stat reduction moves</span>. Furthermore, Miltank does not have any moves to counter Rock or Fighting types. Which calls for either a Pokemon (a female Machop) that you can trade and get from the local department store, or a female Geodude/Graveler/Onix you may have caught and trained earlier for the previous two gyms. The former is a particular silver bullet, because it's easy to level-grind and sweep the gym. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note141oj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note141oj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note141oj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As the female Machop is a traded Pokemon, she earns experience faster, and at this point in the game, you don't have to worry about her disobeying you until she is Lv 30, which is at least 10 levels above Whitney's Miltank.</span>
</li><li> If you want to count legendary Pok&eacute;mon as bosses, Mewtwo is surprisingly easy to catch in Heart Gold and Soul Silver. Initially, its only attacking move is Psycho Cut, and if you have a Dark-type that knows False Swipe, you can just whittle down its HP safely, give it sleep or paralysis, and start tossing Pok&eacute; Balls.

<ul><li> Tate &amp; Liza are pretty easy for being the seventh Gym Leaders. Theirs is a Double Battle, in which they use a Solrock and Lunatone. Both are Rock/Psychic types weak to Water, and Surf can hit both of them at the same time for high damage. Especially Solrock who has very low Special Defense. Solrock may prove itself a problem with its Sunny Day/Solarbeam combo, but it shouldn't be a massive problem with a Grass-type - Shiftry (a Grass/Dark dual-type) immediately springs to mind as a great choice against both Lunatone and Solrock. This is also the case with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> <em>Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yym1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2yym1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yym1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even though Shiftry isn't available in <em>Alpha Sapphire</em> without trading</span>.
</li><li> The final Elite Four Drake can be this. While he had strong Pok&eacute;mon, all of it are weak to ice. With the exception of Shelgon (which is the weakest of his Pok&eacute;mon), they all took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithIce">4x damage</a> against them too. So if you have a strong Ice Pok&eacute;mon or even a strong Pok&eacute;mon who knows Ice Beam, Drake will be easy sweep. Emerald fixed this by replacing one of his Flygon (he has two) with a Kingdra though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl</a></em>:
<ul><li> Byron is a joke if you picked Chimchar. Considering you can get a free TM35 for Flamethrower in the Fuego Ironworks right after you get Surf, or if you're too lazy to do that you can get the TM38 for Fire Blast at the Veilstone Department Store, you can use those along with Close Combat and basically destroy him in three turns. And even if you don't have Chimchar, he's still not that hard at all. His Pok&eacute;mon are light on offense (save Magneton, which Platinum gives him over Bronzor), Steelix dies to a good Water-type with Surf, and Bastiodon is easily susceptible to Fighting and Ground-types like Machamp or Golem. Bronzor might cause some annoyances, but this Gym is nothing compared to Fantina (DP) or Crasher Wake (Platinum) before it.
</li><li> Candice is also made extremely easy by Chimchar, as her Snover and Abomasnow have a big weakness to Fire while her Sneasel has the same weakness to Fighting moves. Chimchar's evolutions are both Fire/Fighting, making this self-explanatory. Even if you didn't pick Chimchar or raise a Ponyta, the only other Fire-type in Sinnoh, the sheer number of weaknesses that her Pok&eacute;mon have still make her a very easy opponent.

This would not be such a problem if her gym didn't come <em>right</em> after a cave with 2 extremely useful electric-type Pok&eacute;mon in it. This is even <em>more</em> true in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pok&eacute;mon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>, as there are even <em>more</em> electric types available beforehand, meaning you basically have no excuse not to run roughshod over her.
</li><li> Burgh is this if you have a decent Fire-type or Flying-type. In fact, his main Pokemon has a double weakness to both.
</li><li> Brycen is also incredibly easy. His Pokemon are all pure Ice-types, which is defensively the worst type in the game, only resisting itself. So long as you don't use Ice-type moves (or Ground-type moves against Cryogonal) you'll always do at least neutral damage, and none of his Pokemon are strong enough to stand up to a super effective attack for too long. Things are made even easier by the fact that most of his team is pretty slow.
</li><li> Out of all the champions in each game, Alder is one of the easiest, which is made worse since in Black and White he's also one of the easiest storyline opponents. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that he is severely out of practice - his fight against Plasma King N had him choke to said opponent's legendary, highly suggesting he was never going to be back in his prime again.
</li><li> In addition to Skyla, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pok&eacute;mon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> also has Marlon. Despite being the final gym leader, all of his Pokemon are weak to grass and electricity, and none of them have any particularly notable stats aside from high HP. He can wall pretty well, but he'll usually have difficulty dealing any high damage unless you send out a bunch of Fire and Ground types for some reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em>:
<ul><li> For all the times you encounter Korrina before her Gym Battle and hear about how strong she is, most players will agree that she doesn't really live up to it. Two of her Pok&eacute;mon are pure Fighting-types, making her the first Gym Leader in the game to fall to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorPredictableRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorPredictableRock">Poor, Predictable Rock</a>. And since these games introduced the new Fairy-type, which is super effective against Fighting, most players made it a point to raise one. Finally, her main Pok&eacute;mon is a Hawlucha, a Pok&eacute;mon that you can encounter in the wild before you even fight her. Also does not help that her Pokemon can only counter Flying-types. It is all the more ironic, as your previous battles with Korrina's Lucario are tougher. If you have a Ghost type on your team, Korrina becomes a complete joke, as none of her Pokemon have moves that can touch Ghost type Pokemon.
</li><li> Ramos can either be this or he can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a> after Korrina. While his Jumpluff and Weepinbell don't seem like much of a threat, his Gogoat can be surprisingly tough and plow through your team if you underestemitate it. But like Korrina, there's not enough type diversity in his team to overcome the overabundant weaknesses of the Grass-type.
</li><li> Olympia starts out strong with a Sigilyph and Slowking, two powerful Psychic-types. Then her trump card turns out to be a Meowstic of all things. You've already fought a Meowstic numerous times thanks to your rival, who you happen to battle <em>right outside of Olympia's gym</em>.
</li><li> Malva of the Elite Four can easily fall into this, as any Water-type with Surf can sweep her entire team of Fire-types with relative ease. Her Pyroar does have Noble Roar, which seems to be intended to overcome this weakness since it's the first Pok&eacute;mon she sends out, so preferably save your Surfer till after you beat it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em>: Specific to <em>Sword</em> is Gordie, the 6th Gym Leader you face. He specializes in the Rock-type, a type with a poor reputation and is normally used by early-game Gym Leaders, and he does very little to compensate for that. All of his Pok&eacute;mon have very exploitable vulnerabilities outside of that too, with Barbaracle having a x4 weakness to Grass, Shuckle having almost no offensive power, Stonjourner having abysmal Special Defense, and Coalossal having a x4 weakness to both Water and Ground, though it does have Steam Engine to boost Speed, which can catch people by surprise. Gordie is a threat only if you allow him to set up; as long as you try to keep the battle brief, there isn't much he can do to you.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36hmh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note36hmh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36hmh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This applies only to his battle at Circhester Stadium, however. In rematches at Wyndon Stadium, he adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Tyranitar</a> to his team, which makes it significantly stronger.</span> This is contrasted with his <em>Shield</em> counterpart Melony, who, despite specializing in the Ice-type which is defensively even worse, can destroy unprepared teams as her Pok&eacute;mon have a lot of tricks to defend themselves against Pok&eacute;mon with type advantages.
</li><li> Going by non-main series games, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pok&eacute;mon Colosseum</a></em> has Gonzap, who comes after a few hard rematches with the Cipher Admins and before the leader of Team Cipher. None of his Pok&eacute;mon are particularly dangerous, and they love to spam Earthquake. Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Dakim</a> however, none of his Pok&eacute;mon can avoid the move except for his Shadow Skarmory, so he usually ends up crippling his team via friendly fire making it easy to pick them off. The only real struggle in this fight is snagging his Skarmory, but even that's more annoying rather than truly difficult.

They do have some annoying attacks and the big dragon head likes to use Ground Dasher, which can easily kill a party member at this point in the game, but they are much easier than the preceeding bosses <em>and</em> the previous dungeon gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Lloyd</a> a weapon that deals extra hard damage to dragons.
</li><li> In the Tower of Salvation, the fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Remiel</span>. Not very fast, a pretty predictable attack pattern and the only really damaging attack, Holy Lance, is rarely used when the boss reaches half HP. A very simple boss at a very dramatic point in the game and a breather, before two more boss battles come. Fortunately, the first one doesn't have to be won and the second is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>.
</li><li> Strangely enough, a breather boss just before a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">difficult</a> one is the duel against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kratos</span> in the Treant Forest. The boss is pretty easy and, while technically already fought two times before, is much easier as he lacks using the more heavy-hitting attacks and spells and has only a fourth of his usual HP.

<ul><li> The first battle against Rideaux. Has a lot less HP and doesn't hit very hard, which is quite nice compared to the last two bosses fought, with both easily going into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">that one category</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has an interesting example: rather than fighting a boss normally, you play <em>Chess</em> with him (not the real chess, it has its own rules). Despite the fact that the boss cheats, it's not hard to win it, but it's certainly a different experience.
<ul><li> Noth the Plaguebringer. He's a fairly easy boss, but, apart from some easily-downed trash, he comes immediately before the dreaded Heigan. Get your dancing shoes on.
</li><li> Ulduar: First, there's Flame Leviathan, a very innovative encounter using vehicles, but he's a complete pushover. Razorscale is not much harder. Then come XT-002 and Ignis who will eat you alive. Similarily there's Auriaya in central Ulduar, who is not particularily difficult except for the pull, that requires high amounts of coordination, but other than that, the boss is rather easy... and immediately followed by the watchers, who are much harder. And Mimiron WILL make you weep in despair.
</li><li> Burning Crusade had the Void Reaver, a slightly beefed up version of the Fel Reavers that run around Hellfire Peninsula and slaughter lower level characters. He was standing in Tempest Keep, where one of the hardest Bosses of all time was found, together with another two fairly difficult encounters... and the Trash before him is effectivly a lot harder than he himself. He could take a beating, but as long as most of the raid pays attention he is ridiculously easy. So easy that it was advised to try him as soon as you could beat a single boss of a lower Tier. They called him "Loot Reaver" for a reason. Void Reaver was inadvertently made a lot harder after he got changed in a patch, though. Originally he was bugged, causing him to shoot his attacks (which you are supposed to run out of the path of) from his feet rather than his head. This was later fixed, which - since he's an insanely tall robot - had the side effect of making these shots impossible to see until they hit you. People had to use scripts to increase the viewing distance beyond the default maximum to work around this.
</li><li> In Icecrown Citadel, Lord Marrowgar and Lady Deathwhisper are quite difficult for players who haven't run through the dungeon very often. Then comes the gunship battle, which is easy enough to be nicknamed the "Lootship" battle, as it basically consists of fighting off adds while shooting the enemy ship with the cannons, and occasionally killing a mage who disables your cannons. The Deathbringer, who comes soon afterward, is a relatively simple DPS race if the raid knows how to deal with Mark of the Fallen Champion. Valithria Dreamwalker, whom many raids go to after the more difficult Plagueworks and Crimson Hall bosses, is quite easy compared to others, as it mainly consists of killing adds while healing the dragon. The gunship battle was in fact so easy that groups which had no hope of completing Icecrown Citadel on normal difficulty still regularly beat the gunship battle on heroic difficulty, despite heroic difficulty being otherwise tuned so that the first bosses on heroic are harder than the last boss on normal.
</li><li> In Cataclysm, Blackwing Descent begins with the relatively easy Magmaw and the fairly difficult Omnitron Defense System. Then the next boss is Maloriak, who has relatively simple mechanics, and the only difficult part is managing the release of the aberrations so they're all dead before the second phase.
</li><li> In the new version of Shadowfang Keep, Baron Silverlaine comes after Baron Ashbury (who is quite difficult for groups who can't interrupt properly), and his only abilities are a healing reduction debuff and summoning adds to be defeated.
</li><li> Murozond in End Time. He has a very large amount of HP, but the ability to rewind time (which resets cooldowns and even revives dead players) five times makes killing him easy, especially since you can use Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp five times. He also has few abilities, only a breath attack and AOEs that leave behind "fire" on random players.
</li><li> In Throne of Thunder, Primordius is this after the fairly difficult Durumu and the complex but manageable Dark Animus. Primordius only has a few abilities, and most of the encounter involves killing slimes to prevent him from "evolving" and gaining a damage buff and a new ability, while then turning your attention to him once you have enough buffs and are mutated. All in all, it's a relatively simple fight. In the last wing, Iron Qon and the Twin Consorts are fairly straightforward lead-ups to the fiendishly complicated Lei Shen fight.
</li><li> In Siege of Orgrimmar, Galakras and the Dark Shaman present two tough fights that require a lot of coordination, luck and manic running around. In between is the Iron Juggernaut, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">giant robot scorpion siege engine</a> that can be easily defeated within the time limit and is unlikely to kill anyone as long as the tanks are doing their jobs properly.

The strategy to defeat it is exactly the same (by throwing mushroom blocks at it), and once again it goes down after three hits. The preceding boss (Clawgrip) is harder due to its rock throwing attack (and it has to be hit five times), and the following one is the difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> (Wart). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiPanic">Doki Doki Panic</a></em>, the boss of World 5 is a souped-up rematch against Mouser, which still makes Tryclyde an example. In the <em>Super Mario Advance</em> remake, due to boss rearrangement, World 6 is guarded by Mouser instead (specifically the World 3 rematch from the original game, and there the boss is now the equally easy Robirdo); by this late point the second Mouser battle feels almost like a letdown.
</li><li> Iggy Koopa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> comes after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> Wendy, but uses the same tactics as Larry and Morton, the first two bosses, so he's much easier.

</li><li> The Broodals aren't difficult boss fights at all, especially not in their first battles early in the adventure.

Cloud 'N' Candy is rather large and hops around the level. Every time you lick it, anywhere at all, it shrinks and speeds up a bit, until it's gone. It's pretty easy to avoid, but don't worry if it gets a couple of hits in, because <em>every lick heals Yoshi</em>.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While Antasma is fairly tough, being the penultimate boss, he's still rather easy compared to Giant Bowser immediately before and Dreamy Bowser immediately after, both of which are contenders for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.

Not Popple and someone else, just Popple on his own. And unlike in the other battles in which he comes with at least one strong team mate and can use combo attacks, in this fight he has to take on the two Mario Bros with all their items, special attacks and powers by himself. With fairly low health overall. He very quickly loses.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend Of Zelda I</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first encounter with Gohma (in the sixth dungeon) is laughably easy, as one arrow is all it takes to kill it.
</li><li> The Aquamentus guarding the seventh dungeon. For one, it already appeared in the first dungeon and remains unchanged in the rematch, so it becomes even easier if you have the Magic Shield and Magic Sword. Its fireballs can't go through the shield, so you can just stand there and hit it TWICE with the sword to kill it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em>:
<ul><li> Barba/Volvagia's attacks are predictable and easy to avoid, with the bigger danger in the battle being the lava pits.
</li><li> The only way to harm Carock in is to reflect his spells back at him, but once you've cast the proper spell, all there is to do is crouch at the left side of the screen and wait till he dies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>:

The first part of the battle he moves very slowly and is <em>very</em> vulnerable to the hookshot, and the second part of the battle has him predictably race around the room where all you have to do is stand in his way and swing your sword when he draws near.
</li><li> Blind. Any attack that damages him will deal the same amount of damage, including sword beams, and it takes a total of nine hits to kill him. If you have an upgraded shield (which is no problem, it's quite reachable if you know where to get it) to block his fireballs, you can fire sword beams at him from a safe distance and cheese the fight without difficulty.

<ul><li> The Angler Fish is not only the easiest boss in the game, but might be the easiest <em>Zelda</em> boss of all time. All you have to do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">Attack Its Weak Point</a> (which is very obviously the lights on its head) a few times and it's dead. It just sits there for a long time leaving itself open and vulnerable. If you let it live long enough to see what its attacks do, when it finally does attack, it's just very easy to avoid falling rocks and a slow-motion ramming of the wall. The only thing that might prove a minor challenge is avoiding both the Angler Fish and falling rocks if you end up in a situation where that's possible. Even so, it deals one half heart of damage and you can go over and kill it whenever you get bored.
</li><li> Hot Head is also incredibly easy, especially for being the boss of the eighth dungeon. He can be easily stunlocked by the Fire Rod, and you can rapid fire it to deal repeated damage to him, while staying at the bottom of the room, fairly safe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>: When fighting Morpha, many players realized that he can't reach the corners of the room and basically hookshot-and-slash it to death without getting a single bit of damage. You know you have a breather boss when only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">getting to it is the real challenge.</a> Some believe this was done on purpose, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> Dark Link was very difficult in comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fyrus is a total pushover, despite being a terrifying Balrog-like monster with huge chains attached to his limbs.
</li><li> Armogohma is even <em>easier</em> than Fyrus, and is a fairly late boss to boot. It's slow, a huge target, deals little damage, and is <em>extremely</em> vulnerable to the Dominion Rod item. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Darknut</a> you face halfway through the dungeon is actually much more of a challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Moldarach in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>. Being the boss of Lanayru Mining Facility, a very long and complex dungeon, it turns out to just be a random giant scorpion, and a total pushover at that. It's not even a unique specimen, since another one is battled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">mini-boss</a> later in the game.
</li><li> Margomill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em>. It does no damage directly, and just tries to knock Link into a pit. The problem is, falling damage here is ridiculously low, and doesn't increase in Hero Mode. Hence it goes down in maybe a minute tops and is likely to only take off about one heart's worth of your health at most.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>
<ul><li> Master Kohga is quite easy, but most welcome it after the tricky stealth segment that came before. Unlike most bosses in the game where you can use almost any strategy (or trying to figure out what works), Kohga follows the traditional <em>Zelda</em> boss fight where he uses attacks in a set pattern and you have to use a specific ability to interrupt him to create an opening. He mostly attacks you with huge spiked balls that he can move around in a way that you can with your Magnesis ability.
</li><li> Windblight Ganon is not very difficult. Unlike the other Blights, Windblight Ganon's second phase does not involve changing the arena or needing to make it vulnerable before attacking it. It simply uses more, stronger attacks and reduces the effectiveness of Shield Bashes. And if you have the Master Sword with you...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Zubbas in the first game can be defeated easily with either a continuous use of the Rat-a-tat Rap, or the Gold Feathers. In comparison, the boss before them (Boss Boom Box) and the one after (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, Gruntilda) are more challenging.
</li><li> Old King Coal and Mingy Jongo in <em>Banjo-Tooie</em>. The former's only attack is raising the temperature of the battlefield, and while he does it at a permanent basis after 150 seconds, the battle can be finished long before half that time passes. As for the latter, despite being the boss of the second-to-last level, he doesn't have much health, he's easy to hit, easy to dodge, and poses relatively little threat.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Bayonetta</em> series:
<ul><li> Iustitia in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em>. Whereas the other Auditio get a lot of buildup in the chapters leading up to their fights, Iustitia is barely seen and so the player likely isn't going into the fight with any expectations. The fight itself has the most repetition of all of the Auditio, where one giant face-tentacle has to be attack until Bayonetta runs along it and slices it off. She runs to the next face and does it again. After this, Iustitia enters its climactic final phase... which is just the same as the rest of the fight. It's the only Auditio to do this, too, as the other three all feature dramatic changes once they enter their last phase. To top it all off, this is coming after the two Paradiso levels "A Remembrance of Time" and "A Sea of Stars", either of which may be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>.
</li><li> Valor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2">Bayonetta 2</a></em>. For a giant, high-ranking angel that single-handedly destroys the bridge you've spent the entire last chapter building and was preceded by Glamor, he goes down easily. His attacks are blatantly telegraphed and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossOnlyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossOnlyLevel">Boss-Only Level</a> is the shortest chapter in either of the two games.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ohdarko of 004-C in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101">The Wonderful 101</a></em>. With easy to dodge attacks, it's more likely you'll die of old age because of how long the fight takes before you'll ever lose all your health.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em>: Destroyman is very easy, especially if you purchased (and powered up) Tsubaki Mk.

Despite this, he's got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>, having shocked the living Hell out of Travis several times before the battle actually starts.

She's preceded by the difficult Matt Helms and followed by the annoying Dr. Letz Shake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> has the Egg Dragoon.

</li><li> The "Egg Genesis" boss during Sonic's storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>.

<ul><li> Whip's Memory goes down quick with the help of fully mastered Shurikens. Or how about Cream Pies, which uses only 3 MP per throw and is darkness-based, something that the Memory's vulnerable to? Yes, that's right, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can defeat Richter Belmont by throwing pies at him.</span>
</li><li> Astarte is a bit of a subversion. She's often cited as beatable in less then a minute using the recently-acquired 1,000 Blades skill. However, this is not because she's easy, but because 1,000 Blades is a horrendous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, and she's in the worst position of any boss to handle it. Without 1,000 Blades, she's much more respectable. In fact, in Richter mode she's almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> since her Temptation attack might as well be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.
</li><li> Medusa can be this as well, as mastered Axes have just the right trajectory against her, like they do half of the game's bestiary.
</li></ul></li><li> Dracula Wraith's first form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Karasuman/Malphas. As <em>Dawn of Sorrow</em> showed, he would have been more challenging if he didn't "flinch" with each attack. Even in a game full of relatively easy boss fights, he stands out as <em>way</em> easier than he should have been.
</li><li> Galamoth, yes, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">that</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Galamoth</a>, becomes one of these if you swing by the castle entrance and grab the Beryl Circlet which absorbs lighting to restore HP first.

Even if one of his few non-lighting attacks touches you you'll immediately recover fully from his next lighting attack, turning an absolute nightmare into a prolonged game of jumping and mashing square. According to an interview with Koji Igarashi this was wholly intentional, as he intended for Galamoth to be so overwhelmingly difficult that you'd search the castle for an easier means to defeat him rather than enduring his harsh and overwhelming powers, possibly making him one of the few examples of a boss that's both a breather <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">a nightmare</a> at the same time.

His only "attack" is to slowly (very slowly) raise the water level. Oh, he'll teleport to the other side of the screen when you hit him, or if you take too long to do so when you get close, but once you get the pattern going, he's pitifully easy, and otherwise incapable of harming you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Stage 2 boss of <em>4</em> takes craploads of damage from the laser, which penetrates enemies and hurts them so long as it's touching them; the boss's big head certainly helps to compound the damage. In fact, when you fight his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">second form</a>, if you continuously fire lasers at him, he'll go down before any of his shots have a chance to hit you.
</li><li> In Contra 3, the first boss of the last level is quite simple if you have the Spread Gun, as it's possible to shoot at its mouth and destroy the small aliens before they even come out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Knowing a boss's weakness in any game gives you a tremendous advantage, but none more than the fight with Crash Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em>. Equip the Air Shooter, jump and fire at the right time and he goes down with one hit, before he can even get a shot off, in less than two seconds.
</li><li> Bubble Man from 2 is consider so easy by the fandom he has not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAdventuresOfDuaneAndBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAdventuresOfDuaneAndBrando">one</a> fan-song referencing this fact but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMegas">two</a>.
</li><li> Even without his weakness, Heat Man from <em>2</em> is incredibly easy. It's possible to time your shots so he never throws more than a single volley of fire, and even if you don't, all but the very first volley are a cinch to dodge. Heat Man himself follows a simple pattern, and he takes double damage from the Mega Buster compared to most <em>Mega Man</em> bosses. However, many people save him for late in the game, simply because he comes at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>.
</li><li> Metal Man's pattern is even easier than Heat Man's, even for a first time player. When you meet him again in Wily's Castle armed with his weakness he becomes a <em>complete</em> joke. The <em>only</em> reason you can't use this weakness in the first encounter? His greatest weakness is his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">own weapon</a></em>.
</li><li> Another weakling-Robot Master is Toad Man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em>. All you have to do is shoot Toad Man, while dodging his jumps, and he'll NEVER use his Rain Flush attack. One could say that the dissection (no pun intended) of this boss is too easy.
</li><li> Chill Penguin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">Mega Man X1</a></em> is generally considered the easiest boss in the game to beat without his weakness, which is good, because the weapon he gives you makes another boss a complete joke. That boss is Spark Mandrill, who, when equipped with Shotgun Ice and with proper timing, can be effectively stun-locked to death.
</li><li> The Wily Star from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManV">Mega Man V</a></em> is a long, tough level, with multiple branching paths and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">rematches</a> against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Mega Man Killers</a>, some of the toughest bosses in the Game Boy series... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and Quint.</a> He was already a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManII">his debut game</a>, and he's even more embarrassingly weak now that you have the Mega Arm.

</li><li> Because you don't necessarily need to take the bosses in order as you find them, Sakit can range from vicious to pathetic. He's a massive boss, deals out a lot of damage, and is immune to all subweapons, but he's slow and has a simple pattern. If you have the Knife, he's not bad at all.

But between Triti and Deftera, the player faces Kyriaki - the first, and most common, GUILT type. The player's faced it over a half dozen times at this point, only a few times with differences.

You see, they summon angels to assist them, and you can bring a demon with Stone Gaze to effectively knock both of the bosses adds out of commission without killing them, which would cause him to resummon them.

The thing that makes that such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">absurdly effective tactic</a> is that the petrified Angels will <em>eat the boss's turns</em>.

Reisen herself, however, is the epitome of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>. Her spells may throw you off the first time you see them, but after you spend some time in Spell Practice and learn the best way to move while the bullets are out-of-phase, her battle becomes <em>much</em> easier (particularly her last card), and makes her one of, if not the easiest stage five boss in the series. Which is good, because after her is a tough battle against Eirin or Kaguya.

He's slow and most of his attacks are short range, making him fodder for your crew's sharpshooter. His only threatening move is his super, but even that can be avoided without much trouble thanks to the large size of the arena.
<ul><li> Wapol is even less threatening in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnePieceUnlimitedWorldRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnePieceUnlimitedWorldRed">One Piece Unlimited World Red</a></em> where his only real threatening move is charging at you while biting which can be easily avoided using the handy reaction command which will come up.

The game acknowledges this and will replace him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Blackbeard</a> once he is low on health.
</li></ul></li><li> Episode 2 has Oz on Island 3, who comes after a couple of nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Dual Boss</a> battles. He's incredibly slow and majorly telegraphs his moves. If he does hit, though, kiss your current character goodbye (especially in Hard mode). Although, by this stage of the game, you shouldn't have any trouble dodging his swings. He seems even easier when compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the next two bosses.</a>

This isn't to say he's a pushover, but his position in the WVBA ranks is cushioned right between two of the hardest opponents in the game, with Bald Bull before him and Mr. Sandman after him (this is further noticeable in Title Defense, considering the infamous respective gimmicks used by Bald Bull and Mr. Sandman there).
</li><li> Nearly every boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThunderForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThunderForce">Thunder Force</a> III</em> goes down in under 30 seconds, especially if you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Sever</a>. And thanks to the extensive amount of extra lives that the game gives you, you can BS the last two bosses with as many as 9 lives left, even if your weapons are reduced to the default Twin and Back shots. Meanwhile, Iron Maiden in <em>V</em> goes down even faster if you use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Free Range</a> Over Weapon.

However, he has easy to avoid attacks, never moves, and can be attacked anywhere. The large amount of health does NOT balance it all out.

</li><li> Also, while still quite competent, <em>Andross</em> is a piece of cake compared to the improved version of the Star Wolf team you have to beat to get to him, and probably no harder than the Gorgon at the end of Area 6. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fake!Andross is tougher than Brain!Andross. Both battles are the same until you blow up the face. After that, the former is a giant robot head that, while it is vulnerable all over, has an attack that <em>cannot be dodged</em>. The latter must first have its eyes, tethered by lightning and capable of laser fire, blown off before you attack a noticeable weak point. The eyes are the toughest part, as the main brain has <em>no distance attacks</em>. In a shooting game. In All-Range mode. Its best attempt at a distance attack is the particles that are released when you hit its weak spot, but these, like the brain itself, are slow and easily avoided.</span>

</li><li> Salazar was this in the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">GameCube</a> release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>. In that version, Salazar "head" would never attack the corners of the platform where the tentacles came out, so if you got a tentacle to retreat (easily done by simply shooting it a couple times from a distance) you could go into that corner and wail on him unperturbed (until the tentacle came back out, but then you just had to shoot it again). This was fixed in the PS2 and Wii versions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has an example of this when you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalToThePast">go back in time</a> to ensure the fall of the 5th Column on a weak pretence. The task involves turning several key Column higher-ups over to the Council side, but the pacing of them is terrible. The first one is Nosferatu, one of the toughest enemies in the game. He is followed by Burkholder, who is not only one of the weakest bosses of his rank, but whom you also fight with the help of Nosferatu now on your side. You can basically walk away from the keyboard and Nosferatu will still destroy Burkholder on his own.
</li><li> The final bosses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom">Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</a></em>, for the most part. Gades is reasonably challenging - though he can only hit one character at a time, he does fairly good damage. However, Amon, Daos, and Guard Daos all suffer from a significant flaw - all their attacks are magic. While it's not weak magic, there is a spell that Jerin learns called Mirror that causes spells cast on an affected hero to be reflected back at the caster. By casting it and maintaining it for all the heroes, those bosses can't harm you and do extra damage to themselves, allowing all your remaining characters to wail away at them until they die.
</li><li> Most of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> are freaking hard such as the Nightmare and SA-X. Ironically, Ridley himself (as Ridley X) is really easy as you have two easy means to steamroll him by now. The first is you'll have the plasma beam by then which means a charged shot will reverberate right through him and do insane damage, and the second is the simple act of letting him grab you and pounding as many missiles as you can into him before he lets go. Of course, you'll get hit a lot both times, but he'll go down <em>long</em> before you do. Lovely after Nightmare and Yakuza, and before SA-X.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gravios can be this - especially if you are a gunner. Gravios has large hitboxes, has a predictable attack pattern, and is slow. While blademasters may have weapons that bounce off all the time, gunners can use pierce shots and Gravios is a <em>very</em> easy monster to kite since it gives far more warning than most enemies do.
</li><li> In <em>3 Ultimate</em>, Volvidon comes off as a mercifully easier than its predecessor, Duramboros (it also helps that its fighting style isn't too different from Arzuros and Lagombi; the only major difference is that he jumps like a rubber ball instead of doing brief charges or sliding). But it is also followed by the fast, aggressive Nibelsnarf.
</li><li> Ukanlos in <em>4 Ultimate</em>. The preceding boss, Dalamadur, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundBoss">Background Boss</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickLevel">Gimmick Level</a> rolled into one, plus a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> that is <em>very</em> difficult to defeat for solo players. Ukanlos's gimmick feels far more familiar and intuitive, especially to a newer player, and combined with such large hitboxes (Gunners delight!) and it easily feels like a Breather Boss whose only hard trait is the burrowing chase attack. The following bosses? <em>G Rank</em> monsters.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has the floor bosses in Tarturus, and most of them will wipe the floor with your face. Some however are easy enough to keep pinned to the ground with their elemental weakness. As an example, there are the three Golden Beetles on floor 47. Although they're weak to lightning attacks, they take very little damage from them...except that since they're weak, hitting them with one knocks them over. Hit all three with Zio, do an all-out attack, and you've knocked off something like 80 percent of their health.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Hermit</span> can be beaten without any worry whatsoever, even if you have 2 party members with weaknesses to its elemental attacks.

There are a total of 4 in the game, and the first 3 get progressively more difficult (with the 3rd one being controller-breaking hard). Then there is the 4th one, which is called "the ultimate combat arena challenge". What it contains is... a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">jellyfish</a>, the easiest enemy in the game. While it's still possible to lose by falling into the bottomless pits or having the jellyfish sting you multiple times, it's nowhere near as difficult as the ones before it.

However, towards the end a good deal of the ones that weren't Space fleas from nowhere were considerably weaker; the boss of the black spider clan was actually a palette swap of an earlier demon, without any new tricks. after the sea of trees and the island before hand, it was much easier. Similarly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> vigoor</span> at the end of Chapter nine was way easier than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ishtaros</span> from eight, and the final boss itself could be taken out quite easily once you got your timing in for it's attacks. Of course, in that last case, getting hit by the attacks <em>really</em> hurt, and if you rushed in to deal the finishing blow too quickly, you run into an utterly sadistic one hit kill, but once you know the pattern, it's a minimal effort boss.

You can make her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">very, very sad</a> and she will give up her soul without a fight, at least from her.

That is the <em>entire level</em> if you go that route, because her stage is one big arena to fight in and the guard is on a side path free of any other soul, then talk to her and she will put a knife into herself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Easiest boss in the game.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Moonlight Butterfly. It spends most of the time flying about, telegraphing its relatively easy to dodge attacks, and for a melee character, resting its head on the walkway for a while before engaging in another highly telegraphed charged explosion. Summoning the Witch Beatrice for the battle makes it even more of a cakewalk. The Butterfly is made even easier by the fact that it's much less psychologically daunting than most of the other bosses. Even its arena(a partly grown-over walkway) and theme are rather peaceful. Unlike the typical twelve-foot-tall horrifying undead abomination charging towards you and delivering a furious melee beatdown in a dark and enclosed room while ominous choral music roars, the Moonlight Butterfly is a pretty jade-colored spirit creature found on an old bridge over a wide-open forest. It attacks slowly and predictably with shiny, low-damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a>, while drifting peacefully overhead to a quiet piano melody. As such, it's much easier to concentrate and remain calm while fighting it.
</li><li> Pinwheel also qualifies as this. His fight takes place inbetween The Catacombs (which is filled with resurrecting skeletons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">skeleton wheels</a>), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">The Tomb of the Giants</a>, and the fight itself is a complete joke. He has only a handful of highly choreographed attacks, his health is just barely higher than the <em>second boss in the game</em>, and he's cripplingly weak to melee characters. His magic attacks actually do a fairly high amount of damage if they connect, but most players end up killing him before he can even fire one.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily">Gaping Dragon</a> isn't a particularly tough fight either. It's enormous, can instakill you by slamming its maw onto the floor, landing on you, or running over you, and has an AOE vomit attack that destroys your equipment, but it's very slow and leaves its back end wide open. If you take off the tail (not hard to do), then the fight devolves into constantly attacking his back end while he's recovering from the slam attack.
</li><li> The Demon of Song in the sequel comes at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">controller-smashingly frustrating</a> Shrine of Amana, while the area beyond it contains the memorably challenging fight with Velstadt. The Demon of Song itself has very simple, telegraphed attack patterns, and the only trick to the fight is knowing when you can damage it, which isn't too hard to figure out.
</li><li> For Faith build players in the third game, Aldrich is a cakewalk. Why? Vow of Silence. It's a Faith spell that prevents any and all magic attacks from activating for about twenty seconds when cast. Almost every single one of Aldrich's attacks are magic-based, meaning this spell completely shuts him down except for one or two relatively weaker physical attacks.
</li><li> Yhorm the Giant, once the player figures out his gimmick. You have to use the Weapon Art of the Stormruler sword found in his arena, which can kill him in five hits. He's even easier if you've completed Siegward's questline, as Siegward will join the battle wielding his own Stormruler. Trying to fight Yhorm <em>without</em> the Stormruler, while doable, turns him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> that will take forever to take down, as Yhorm has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">highest amount of health in the game</a> (yes, far more so than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, and even far more so than any of the DLC bosses).

He's slow, his attacks are telegraphed, his health is fairly pathetic for this late in the game, and he can be staggered and knocked down fairly easily. The only reason the fight takes longer than a minute is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">he's accompanied by dozens of smaller versions of himself</a>, but even then, they pose little threat.

Her first encounter is actually quite challenging, as the only thing you can use to fight her is the PSG-1 sniper rifle. During her second encounter, Col. Cambell says that you're supposed to fight her with the sniper rifle, but the player will usually have a full supply of Nikita missiles at this point. Just hide behind the ledge and fire them off, slowly guiding them right up to her. You'll kill her off without her ever firing a single shot back, or wising up about your tactics.

All you have to do is bring Winged Pikmin and nothing but Winged Pikmin, avoid the attacks and swarm it four times and you win.

She has a very small health bar, tends to appear and run straight at you making no attempt whatsoever to dodge (and no auto-aim tends to become a blessing in disguise as you can manually aim where she is running to), and has one attack that leaves her wide open for a solid 10 seconds or so. Somewhat justified in that you face Scissorman immediately after who has <em>much</em> more health and is a lot harder to bring down.
</li><li> Wing-Chun Dummy, one of the World Bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kritika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kritika">Kritika</a></em> can't attack the player and doesn't have any defenses. It's basically just an easy way to earn gold in 90 seconds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies2ItsAboutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies2ItsAboutTime">Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time</a></em> has a few (Zombot Plank Walker, Zombot Tuskmaster 10,000 BC, Zombot Aerostatic Gondola), but the biggest example is Zombot Tomorrow-tron. You're given really powerful plants (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Citron</a>, Laser Bean and Infi-nut), and you're also provided with Power tiles that can provide even further power to your plants. Any attempt to send <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> results in a plant food boost on a Citron to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> it effortlessly, as well as two more if used on a power tile. Even without plant food, Citrons can terminate the machines pretty easily. You can also plant food boost an Infi-nut to bring in a barrier that can stop even the strongest zombies, and even Zomboss's ramming attack. To add insult to injury, the single update that affected it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a></em> it <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0px8o');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0px8o" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0px8o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It used to be able to shoot 3 plants at a time, but after the nerf, only shoots one.</span>, making it an even bigger joke than before.

<ul><li> Gigapede. While he can hit hard, he doesn't hit hard as other bosses, limited area of attack, predictable pattern and a large target. Be quick enough you can avoid all of his attacks and with enough skill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">deflect some of his attacks back on him</a> and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessVictory">Flawless Victory</a>. That is, if you are someone who can pull through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">the extremely difficult game</a>
</li><li> Two more Gigapedes are encountered inside the Leviathan who give more challenge but still pretty easy compared to other bosses
</li><li> Lady. While she provides more challenge than Gigapede, be careful and you can waltz through her as well
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a></em> series
<ul><li> The first game has the Wheel Beast. To wit, the boss battles in the first game follows a patter where you use the animal transformation you gained in the dungeon in some way to beat the boss. In the case of the Wheel Beast, the wall-crawling ability of the Spider transformation not only allows you to hit the switches that damage the boss a lot, but it also lets you completely avoid all of his attacks with impunity.
</li><li> <em>Shantae and the Pirate's Curse</em> has the Steel Maggot. It has two easily avoided attacks: One where it slowly crawls back and forth across the screen, and another where it fires a fan of widely-spaced projectiles if you hit the wrong buttons on its back. You do have to guess what sequence of buttons to hit on its back to damage it, but this is easier than it sounds since there are only three buttons you need to hit. There's a reason why it's one of the easier bosses to defeat without taking damage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ocu4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5ocu4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ocu4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">according to the Steam Global Achievement Stats</span> despite its placement in the penultimate dungeon.
</li></ul></li><li> In Chapter 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnTales">Rakenzarn Tales</a></em>, the next boss after Naneal and the Shadow Wind is a muck creature called the Pellaidh. It's statistically weaker than the previous two bosses and has a weakness to fire, one of the most common elemental attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SaltAndSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SaltAndSanctuary">Salt and Sanctuary</a></em>:
<ul><li> The easiest boss in the game is widely considered to be That Stench Most Foul, thanks to its low poison damage, propensity to just summon extremely weak minions, huge hitbox and <em>ridiculous</em> weakness to both Holy and Fire damage, which means it goes down extremely quickly to both applied Pitchfire/Blessed Pages and fire magic spam without a chance to retaliate with anything more than harmless knockback or underwhelming poison. Players are usually thankful, as the preceding boss is always the Disemboweled Husk, which is a giant pain in the ass.
</li><li> The Untouched Inquisitor doesn't have the glaring elemental weaknesses of the above, nor the giant hitbox that makes melee characters shred through, so he's not quite as much of a pushover. But his damage is fairly low, his attacks are samey and predictable, all a variation of throwing his blades at the floor, and his HP is nothing to write home about, so he doesn't pose too big of a threat. This serves to catch your breath right before the very next boss just a little further up, the Third Lamb, which is the complete opposite: Unpredictable as all hell, tanky and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">terribly dangerous</a>.
</li><li> Carsejaw the Cruel is an enormous pushover, thanks to being a slow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> who can't even put out that much damage to begin with. If you're powerful enough to reach him, and have something with a little fire or holy damage, you will shred him in <em>seconds</em>, and even with weak damage you're bound to destroy him in less than a minute. Rather pathetic for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, but when the entire rest of the level is ripped straight from the Third Circle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a>, it's quite welcome. Even more so when you consider the next story-relevant boss is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Witch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">Lake</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead">Cuphead</a></em>, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a> in Inkwell Isle II and bosses like Rumor Honeybottoms and Captain Brineybeard in Isle III, you battle Sally Stageplay. Unlike those other bosses that require difficult platforming sections (Honeybottoms or Grim Matchstick) or attacks which can easily trap you (Brineybeard or Wally Warbles), Sally gives you a wide open arena with no blind spots and telegraphed attacks that are fairly easy to dodge. Granted she <em>can</em> deliver a pretty solid beatdown (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">nothing in this game is exactly "easy"</a>) but she'd be right at home among the Isle I bosses. Likely intentional, as she seems more focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShowMustGoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShowMustGoOn">putting on a show</a> than actually putting up a real fight.
<ul><li> Werner Werman is also this, combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestBossEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestBossEver">Best Boss Ever</a>. Similarly to Sally, he's a Isle III boss that'd fit in great with the Isle I bosses, and doesn't require much other than decent enough jumping/dashing skills, which at that point in the game the player would have already likely mastered. The arena you fight him in is simple, small, and has no stage hazards at all, and even if the ending phase with the cat is easily the hardest part, it pales in comparison to middling-difficulty bosses like Cagney Carnation. He seems to be in the game more for comedic value (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as well as the ridiculous plot twist at the end</span>) than an actual challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Krawlie/Sir Krawlie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>. He's the boss at the end of the Abandoned Sewers dungeon, but due to his low difficulty many players actually had no idea he's supposed to be a boss. If you fight Krawlie when you first enter the 2300 AD time period, he at least stands a ghost of a chance against you with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> attack. However, if you decide to enter this dungeon much later in the game, he pretty much becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a>.
</li><li> Mappi, the first boss of the second disk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">While he does have two thieves alongside him</a>, he only uses a weak physical attack and his two flunkies can be easily dispatched.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6pz1z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6pz1z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6pz1z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">According to the game's wiki, he can potentially use a move that's an insant-kill, but only does it if at least one of his two thieves is still alive. And since a player's first instinct will be to eliminate his flunkies, one could never even find out that he can use this move.</span> He even has less HP than the preceding bosses. The fact that he comes right after Doel, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, makes it even more egregious.
</li><li> Due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">glaring oversight on the dev's part</a>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a>: Dual Strike</em> battle "Two-Week Test" becomes laughably easy if you just do nothing. The goal is to survive for 14 turns, but if you do nothing the enemy can't win by routing your forces since you have no forces to destroy (you start with none and have to deploy them yourself via factories), and the enemy won't be able to capture your HQ since their infantry will be blocked by their own faster vehicle units which will swarm all over your properties.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodzillaMonsterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodzillaMonsterOfMonsters">Godzilla: Monster of Monsters</a>:</em>
<ul><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> side of the fence is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMysterians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMysterians">Moguera</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsHedorah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsHedorah">Hedorah</a>, who both have the trait of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">can be helplessly stun-locked in the corner</a>". With Moguera it's by crouching and tail-whipping, and with Hedorah it's by punching as swiftly as possible. Neither character will be able to retaliate at all, making for easy level-up fodder and a good breather to restore health in later levels when you're being swarmed by multiple enemies at once.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> side of the fence is the parked Planet X Battleship, a very rarely-encountered foe that appears as early as Neptune but is most likely to be first encountered on the Swamp Terrain stage of Planet X. <em>You can just walk past it</em> since the thing has no hit detection and can't block you like any other boss in the game. The polite thing to do is to wave to them as you pass.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>: Golem is fought after the difficult Mechanical Bosses and Plantera, summoned at the end of the Jungle Temple (which you have to treck through the brutal Underground Jungle just to reach), and is right before a lengthy endgame event that begins with the Lunatic Cultist fight. Compared to the other Hardmode bosses, Golem's attacks are easy to avoid and the fight is extremely easy to cheese by virtue of it being one of the two bosses in the entire game unable to pass through blocks. It says quite a bit about Golem in that the other boss unable to pass through solid blocks is King Slime, intended to be the weakest boss in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhTheDuelistsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhTheDuelistsOfTheRoses">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses</a></em> has Tristan, only spared from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss">Warm-Up Boss</a> by being the second fightable opponent on the White Rose campaign when the first one (Tea) is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>. His absolute strongest monster has only 2000 ATK, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">he has no archetypal focus</a> and is fought on varied terrain (meaning he doesn't get the field boosts of most enemies), and his only Spells are two cards with random or situational effects and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> Ritual he will never be able to activate. On top of that, since many of his cards have inflated but still-poor stats, his Deck Cost is among the highest in the game, meaning you'll be able to bring your best cards to fight him. Players who started with the Red Rose campaign and therefore have all the cards and experience won through that route will find him to be even more pathetic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Team Racing</a></em> has Papu Papu, the second and easiest boss in the game. Unlike Ripper Roo before him, who uses TNT crates on a track with no shortcuts, Papu Papu wields the considerably less dangerous beakers on a track that has two downright <em>devastating</em> shortcuts that he will never attempt to use. And while other bosses tend to be all over their tracks making it tricky to hit them with crates or beakers, Papu Papu drives straight up the middle of his track which conveniently has a line going down it. Drop anything on that line anywhere the track is remotely straight and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">he will hit it every single time without fail</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfGrimrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfGrimrock">Legend of Grimrock</a> 2</em> has the Wormbound brothers. The game world is non-linear as soon as you leave Shipwreck Beach, but Wormbound Catacombs is expected to be one of the last areas, since getting to it requires solving a puzzle with the clue on the opposite side of the map. And yet both brothers are much easier than bosses like Herder's Den and the Ratling Boss that you probably encountered much earlier. The ghoul pit and the Trickster encounter are the real dangers in Wormbound Catacombs.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of the Science Fiction chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive">Live A Live</a></em> is so incredibly easy that he would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a> if not for the fact that it's theoretically possible to lose to him if you don't figure out the <em>very</em> obvious tactic to beating him: take out the Stabilizers that heal the boss, then stand beside it and spam your heal ability while the boss fruitlessly attacks and triggers your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Counter-Attack</a> over and over until it dies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaShadowOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaShadowOfDarkness">Ninja: Shadow of Darkness</a></em>: The Sumo mercenary that shows up halfway through the game, during the beach level. The first few bosses includes a fire-breathing Cerberus, a winged T-Rex, three different dragons and all kinds of humongous abominations that towers over you, and by this point of the game you'd no doubt be surprised to face a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> Sumo wrestler. Granted, he's surprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">Acrofatic</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard">Kevlard</a> can absorb plenty of hits, but he lacks the ranged attacks most previous bosses has, attacks you unarmed and his ground-pound is quite easy to dodge. Not really a challenge for a badass ninja warrior who had slain plenty of behemoths by that point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest">Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</a></em> has Kudgel, who's nestled comfortably between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Kleever</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">King Zing</a>. Unlike the boss before him who requires tricky jumping from hook to hook, and the boss after who is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">bullshit all across the board</a>, Kudgel has a very simple and predictable attack pattern that actually gets <em>easier</em> to dodge as the fight goes on, as all he does is speed up which makes timing your dodging easier. In fact he may even be easier than Krow the first world boss: you run to the left, dodge his ground pound, run to the right, dodge his ground pound, throw a TNT barrel at him, repeat until dead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreadsOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreadsOfFate">Threads of Fate</a></em>, after facing off against several rather frustrating battles against Duke or Belle (who <em>exactly</em> you fight depends on whether you play as Mint or Rue), and then a tricky fight against both of them at once and their Hexagon Machine, you get challenged to a rematch by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Blood and Smokey</a> who sick their boss Trap Master on you. He talks a big game but he goes down in about five good hits, has a <em>very</em> predictable pattern that's easy to dodge, has no powerful attacks, and your biggest threat during the fight is <em>accidentally wandering off of a platform</em>. Rue and Mint actually call him out on how he's no real threat to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae and the Seven Sirens</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Of the major bosses, the Octo Siren of the Squid Pit is notoriously easier than all the other bosses, even the first one. She's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> than anything, where you need to either guess or use Seer Dance to determine which order to destroy her weak points and then attack when she's stunned, and not only are her attacks telegraphed and easy to avoid but you can temporarily knock them out of commission altogether with Spark Dance. In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> battle against Risky Boots is considerably more difficult than the Octo Siren.
</li><li> Of the minor bosses, the four energy collectors are complete pushovers. Their weak point is immobile, unguarded, and their only means of attacking is with lasers that are telegraphed with targets that appear on the floor and can be avoided with the Newt Dash. They're such a non-threat that they might as well not be in the game.
