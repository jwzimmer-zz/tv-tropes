<p>The movie is finished. The cast and crew have been paid, post-production is done. All it needs is an advertising campaign and to be sent to the theaters. Except it isn't, at least not at the speed most of its completed brethren do.
</p><p>The act of being "shelved" is one of the oddities of the movie business. There are many reasons that a completed movie is set aside: a matter of timing, dissatisfaction with the result, corporate restructuring, unexpected copyright problems, etc. It can last anywhere from a couple months to forever.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em> was originally dubbed and prepared for a home video release in the US in 1998, and trailers for it appeared on various Disney VHS tapes. However, because of the surprise success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em> on video, Disney decided to rethink their plan for the film. They planned on releasing it in theaters first, and they re-recorded the film's musical score with the original composer. However, after the disappointment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em>'s theatrical release, Disney once again decided to rethink how to release <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, and put it on hold again. The film sat on the shelf until 2003 when it was finally released by Disney on video and DVD after only being screened at a few children's festivals.
</li><li> The North American license for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">InuYasha: The Final Act</a></em> was originally announced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> in mid-2009, around the time the anime began airing in Japan. The English dub was completed by the end of 2010, according to the actors in it. However, it didn't see a home video release until the end of 2012, over three years after its initial announcement.
</li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movie was screened in some theaters by Funimation in 2013, and was slated to be released to DVD/Blu-ray in February 2014, with pre-orders going up. However, the release was indefinitely put on hold, with widely varying explanations (from the booking of more screenings, to Studio Khara wanting more involvement), and the English voice actors discussed coming back to re-record some of their lines. There were even rumors of the film being snatched from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> and given to someone else with a completely new dub. The film came out on Blu-ray in February 2016 from FUNimation, two years after its original release date, with an entirely redone English dub and two different subtitle translations. It was later revealed that a representative from Khara had attended the dub's premiere at Otakon, and was horrified at the audience's amused reaction to the film, and blamed it on the localization. FUNimation tried explaining to them that anime convention crowds are usually very energetic, but Khara still forced them to redo the localization from scratch, resulting in a dub that was rather dry compared to what was originally screened. This may have played a part in a new dub with a new script and cast being commissioned for the original <em>Evangelion</em> franchise (which also went down a dry and literal path).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">009 RE:Cyborg</a></em> was announced by Anime Limited for a release in the UK in 2013. The release kept getting delayed, with the English dub having to be completely redone at least once at the request of Production I.G. It finally came out in 2015, and was picked up for US distribution by FUNimation that same year.
</li><li> Around 1968, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TMSEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TMSEntertainment">TMS Entertainment</a> made a 26-episode show called <em>Chingo Muchabei</em> (The Extravagant Muchabei), but it did not air until 1971, where it was burned through by airing the episodes daily during weekdays for over six weeks. The reason for the delay was because the show was filmed in black and white, and Japanese television has been heavily transitioning to color by then (even though TMS made at least two more black and white shows after this, both of which aired on schedule). Because of the delay, this show ended up being the last black and white anime to air on television.
</li><li> The Funimation dub for the Buu saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> began recording in 2013, with plans to release it in 2014 alongside the Japanese airing. Come 2014, however, and there were no signs of the dub's release. Even the dub's cast was confused, stating that they had already recorded all their lines. The dub wouldn't see a release for a few more years, eventually premiering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> at the start of 2017. Many have speculated as a result that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation">Toei Animation</a> was simply withholding the dub's release until the previous three arcs finished airing on Toonami. It's especially confusing though, since it was being put together <em>specifically for</em> overseas broadcasts (it only aired in Japan because of the unexpected cancellation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> opening a timeslot), since the first four arcs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">did better outside of Japan than in</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanSchemmel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanSchemmel">Sean Schemmel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert">Kyle Hebert</a> announced they'd started recording the dub in 2014, and seeing as how the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Battle of Gods</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection &#145;F&#146;</a></em> movies came out in the meantime, you'd assume that they'd air, or release it on home media, to tie in, but nope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland">Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</a></em> was released in Japan in 1989 but even though it was an U.S. co-production intended for Western audiences from the beginning &mdash; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleNemoTheDreamMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleNemoTheDreamMaster">the Nintendo game adaptation</a> made it to the United States on time &mdash; it would not be released in that country until 1992 as one of several foreign and/or shelved animated features that were rushed to that market to capitalize on the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> the previous winter.

(The film was originally made as a silent, but it was then decided to add a soundtrack using a synchronised sound-on-disk process which proved unreliable and didn't take off, then there were financial difficulties and artistic arguments about creating a sound-on-film talkie version.)

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a></em> was completed in 1988 by Filmation, but sat unreleased as the company filed for bankruptcy in 1989. A 1990 wide release was advertised and even warranted reviews but was yanked at the last moment; it eventually saw a limited theatrical release in 1993, and was met with the lukewarm response that had been the norm for the company.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Foodfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Foodfight">Foodfight!</a></em> had a troubled production, as it started production in 2002, but sometime afterwards, the animation programming was stolen. It got shelved for several years, was completed by 2009, and saw release in 2012.

This cut of the film was finally released on December 12, 2000. The original unedited version wasn't released until April 23, 2002. This was during a heavy backlash against violence in films, TV shows, and video games following the Columbine High School massacre.

After finding a distributor, this got invoked a second time when they set the release date to early 2016 due to the releases of much larger pictures such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>.

It starred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser">Brendan Fraser</a> as the titular character and was notable for having the final performance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> before his death.

<ul><li> The dark comedy <em>Nailed</em> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaBiel">Jessica Biel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakeGyllenhaal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakeGyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>; it apparently was such a bad experience that director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidORussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidORussell">David O. Russell</a> refused to finish the film. Eventually, <em>Nailed</em> (now called <em>Accidental Love</em>) was released in 2015 without Russell's involvement (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlanSmithee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlanSmithee">or credit</a>).
</li><li> Also hit was the crime drama <em>Black Water Transit</em>, directed by Tony Kaye (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanHistoryX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanHistoryX">American History X</a></em>) and starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne">Laurence Fishburne</a>, though there was a 2009 screening at Cannes on the latter (which Kaye says he's still in the process of editing, so that one may well see the light of day eventually). The rights for <em>Black Water Transit</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://deadline.com/2014/09/david-bergstein-aramid-lawsuit-settlement-ron-tutor-828822/">have been acquired<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but as of 2016, it still hasn't gotten a general release.
</li></ul></li><li> CBS Films:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoenBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoenBrothers">The Coen Brothers</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InsideLlewynDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InsideLlewynDavis">Inside Llewyn Davis</a></em> had a hard time finding distribution after its completion due to films about the music industry being box office poison and the lack of a major lead. Finally, CBS (who ironically shelved the Coen Brothers-written <em>Gambit</em>) picked it up for a December 2013 release.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Gambit</em>, CBS Films initially planned an October 2012 release date for the film only to shelve it without explanation. It ended up bypassing a theatrical run and went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> in April 2014.
</li><li> The horror movie <em>Flight 7500</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrudge">The Grudge</a></em> director Takashi Shimizu's third English-language movie, was originally scheduled for an August 2012 release (and had trailers released in February 2012) but was pulled from the release schedule by distributor CBS Films a few months before opening. It was then pushed to April 2013, which passed with no release, and star Scout Taylor-Compton tweeted that it would come out in October of 2013. It didn't, but then was reported to be coming out on October of 2014. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeatsItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeatsItself">It didn't.</a>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lionsgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lionsgate">Lionsgate</a>, who took over distribution duties for CBS Films, finally put <em>Flight 7500</em> out of its misery by giving it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">straight-to-DVD</a> release on April 5, 2016.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DimensionFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DimensionFilms">Dimension Films</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany">The Weinstein Company</a>:
<ul><li> In general, they would arbitrarily delay some films because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting">Hollywood Accounting</a> reasons. It's unclear if they were promised bonuses for meeting goals or were trying to spread out their revenue to avoid paying out bonuses.
</li><li> <em>Texas Rangers</em> and <em>My Boss's Daughter</em> (changed from original title "The Guests") were both shelved for over a year owing to the problems at Dimension Studios. The former only got a limited release, though the latter managed to do decent business.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllTheBoysLoveMandyLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllTheBoysLoveMandyLane">All the Boys Love Mandy Lane</a></em>. The tale of this cult horror movie's long-delayed American release is a long and tragic one that's almost more famous than the movie itself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany">The Weinstein Company</a> spent three million dollars to pick the finished film up for distribution, and planned to give it a wide release in 2007... and then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grindhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grindhouse">Grindhouse</a></em> flopped despite large amounts of publicity and a warm reception from critics, along with other big studio horror films around the same time. The Weinsteins, feeling that horror was now an unsound investment, sold the film to Senator Entertainment US, who went out of business before its release, leaving the film in limbo. For years, it didn't see the light of day in America outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">bootlegs and film festival screenings</a>. Fortunately, the film <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">released in Britain</a>, where it proceeded to make back its budget two-and-a-half times over. Even more fortunately, The Weinstein Company bought back the film, settled the legal troubles and got a limited October 2013 theatrical release (following a VOD release the month before) through their Radius label. Examined in detail in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.goodbadflicks.com/exploring-all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane/">GoodBadFlicks' 183rd episode<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Amityville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Amityville">Amityville: The Awakening</a></em> was originally supposed to be released on January 2, 2015, but was delayed indefinitely a few months prior to its release. It was rescheduled for a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/379455-amityville-reawakening-viral-dated-2016/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=amityville-reawakening-viral-dated-2016">April 15, 2016<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> release, only to be bumbled up to April 1. Suddenly, the film was delayed yet again and set for a January 6, 2017 release before being shelved again a month before release. It was then set to come out on June 30, 2017, but was then put on the shelf once again. It was released in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">foreign markets</a> beginning on July 20, 2017. In the US, it was <a class="urllink" href="http://deadline.com/2017/09/amityville-the-awakening-to-stream-on-google-play-for-free-gets-limited-theatrical-release-1202174538/">dumped on Google Play<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for free viewing on October 12, with a limited theatrical release following on October 28.
</li><li> Dimension Films also delayed horror films <em>Demonic</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clown">Clown</a></em> for unknown reasons. The latter did see a limited/VOD release on June 2016 after being completed for three years, and the former was quietly dumped on Spike TV (of all places) in July 2017 with a DVD release following on October 10th.
</li><li> The medical thriller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Awake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Awake">Awake</a></em> was shot in 2005 but not released until 2007 due to numerous test screenings that required further re-editing involving subplots that were deleted, and being delayed repeatedly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany">The Weinstein Company</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fanboys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fanboys">Fanboys</a></em> went through a legendary delay &#150; it was finished in 2007, but delayed because the Weinsteins thought the cancer subplot in the film would make it less profitable, so they hired another director to re-shoot certain scenes, though Kyle Masterson eventually prevailed and managed to get the film a limited theatrical release in 2009 with the subplot intact.
</li><li> The Weinstein Company strikes again! They originally set an April 2015 release date for the animated film <em>Underdogs</em>, but they pushed it back to August 14, 2015 to take advantage of the late summer season. Then the Weinsteins delayed it indefinitely <em>a mere week</em> before it was set to open for unknown reasons. It wound up going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> on July 19, 2016.
</li><li> Horror film <em>Viral</em> was originally set for a February 19, 2016 release, but it was shelved by The Weinstein Company. It later only got a limited theatrical release on <a class="urllink" href="http://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3395858/viral-going-infect-people-home-video/">July 29<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, alongside a simultaneous VOD release. Amusingly, this meant the film was released two days <em>after</em> the wide theatrical release of the directors' next film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nerve">Nerve</a></em> (from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lionsgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lionsgate">Lionsgate</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortySevenMetersDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortySevenMetersDown">47 Meters Down</a></em>, which was originally titled <em>In the Deep</em>, was originally set for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> release in August 2016 after some delays. Only a week before the film was set to hit the shelves, Dimension Films cancelled the release and put the film in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">turnaround</a>. It got picked up by rookie company Entertainment Studios and they gave the film a wide theatrical release in June 2017. Despite mixed reviews, it turned a profit.
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TulipFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TulipFever">Tulip Fever</a></em> was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> for almost a decade until it finally went before the cameras in 2014, and it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">hoped to be a major awards contender</a>. Footage of the film was screened at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, and the film was set for a December 2015 release. However it was sent back repeatedly for re-editing, and it was delayed to July 15, 2016, and then again to February 24, 2017 before being delayed once again to August 25, 2017, but it was ultimately dumped to theaters on September 1, 2017 with little advertising and almost no fanfare. To make matters worse, that weekend ended up being the worst at the US box office since the weekend after 9/11, and the film bombed with only $2.4 million across its entire run (with a $25 million budget). It also ended up being the final film released by The Weinstein Company, since Harvey's sexual harassment scandal came to light only a month later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Polaroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Polaroid">Polaroid</a></em> was originally set to hit theaters in August 2017, but The Weinstein Company pushed it back to December 2017. It was then moved up to November 22, but the subsequent meltdown at the company following the scandal caused the film to be delayed indefinitely. There were plans to have it released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>, but negotiations fell through. Eventually, Vertical Entertainment quietly picked up the film and sent it straight to VOD on September 17, 2019 with a limited theatrical run a month later, though not before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">it was released internationally</a> (Jan 10, 2019 in Germany, and June 1, 2019 in the UK). In the intervening time, MGM arranged a special screening of the film and was impressed enough to tap its director, Lars Klevberg, to direct their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildsPlay2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildsPlay2019">Child's Play</a></em> reboot.
</li><li> The controversy over the company also affected <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCurrentWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCurrentWar">The Current War</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar Bait</a> hopeful had to abort its November 24th release date. Eventually, it got released in 2019.
</li><li> Another film affected by the scandals was <em>The War With Grandpa</em>, an adaptation of the children's book of the same name starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro">Robert de Niro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LauraMarano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LauraMarano">Laura Marano</a>. Originally set for an early 2018 release, it was pulled off the schedule at the last minute and eventually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.thewrap.com/weinstein-co-fire-sale-robert-de-niro-war-with-grandpa-sold-back-2-5-million/">sold back to its producers.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Eventually, <a class="urllink" href="https://deadline.com/2020/06/robert-de-niro-comedy-the-war-with-grandpa-theatrical-release-1202972683/">101 Studios(founded by former Weinstein Company executive David Glasser) acquired the distribution rights<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and released the movie on October 9, 2020.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUpside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUpside">The Upside</a></em> (the American remake of French film <em>The Intouchables</em>) was shot in early 2017 for a March 9, 2018 release, however the Weinstein scandal delayed the film indefinitely. It was finally released on January 11, 2019 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/STXEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/STXEntertainment">STX Entertainment</a> (edited from an R-rated film to PG-13), to mixed reviews but surprisingly good box office.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MetroGoldwynMayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MetroGoldwynMayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>:
<ul><li> The found-footage horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePoughkeepsieTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePoughkeepsieTapes">The Poughkeepsie Tapes</a></em> was originally scheduled for release in February 2008, but its release was delayed indefinitely a month before it was to come out, with no explanation given by its distributor. Given that that distributor was MGM, which was just starting to fall apart at the time, it's not difficult to guess why. The film finally saw a VOD release through DirecTV in 2014, but was pulled shortly thereafter, meaning that the film was not available through any legal channels for the longest time, being only available through bootlegs and festival screenings. Scream Factory finally released it on DVD and Blu-ray <a class="urllink" href="https://www.shoutfactory.com/product/the-poughkeepsie-tapes?product_id=6373">Oct 10, 2017.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn2012">Red Dawn</a></em> was mostly complete in 2009, but got shelved due to MGM going bankrupt. After the studio solved its financial problems &#150; and after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Re-Cut</a> to replace the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Chinese villains</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">North Koreans</a> &mdash; it saw a November 2012 release date after being sold to Film District.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinInTheWoods">The Cabin in the Woods</a></em> was also a victim of MGM's collapse. It was finished in 2009, but MGM delayed it to do a 3-D conversion, and <em>then</em> their bankruptcy forced them to abandon those plans. The film was sold to Lionsgate and finally saw the light of day in April 2012, to critical acclaim and box-office success. The delays meant the star of both <em>Red Dawn</em> and <em>Cabin</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisHemsworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisHemsworth">Chris Hemsworth</a>, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">a breakthrough role</a> during the shelving, and had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">another movie playing</a> the same year both delayed films hit theaters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zookeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zookeeper">Zookeeper</a></em> was filmed in 2009 with a July 2010 release in mind, but MGM's aforementioned financial issues meant the film was delayed to July 2011, along with Sony (who initially only co-produced the film) taking over distribution.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rollerball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rollerball">Rollerball</a></em> was originally supposed to premiere in 2001, but it got pushed back several times until it was finally released in February 2002.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supernova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supernova">Supernova</a></em> was filmed in 1998, but was shelved until January 2000 due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, with the film's director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterHill">Walter Hill</a> disowning the finished product.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a></em> finished filming in 2017 and was set for June 29, 2018, but was pulled before release due to controversies surrounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoganPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoganPaul">Logan Paul</a>, who has a supporting role in it. MGM then scheduled it for May 8, 2020... where it ended up as basically straight-to-digital, as the COVID-19 pandemic closed theaters that weren't drive-ins.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms">Miramax Films</a>:
<ul><li> Miramax had a glut of films finished in the early 2000s and delayed releasing some of them for several years. Many made nowhere near the money production had cost.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatRaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatRaid">The Great Raid</a></em> was one of these.
</li><li> <em>Underclassman</em> was another.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindingNeverland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindingNeverland">Finding Neverland</a></em> was filmed in 2002 but wasn't released until 2004, since Miramax didn't want the film to open close to/against Universal's straight adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>. In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, the delayed release ended up getting a number of Oscar nominations (including Best Picture; it won for Original Score) and did well at the box-office; it helped that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a>'s star considerably rose in the gap between filming and release thanks to the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em> movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mindhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mindhunters">Mindhunters</a></em> was filmed in 2002, but didn't come out in the United States until May 2005 (it was released around the world the previous year) due to the split between Miramax and Disney.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrionPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrionPictures">Orion Pictures</a> filed for bankruptcy in December 1991, but not before delaying release dates of some films and selling off the rights to others (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em>). The studio didn't get back into active film production until around 1995, and spent the interim releasing the already completed pre-bankruptcy product.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em> was delayed, but not to a great extent. Orion was supposed to release both it and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves">Dances with Wolves</a></em> during the 1990 Holiday season, but pushed the former to February 1991 because the studio had only enough money to put out <em>one</em> Oscar campaign that year. It ultimately paid off when <em>Wolves</em> and <em>Lambs</em> gave Orion back-to-back Best Picture Oscars.
</li><li> <em>Blue Sky</em>. Completed in 1990, not released until 1994 &mdash; by which time the film's director had been dead for three years. Even so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaLange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessicaLange">Jessica Lange</a> won an Oscar for Best Actress!

</li><li> <em>The Favor</em> was filmed in 1990 but released in 1994. The presence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>, who had yet to achieve fame when this film was shot, didn't help the film's box-office.
</li><li> Orion abruptly pulled advertising for one of its films after its September 1991 release date was cancelled. That film, a dramedy entitled <em>Married to It</em> (directed by Arthur Hiller and starring some familiar faces) went unreleased until the Spring of 1993.
</li><li> The 1994 Martin Short comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clifford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clifford">Clifford</a></em> was also filmed in 1990 and it clearly shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkHalf">The Dark Half</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> adaptation directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero">George A.

</li><li> The 1960s-set civil rights drama <em>Love Field</em> (filmed in 1990, released in 1992) garnered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichellePfeiffer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichellePfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.
</li><li> <em>There Goes My Baby</em>, a would-be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti">American Graffiti</a></em> starring Dermot Mulroney and Ricky Schroeder, had a scene recreating the Watts Riots in 1965 Los Angeles, filmed only a few years before a similar race-related riot occurred in the same city. Rather than publicizing the event, Orion waited until a very limited theatrical run in September 1994 to put it out.
</li></ul></li><li> Because of the financial issues and subsequent bankruptcy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RelativityMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RelativityMedia">Relativity Media</a>, many of their pending films have been put into release limbo, getting tangled with legal and rights issues along the way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailerDelay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailerDelay">Trailer Delay</a> played a role for the most part. Among the victims of Relativity's collapse were:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBronze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBronze">The Bronze</a></em>, a Sundance comedy Relativity bought for $3 million (after a bidding war with Sony, who managed to get the international rights) was set to open on July 10, 2015. It got postponed to October 16, 2015 over concerns of the Summer competition with other raunchy titles like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ted2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ted2">Ted 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vacation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vacation">Vacation</a></em>. Once the bankruptcy protection kicked into high gear, Relativity had no choice but to remove the film from its schedule. Sony Pictures Classics snatched up the domestic rights shortly afterwards, creating a sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>. Released on March 18, 2016, <em>The Bronze</em> turned out to have been an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">embarrassing failure</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Masterminds2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Masterminds2016">Masterminds</a></em>, a comedy starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenWiig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenWiig">Kristen Wiig</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZachGalifianakis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZachGalifianakis">Zach Galifianakis</a> was supposed to be Relativity's big summer movie with an August 19, 2015 release date. As their financial scars worsen, they pushed it to October 9, 2015 claiming that the studio needed more time to promote the film. Despite Relativity's best intentions to release the film during their potential sale, the plans got thwacked and they were forced to delay the film for the time being. Foreign distributors were miffed on the ordeal. With Relativity exiting bankruptcy, a new date of September 30, 2016 was set. Following poor numbers on opening weekend, Relativity found themselves up for sale suggesting that their financial hopes for the film were a bit too premature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kidnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kidnap">Kidnap</a></em> was set for an October 9, 2015 release date, which got changed to February 26, 2016 to make room for the aforementioned <em>Masterminds</em>, if it went forward with the release that is. While the film is not off the slate just yet, RKA Film Financing threaten to confiscate the rights to this and three other films from Relativity, only to back out later. The date eventually got pushed back to May 13, only for it to be further delayed to December 2. Eventually, the now flailing Relativity delayed it to March 10, 2017, but that date came and went without any sort of theatrical release. The company had no choice but to let it go and <em>Kidnap</em> bowed from Aviron Pictures <a class="urllink" href="http://deadline.com/2017/05/halle-berry-kidnap-david-dinerstein-aviron-pictures-launch-alec-baldwin-drunk-parents-1202089596/">on August 4th<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The film was only a moderate hit at the box office.
</li><li> <em>Hillsong: Let Hope Rise</em>, a concert film covering the Australian Christian church, was originally set to be released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> for April 1, 2015. After their partner Alcon Entertainment failed to secure the rights, the film was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">carried over</a> to Relativity and they set a September 30, 2015 date. They ended up canceling the release on the eve of their bankruptcy filings and the rights reverted back to the producers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PureFlix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PureFlix">Pure Flix</a> snatched the film up with a September 16, 2016 release and mediocre box office results.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JaneGotAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JaneGotAGun">Jane Got A Gun</a></em> was among the Relativity casualties and it did its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> no favors. Originally set for a September 4, 2015 release after its February 20 date got pushed back, the film was removed from the schedule entirely and Relativity had to give up on the rights. The Weinstein Company (who co-produced the film) handled the US release, opening it on January 29, 2016 (when it bombed, giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a> the first of two consecutive commercial bloody noses, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrideAndPrejudiceAndZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrideAndPrejudiceAndZombies">Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</a></em> [on which she was one of the producers] opened and underperformed the following week). You can say that Relativity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">dodged a bullet</a> with this one.
</li><li> The British thriller <em>Autobahn</em>, AKA <em>Collide</em>, had an October 30, 2015 release planned, but rights mishaps have screwed the film out of release. Sales agent IM Global successfully worked the issues out, with the film scheduled to open on April 1, 2016 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OpenRoadFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OpenRoadFilms">Open Road Films</a>, though that was then pushed back to August 19th. That date came without the film showing up Stateside; a <a class="urllink" href="http://deadline.com/2016/09/collide-felicity-jones-nicholas-hoult-open-road-1201828525/">new date<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of February 24, 2017 was set. <em>Collide</em> was released on that day, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">crashed and burned at the box office</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDisappointmentsRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDisappointmentsRoom">The Disappointments Room</a></em> was another victim of Relativity's financial collapse. It was supposed to come out on September 25, 2015, but the release was quietly canned. It was set for March 25, 2016, but that date had to pushed back now that Relativity has emerged from bankruptcy with a sure-fire date of November 18 announced. Later on, the film was moved up to September 9th and replaced the following title. Upon release, the film was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">nothing short of a disappointment</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">at the box office</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeforeIWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeforeIWake">Before I Wake</a></em>. This horror film was originally set for May 8, 2015, only to be pushed back to September 25, 2015. Unfortunately, it could not escape Relativity's perturbation and the release was delayed indefinitely. With the issues at the studio being resolved, a new date for April 8, 2016 has been announced only for it to be pushed back until September 9. Suddenly, the studio delayed the film <em>again</em> to an unspecified date. This cause some <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thewrap.com/ryan-kavanaugh-before-i-wake-director-spar-over-another-relativity-date-shuffle/">friction<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> between Relativity CEO Ryan Kavanaugh and director Mike Flanagan. Given that Relativity is now on life support, they can't set a new date. Though the film did finally manage to get a Blu-Ray and DVD release in Canada and the director of the film encouraged people in the U.S. who wanted to see the film to buy it, as the discs would work on all U.S. media players, the film also got a Netflix release everywhere on April 28th everywhere except the U.S. Fortunately, it seems that Relativity gave up on <em>Before I Wake</em> and Netflix finally released it in the US on January 5, 2018, barring a theatrical release.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1i70a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1i70a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1i70a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ironic</a> considering that Relativity previously sued Netflix as the streaming giant wanted to stream <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDisappointmentsRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDisappointmentsRoom">The Disappointments Room</a></em> and <em>Masterminds</em> ahead of their theatrical releases, and the studio argued that such a move would hurt their revenue.</span>
</li><li> Finally, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solace">Solace</a></em> was picked up by Relativity to be released sometime in 2015. Their bankruptcy ordeal prevented this from happening and once they were released from it they set a September 2, 2016 date for the film. Unfortunately as the year went on, Relativity found themselves unstable again and pulled the release. When their financial issues worsened, they dropped the film completely. Lionsgate/Grindstone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">rescued the film</a> and gave it a day-and-date limited theatrical/VOD release in December.
</li><li> When the company briefly emerged out of bankruptcy, they acquired the animated feature <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnimalCrackers2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnimalCrackers2017">Animal Crackers</a></em> and set a date for April 27, 2017. However, when the films they released post-bankruptcy failed in the box office, they were forced to drop the film from their pipeline. Once the rights were reverted back to the producers, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">carried over</a> the film to newcomer distributor Serafini Releasing, for a release on September 1, 2017. As it turned out, they too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">were finically struggling and incapable of releasing any film whatsoever</a>. So once again, the rights to the film were reverted back to the producers, who then gave Entertainment Studios the rights to release the film, but nothing came of it. Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> picked up the distribution rights, finally giving it a release date of July 24, 2020.
</li></ul></li><li> Dino De Laurentiis' DEG went into serious debt in 1987 after a series of financial flops and went bankrupt the following year, which impacted the releases of several of its later films. Most of them were bought by other companies and many others went straight-to-video, and others had their releases delayed irregardless of their eventual fates.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTed">Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</a></em> was shot in 1987 but didn't open until 1989, when the rights were purchased by (ironically) Orion. Since time travel is central to the plot, the film's director had to bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeanuReeves">Keanu Reeves</a> and Alex Winter in to redub a few lines to cover for the delay.
</li><li> <em>Collision Course</em>, a buddy cop movie starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatMorita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatMorita">Pat Morita</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JayLeno">Jay Leno</a> (in his only leading role) was filmed in 1987 and was reportedly never finished &#151; the money allegedly ran out on the last day of shooting &mdash; and the negatives were later seized by Wells Fargo Bank. It didn't see the light of day until 1992, when it was dumped onto video to capitalize upon Leno taking over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyCarson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyCarson">Johnny Carson</a>'s role as host of <em>The Tonight Show</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EarthGirlsAreEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EarthGirlsAreEasy">Earth Girls Are Easy</a></em> had it relatively easy (pardon the pun): It was shot over 1987-88, counting reshoots that took place over five months of post-production. Vestron Pictures picked it up, premiered it at that September's Toronto International Film Festival, and while legal issues prevented the planned February 1989 wide release from going on as planned, the delay was only to that May. (It probably helped that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeenaDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeenaDavis">Geena Davis</a>, who became an A-lister in '88, was the lead.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFriedkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFriedkin">William Friedkin</a>'s death penalty thriller <em>Rampage</em> was shot in 1986 but didn't open in the United States until 1992, having been released a few years earlier in some overseas territories (in Japan, it was released on LaserDisc in 1990, and these copies were imported into America prior to its release there). After Miramax picked it up, Friedkin recut the film and changed the ending (the international release got the original ending) due to his opinions on the death penalty changing since filming it. The film was delayed for so long that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EnnioMorricone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EnnioMorricone">Ennio Morricone</a>'s score album was out four years before the film was.
</li></ul></li><li> The acquisition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> generated complications for the release of a number of Fox projects that were in advanced or completed states, mostly so they wouldn't compete against Disney's big releases (Disney releases relatively few films each year, but has "flags planted" most months) in addition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>-enforced changes. For instance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AdAstra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AdAstra">Ad Astra</a></em> was completed in 2017, reshoots were ordered almost two years later and it came out in September 2019. Worse, the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNewMutants">The New Mutants</a></em>, which already had been postponed twice, was ultimately pushed back <em>two years</em> to April 2020 &#151; and unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkPhoenix">the X-Men movie</a> that was supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> but actually came out one year before <em>New Mutants</em>, it was not for reshoots, which already caused one of the prior delays. And then the movie was pushed back <em>again</em> due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</a> closing theatres. Pre-existing contracts meant the movie couldn't be released on VOD until <em>after</em> a theatrical release, barring Disney from simply releasing it online like several other movies affected by the closures. The movie finally made it to theatres on August 28, 2020.
</li><li> In addition to the above mentioned <em>New Mutants</em>, Disney also indefinitely delayed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SearchlightPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SearchlightPictures">Searchlight Pictures</a>' release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Antlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Antlers">Antlers</a></em> from its original release date of April 17 to February 19, 2021 due to the pandemic.

<ul><li> Two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a>'s biggest flops fell into this category: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfPlutoNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfPlutoNash">The Adventures of Pluto Nash</a></em>, which was completed in 2000 but not released until 2002; and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AThousandWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AThousandWords">A Thousand Words</a></em>, which wrapped in 2008 but was delayed until 2011, then 2012 when some parts of the ending were re-shot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHughes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HowardHughes">Howard Hughes</a>, being the head case that he was, had a few of his productions suffering from this.
<ul><li> The classic western <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedRiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedRiver">Red River</a></em> was filmed in 1946 but held for release for two years, in part due to legal problems with Hughes, who claimed it was similar to his <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOutlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOutlaw">The Outlaw</a></em>. It was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontgomeryClift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontgomeryClift">Montgomery Clift</a>'s first film, but <em>The Search</em> was released first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1932" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1932">Scarface (1932)</a></em> was completed in 1931, but its release was delayed almost a year due to Hughes's protracted battles with regional censor boards.
</li><li> <em>The Outlaw</em> was completed in 1941, but due to censorship issues, it wasn't released until 1946.
</li><li> <em>Jet Pilot</em> finished filming in 1953 (having started in 1949) and was finally released in 1957 due to Hughes tinkering with the film. By the time it was released, Hughes had sold RKO and Universal distributed the film.

The film finally made its US debut in 2000 on the USA Network.
</li><li> And this wasn't the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrittanyMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrittanyMurphy">Brittany Murphy</a> movie to meet such a fate &#150; <em>Something Wicked</em>, her final film, was made in 2009 and released in 2014&#133; five years after her death.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Anna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Anna">Anna</a></em> was completed in early 2018, but when accusations of sexual assault besieged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucBesson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucBesson">Luc Besson</a> amidst the #MeToo movement, the film was put on an indefinite hold. It did not receive a theatrical release until summer 2019, in the midst of a crowded holiday slate (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4">Toy Story 4</a></em> opened that week among others) with very little spent on marketing (no press junkets or screenings for critics) despite opening on over 2,000 screens. The tell-tale sign of the half-hearted release was that the film had the previous Summit Entertainment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate">Vanity Plate</a> (the outline of a mountain in a blue square) instead of the current iteration introduced in 2018, fashioned after the "in the clouds" plate of parent company Lionsgate.
</li><li> The coming-of-age drama <em>All Summers End</em> (which was previously titled <em>Grass Stains</em>) was made during the summer of 2013 but didn't get released until 2018. By then, lead actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TyeSheridan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TyeSheridan">Tye Sheridan</a> had become a bona fide star with two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse">high-profile</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne">blockbusters</a> to his name.

This is especially puzzling since the former grossed over $100 million and Peli has gone on to produce a number of profitable horror films (such as the sequels to <em>Paranormal Activity</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insidious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insidious">Insidious</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sinister">Sinister</a></em>).

It's currently unknown whose cut was picked for general release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AxEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AxEm">Ax 'Em</a></em> was filmed in 1992 and shown a few times in Baltimore, but fell into obscurity until 2002, where it was released straight to video and DVD, where again it fell into obscurity until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheCinemaSnob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheCinemaSnob">The Cinema Snob</a> reviewed it.

This proved to be a very good thing. Before it was released in 1946, scenes were added to capitalize further on the obvious on-screen chemistry of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HumphreyBogart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HumphreyBogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenBacall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenBacall">Lauren Bacall</a>.

Disney then delayed the film for seven months before quietly dumping it. This presumably happened because the climax involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">the threat of a passenger plane being bombed</a>, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the "terrorists" are really just crooks who stole a <em>nuclear bomb</em> without realizing what it was, and they accidentally turn it on while going through airport security.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrooklynsFinest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrooklynsFinest">Brooklyn's Finest</a></em> was completed in 2008 and premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, the film underwent reshoots through its original distributor but after said reshoots, the distributor went under. After spending a few months in distribution limbo, Overture Films (now the distribution outlet for Relativity Media) bought the film at a bankruptcy auction for $2 million, released it in March 2010 (four months after the original Thanksgiving date) and made a tidy profit.
</li><li> <em>Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star</em> was completed in 2009 but not released until 2011 due to poor test screenings and Columbia having little faith in it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffaloSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffaloSoldiers">Buffalo Soldiers</a></em> was originally intended to be released in late 2001, the movie was pushed back to 2003 after the September 11 attacks, as it was decided that a satire about the U.S. military would not go over well in the post-attack climate.

</li><li> Brazilian movie <em>Chat&ocirc;</em> is an amazing case, as it was mostly filmed in 1998 and 1999, but only got released in 2015 as in-between its director and production company were investigated for improper use of funds.

As editing neared completion civil war tore apart the region and much of the footage was lost.

</li><li> The English dub of the South Korean animated film <em>Dino Time</em> was meant to be released theatrically in 2012, but these plans were cancelled, possibly fearing competition from better movies. It went straight to DVD in Australia in 2013, then in 2015 it got released on a Blu-Ray/DVD set in the US and retitled <em>Back to the Jurassic</em> while in the UK it was released on DVD only and retained the original title.

It was released October 4, 2013, and did a $55.8 million opening. It went on to gross over 700 million dollars, and win 7 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a> including Best Director.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatestStoryEverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatestStoryEverTold">The Greatest Story Ever Told</a></em> began production in 1962 and was completed in 1963, but then went unreleased for another two years.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis">Jerry Lewis</a> film <em>Hardly Working</em> was completed in 1979 and finally released in 1981 to weak box-office and scathing reviews (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> gave it zero stars and called it "the greatest non-experience in my moviegoing life.") Similarly, <em>Smorgasbord</em> was shot over 1981-82 but not released anywhere until 1983, and then only direct-to-video in the U.S. as <em>Cracking Up</em>.
</li><li> <em>Heaven's Prisoners</em> was filmed in 1994, but was shelved for two years until its release in May of 1996 when Savoy Pictures, the film's original distributor, went bankrupt and New Line Cinema eventually picked it up for distribution.
</li><li> <em>Hippie Hippie Shake</em> was finished in 2007 but still has no release date planned. Some say it's because of the film's poor quality (though it did receive some good reviews at screenings), others say it's for insurance reasons due to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenZone">Green Zone</a></em> doing poorly and Universal not wanting to take a loss by releasing the film. Others believe that the real-life <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_Greer">Germaine Greer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (one of the central subjects of the film) had put the kibosh on the movie herself because she felt it was an inaccurate representation of her life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobZombie">Rob Zombie</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOf1000Corpses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOf1000Corpses">House of 1000 Corpses</a></em> was finished in 2000 and originally bought by Universal, but they shelved it as they were afraid the film's content would garner an NC-17 rating, so Zombie had to buy back the rights himself and sold it to Lionsgate, who finally released the film in 2003.
</li><li> The satirical thriller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHunt2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHunt2020">The Hunt</a></em> was due for a September 2019 release when two back-to-back mass shootings took place in Texas and Ohio, respectively, in early August of that year. In the wake of the tragedies, Universal pulled advertising for the film. Not helping matters was the backlash over the premise, which is a quasi-remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMostDangerousGame">The Most Dangerous Game</a></em> about rich "elitists" hunting down lower-class commoners for sport. An "unnamed source" told <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> that the film's predators are politically liberal and the prey are conservatives. This information, combined with the GOP's general animosity towards "liberal" Hollywood, led to a outcry from right-wing media and President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> despite them never having seen the film.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25lby');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25lby" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25lby');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or, for that matter, the <em>plot summary</em> Universal released, which implies that the audience is supposed to sympathize with characters being hunted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> insists that the movie is intended to portray extremism on both sides of the political spectrum.</span> Ultimately, Universal shelved the film, but later announced that it will finally be released on March 13, 2020.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movie</a> produced in 1953, by linking together "The Benefit", "Breaking the Lease", and "The Ballet" with new bookends and transitions. However, it didn't immediately receive a public release, to avoid competition with another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a>/Desi Arnaz comedy, <em>The Long, Long Trailer</em>. After becoming lost for decades, it finally received a screening at a 2001 <em>I Love Lucy</em> convention, DVD releases in 2007 and 2010, and a Blu-Ray release in 2015.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note39le1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note39le1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note39le1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">CBS Paramount first released the <em>I Love Lucy: The Movie</em> DVD as the bonus disc of an <em>I Love Lucy</em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LucyDesiComedyHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LucyDesiComedyHour">Lucy Desi Comedy Hour</a></em> Complete Series boxset, then later sold it by itself. The Blu-Ray release occurred when CBS Paramount included the movie as a bonus feature for <em>I Love Lucy</em> Season 2.</span>
</li><li> The film <em>I Love You, Daddy</em>, written, directed by, and starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisCK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisCK">Louis C.K.</a>, was originally set for a limited release on November 17, 2017, having attracted plenty of award-season buzz after being filmed in secret over the summer. However, it was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/louis-ck-i-love-you-daddy-timing-release">pulled indefinitely<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by its distributor just a week before it came out after C.K. was accused of, and subsequently confessed to, multiple instances of sexual harassment and lewd behavior, which only made the film's already-controversial subject matter (a TV producer tries to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHollywood">an older filmmaker/sexual predator</a> from sleeping with his teenage actress daughter) that much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Idiocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Idiocracy">Idiocracy</a></em> finished filming in 2004 and was dated for August 6, 2005, but was pulled off of Fox's schedule before finally getting released in September 1, 2006.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInterview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInterview">The Interview</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethRogen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethRogen">Seth Rogen</a>&#150;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFranco">James Franco</a> comedy about assassinating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korean</a> leader Kim Jong-un, just barely avoided becoming a victim of this trope. The film sparked outrage from North Korea almost immediately, with Pyongyang referring to it as an "act of war", and hackers (believed by the FBI to have been connected to North Korea, though some cyber-security experts believe it was an inside job from an ex-employee) attacked the servers of the film's studio, Sony Pictures, and released a mountain of emails and personal information. Then, cinema owners were sent an ominous message threatening terrorist attacks against cinemas that chose to screen the film. Sony originally left it up to cinema chains to decide for themselves, but when all five major chains backed out, Sony pulled the film's release. Many people (including President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>) felt that the decision was a mistake and accused Sony and the theaters of appeasing terrorists, and many petitions to Sony to show the film were created, with at least one gathering hundreds of signatures. The intense backlash persuaded Sony executives to change their minds and give the film a limited theatrical/VOD release on Christmas Day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvisibleMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvisibleMom">Invisible Mom</a></em> was completed in 1995, but not released until 1997, and then only to VHS.
</li><li> <em>Iron Shadows</em> was a low-budget adaptation of the public domain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronShadowsInTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronShadowsInTheMoon">Iron Shadows in the Moon</a></em>, starring Finnish hockey player Pasi Schalin as Conan. Production went smoothly in 2014 until it was discovered that producer George Tan &mdash; a shady online distributor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a> movies &mdash; had not sorted out complex rights issues with the then-current owner of the Conan property, Paradox Entertainment. Tan suddenly disappeared, <em>Iron Shadows</em> was put on the shelf despite being otherwise completed, and the film has lingered in limbo ever since. Bootleg versions can be viewed online, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JupiterAscending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JupiterAscending">Jupiter Ascending</a></em> was completed in 2013, but wasn't released until two years later, in 2015. Warner Bros. claimed it was done to give the Wachowskis more time to do the effects and the Wachowksis didn't use that extra time to do re-shoots, instead leaving it in stasis until Warner Bros. finally decided to release it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> finished a cut <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">out of compromise with executives</a> with what he filmed for <em>Justice League</em>. That seemingly wasn't enough for them and after Snyder's departure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> was hired to write and direct reshoots more to their liking. The resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">theatrical cut</a> scrapped much of what Snyder filmed, and the studio proceeded with the following movies without caring about <em>Justice League</em> any further. In 2020, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague">Zack Snyder's Justice League</a></em> was announced. It will release in 2021 and feature the scrapped footage including much of the initial cut Snyder submitted, none of the Whedon additions, and new special effects.
</li><li> The horror film <em>Keep Watching</em> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne">Bella Thorne</a> was shot in 2013, but it wasn't picked up for distribution until two years later by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScreenGems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScreenGems">Screen Gems</a>. They set a December 2, 2016, release date for the film and released a poster to boot. Not long later, they pulled it from their yearly schedule and aimed for a March 24, 2017, date instead. A short time later, they pulled the release again and finally a trailer popped up in August and the film got a release date for October 31st.
</li><li> <em>The King's Daughter</em>, based off the 1997 novel <em>The Moon and the Sun</em> by Vonda McIntyre, completed filming at the end of May 2014 with Focus Pictures distributing the film in the United States as <em>The Moon and the Sun</em>. Then on August 15, 2014, Paramount Pictures bought the U.S. distribution rights and announced a release date of April 10, 2015, then for some reason no trailers were released until three weeks before release, Paramount decided to cancel the release date and later put the film on turnaround with Open Road Films buying the rights and retitled the film as <em>The King's Daughter</em> with no release date in sight.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limelight">Limelight</a></em> was pulled from distribution after he was denied re-admittance to the United States for allegedly having Communist sympathies. Filmed in 1952, it was finally released in the United States in 1972. It had already been released in Europe.
</li><li> <em>Little Fockers</em>, the second sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetTheParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeetTheParents">Meet the Parents</a></em>, was released in 2010, however it was filmed in late 2008/early 2009 (in fact, AOL News at the time had posted on-set photos of the film). Primarily the reason for the delay was due to Dustin Hoffman changing his mind about appearing in the film (originally he opted not to), so the release date was pushed back so scenes with Hoffman's character Bernie could be filmed. The only thing that really sticks out related to the delay is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro">Robert de Niro</a>'s character being shown using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a>, a social networking site that had lost a good chunk of popularity to Facebook by 2010.
</li><li> <em>The Loft</em>, Belgian director Erik Van Looy's remake of his own 2008 erotic mystery film, was completed in 2011 with Dark Castle Entertainment picking up the U.S. distribution rights with the intent of releasing the movie through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> in early-to-mid 2012. However, in April 2012, producer and Dark Castle co-head Joel Silver ended his deal with Warner Bros., taking his studio and the movie with him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a>. The film's release date was pushed back several times by Universal over the next two years until August 29, 2014 was settled. However, Universal pulled the film from it's schedule <em>two months</em> before release. Dark Castle quietly erased the movie from its website, with Silver's name removed from credits. The film was eventually released in Belgium in October, after which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OpenRoadFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OpenRoadFilms">Open Road Films</a> picked up the U.S. distribution rights. It was finally released on January 30, 2015 to scathing reviews, bombed at the box office despite having a $15 million budget, and was pulled from most of the 1,841 theaters after two weeks.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4rkqq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4rkqq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4rkqq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Universal still released the film on DVD due to their deal with Open Road.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLongGoodFriday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLongGoodFriday">The Long Good Friday</a></em> was completed in 1979, but its release was delayed for a year due to a change in distributors. The film was originally produced by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewGrade">Lew Grade</a> and was to be an ITC production, but he pulled the plug when he realised that the plot involved the IRA. It was then bought by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> and released through <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandMadeFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandMadeFilms">Hand Made Films</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LuckyYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LuckyYou">Lucky You</a></em> was shot in 2005 and not released until 2007, where it flopped at the box office.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarciX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarciX">Marci X</a></em> was completed in August 2002 but didn't get released until a year later (August 2003) where it opened to mostly negative reviews and did poorly at the box-office.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaPaquin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaPaquin">Anna Paquin</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattDamon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattDamon">Matt Damon</a> drama <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Margaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Margaret">Margaret</a></em> was filmed in 2005 but because of a combination of lawsuits and the inability to deliver a final cut, didn't see a release until 2011. The released version (running a whopping 153 minutes) barely made it out of New York and Los Angeles and became one of the lowest-grossing releases in the history of 20th Century Fox.
</li><li> Yuri Kara's movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMasterAndMargarita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMasterAndMargarita">The Master and Margarita</a></em> was filmed in 1994 but released in 2011, six years after that <em>other</em> adaptation by Vladimir Bortko.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeAndOrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeAndOrsonWelles">Me and Orson Welles</a></em> premiered to great acclaim at the 2008 Toronto Film Festival, but was unable to secure a distributor despite the considerable buzz and the fact that they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacEfron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacEfron">Zac Efron</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaireDanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaireDanes">Claire Danes</a> as the stars. It was eventually released to perhaps a dozen cinemas nationwide in November 2009 and almost promptly forgotten (its release on DVD was even <em>more</em> delayed). Many fans claim that this piss-poor release strategy ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub">robbing</a> co-star Christian McKay of a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his performance as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a>.

But the eventual product was a victim of the shelf, having <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/06/01/the_monster_trucks_trailer_will_leave_you_speechless.html">its release date moved four times<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, ultimately settling for January 2017 &mdash; i.e. the very definition of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpMonths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpMonths">Dump Month</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Movie43" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Movie43">Movie 43</a></em> began production in 2009 and was intended to ready for a 2010 release. Then original distributor Overture Films sold the rights (and later had everything at the studio but the name sold) to Relativity Media, who continued to keep it in-and-out of production (missing a planned Spring 2012 date) until finally releasing it in 2013.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedWitch">The Naked Witch</a></em> was shot in 1960, copyrighted in 1961, but not released until 1964.

Decades later, producer Wade Williams bought the rights to the film, paid the fees, and released it on video in 1984.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NineAndAHalfWeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NineAndAHalfWeeks">9&frac12; Weeks</a></em> sat on the shelf for a year after it was finished because the studio couldn't figure out how to market it, nor what they could cut to avoid an X rating.
</li><li> <em>Not Safe for Work</em> (Joe Johnston's follow-up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em>) had been finished since 2012 but was held from domestic theatrical release due to studio politics at Universal (the film was originally planned for theatrical release and then a straight-to-DVD release in April 2014). The film was then released to home video in May 2014.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNutcrackerIn3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNutcrackerIn3D">The Nutcracker in 3D</a></em> was filmed in 2007, but not released until 2010. The delay was partly to allow for the afterthought of converting it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie">3-D Movie</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/O" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/O">"O"</a></em>, the modern day retelling of Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em>, was originally supposed to be released in spring 1999, but then Columbine happened, and the thought of releasing a film which featured gun violence amongst high school students so soon afterwards was unthinkable, so the film didn't see the light of day until more than two years later in August 2001. This wound up helping the film, as during the two-year delay, Julia Stiles's profile skyrocketed as one of the hottest young stars in Hollywood, thanks to the 1-2 combo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenThingsIHateAboutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenThingsIHateAboutYou">10 Things I Hate About You</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveTheLastDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveTheLastDance">Save the Last Dance</a></em>, and was able to add a little more star power to the product upon release.

When it finally did find one, the film got tied up in legal lawsuits as a result of the marketing department not promoting the film like they were supposed to, it eventually got a DVD release in 2014.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OldDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OldDogs">Old Dogs</a></em> was made in 2007, but it wasn't released until late 2009 because of two delays. First, after the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernieMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernieMac">Bernie Mac</a>, who had a small part in it (this was the last movie he ever worked on), in August of 2008, and again in early 2009 after the death of star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnTravolta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnTravolta">John Travolta</a>'s son Jett.

</li><li> Principle production for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ophelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ophelia">Ophelia</a></em> was completed on July 6th 2017 and the film premiered at Sundance on 22nd January 2018, but it didn't receive a theatrical release until June 28th 2019, over a year after the premiere. It apparently took a while to find distributors; it didn't get a UK distributor until mid-August 2019 (nearly two months after the US).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParisWhenItSizzles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParisWhenItSizzles">Paris When It Sizzles</a></em> was completed in 1962, but the studio didn't think much of it and shelved it until 1964 when it was released mainly to cash in on the success of another Paris-set movie starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Charade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Charade">Charade</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoneBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoneBooth">Phone Booth</a></em> was completed in 2000 and got delayed in post-production, it was supposed to be released in 2002, but was delayed until 2003 because of the Beltway Snipers rampage.

The reason? Ed couldn't pay to have the film developed and it was withheld by the lab.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahMichelleGellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> film <em>Possession</em> (which was a remake of the South Korean film <em>Addicted</em>) was filmed in 2007 and scheduled for a theatrical release in winter 2008, but the film's distribution company ended up going bankrupt, which caused the release date to get pushed back nearly a dozen times until it was finally released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> in March 2010 (and given the lackluster reviews, it's probably for the best).
</li><li> <em>Pride And Glory</em> was shelved for two years before getting a release date in 2008.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectAlmanac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectAlmanac">Project Almanac</a></em> was filmed in 2013 with a planned February 28, 2014 release date. However, Paramount delayed it <em>a few weeks</em> before its scheduled release. The film was then released on January 2015 (and it underwent a title change. Prior to the delay, the original title was <em>Welcome to Yesterday</em>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RadioFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RadioFlyer">Radio Flyer</a></em> was originally intended as Columbia's big movie for the summer of 1991 &mdash; odd in hindsight given its B-level cast, lack of big special effects, and grim subject matter for a family film. The release date was constantly shuffled due to reshoots, production delays, and finally bad test screenings. Eventually, the film was quietly released in February 1992 and was a critically-savaged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaiseTheTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaiseTheTitanic">Raise the Titanic!</a></em> was finished in 1978 but not released until 1980.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedTails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedTails">Red Tails</a></em> suffered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> from the '80s until 2007, and even after it was in the can and ready to go in 2010, it took another couple years before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> could find a distributor willing to take it. The reason Lucas gave for both the decades-long hell and this trope was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorityShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorityShowGhetto">the cast was mostly black</a>. Other sources claim that Lucas was demanding an unreasonably large portion of the international grosses as part of the deal.
</li><li> <em>Renegades</em>, a $75 <em>million</em> action film directed by Steven Quale, completed filming in 2015 and was going to be released on July 15, 2016, but the release has been pushed back multiple times and was going to be released on September 1st, 2017, but due to the commercial failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ValerianAndTheCityOfAThousandPlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ValerianAndTheCityOfAThousandPlanets">Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets</a></em> and financial problems in July, Europacorp decided to shelve the U.S. release to an undetermined date. The movie has eventually been released in international markets with horrible box office results only gaining $2,602,149. The film eventually got a U.S. release on December 21, 2018, albeit dumped to VOD.

The film was shot between March and June 2015 and originally scheduled to be released on November 13, 2015. The film was pulled from the schedule two months before it was supposed to come out, and rescheduled for April 1, 2016. A month before <em>that</em> date, it was pushed back to October 28, 2016. A month before it was supposed to come out, it was delayed once again, this time to February 3, 2017.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunRonnieRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunRonnieRun">Run Ronnie Run</a></em> was completed in 2001 but was shelved until 2003, when it was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> due to New Line losing faith in the film.
</li><li> <em>Same Kind of Different as Me</em> completed filming in December 2014 and had a release date for April 29, 2016 but Paramount Pictures decided to push back the date to February 3, 2017 a month before release. Then on December 30th, 2016, Paramount decided to place the film on turnaround and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PureFlixEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PureFlixEntertainment">Pure Flix Entertainment</a> picked up the distribution rights and now has a release date for October 20, 2017.

Then the visual effects studio went bankrupt. They were paid off to complete their work anyhow, but a 3D conversion and the severance of a relationship between distributor Warner Bros. and the production company (and thus the switch to Universal) delayed the movie's eventual American release to February 2015 (though it had come out a couple of months earlier in some international markets).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shane">Shane</a></em> was completed in 1951, but it wasn't released until two years later due to extensive re-editing.

Unfortunately in December 2017, Spurlock committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">career suicide</a> by confessing to past acts of sexual misconduct on Twitter. As a result, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> dropped the film and it was pulled from a planned screening at Sundance. Eventually, Samuel Goldwyn Films, co-distributor of the original, picked it up, and the film is now set for a September 2019 release.

It was intended for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> release in 1989, but a fire at the distribution warehouse destroyed nearly all copies of the film and the master print, and it was presumed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">lost</a>. However, a few bootlegs, stripped of the opening and closing credits denoting it as a work of fiction, survived and found their way into the ufologist community in the early '90s, whereupon the film was mistaken for a real account of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">Alien Abduction</a> and came to be known as "the McPherson tape". The film's cult status as an underground hit on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> circuit led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">made-for-TV</a> remake in 1998 titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienAbductionIncidentInLakeCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienAbductionIncidentInLakeCounty">Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County</a></em>, and writer/director Dean Alioto finally got it a proper home video release in 2018. The truly bizarre story of its release, however, simply built up its mystique, and to this day, there are people who claim that Alioto's story and <em>Incident in Lake County</em> are a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionAsCoverUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionAsCoverUp">Fiction as Cover-Up</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelFuller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelFuller">Samuel Fuller</a>'s racism drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteDog">White Dog</a></em> was filmed in 1981 but Paramount shelved it due to uneasiness over the film's content and it would not be released until it was quietly sneaked onto the Lifetime network (yes, <em>that</em> Lifetime) in 1987. The film would not see a home video release until 2010, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection">The Criterion Collection</a> released it on DVD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Whiteout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Whiteout">Whiteout</a></em> was completed in 2007, but didn't get released until September 2009, where it received negative reviews and poor box office returns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoureNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoureNext">You're Next</a></em> was filmed in 2011 and had a very well-received premiere at the Toronto Film Festival that September (the film's resulting bidding war would later influence the festival to go for a more youth-oriented style in future years). After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lionsgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Lionsgate">Lionsgate</a> won the bid, they announced a Fall 2012 opening with a large-scale release. However, Lionsgate buying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SummitEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SummitEntertainment">Summit Entertainment</a> and a bad test screening (director Adam Wingard's handheld shooting style has done well with festival audiences but American audiences haven't been keen on it) led Lionsgate to shelve the film and push it back to August 2013.
</li><li> Due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, <strong>many movies</strong> scheduled for release in March 2020 and later have been delayed, some indefinitely, since going to a movie theatre basically entails having dozens of total strangers to sit in close proximity for a two to three hour stretch. This left quite a few big-budget tentpole films&#151;namely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mulan2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mulan2020">Mulan (2020)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tenet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tenet">Tenet</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoTimeToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoTimeToDie">No Time to Die</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackWidow2021" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackWidow2021">Black Widow (2021)</a></em>&#151;in an unusual position of being completed but unable to be released.

</li><li> A remake of the miniseries <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sybil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sybil">Sybil</a></em> was filmed in 2007 and got an European release that year, but it wasn't aired in the US until it was burned off one Saturday night in June 2008.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> picked up <em>Day One</em>, a show that involves apartment residents banding together after an unknown cataclysm destroys the world. It was supposed to air in 2010 with 13 episodes, but was cut to four episodes, then turned into a TV movie (the NBC head said that they would make a TV series if the movie did well). Eventually NBC lost hope in the series/movie and never aired it. The only footage people can see is the trailer.

The episode, which condemned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s attacks on critics of racism and police brutality in the wake of the NFL "kneeling" controversy, was shelved for allegedly being too "politically charged." However, critics of the shelving, including <em>Blackish</em> showrunner Kenya Barris, felt that ABC was becoming too sympathetic to Republicans and less sympathetic towards Democrats (the network had allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseanneBarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseanneBarr">Roseanne Barr</a> to turn her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> revival into her own pro-Trump soapbox), and such indignation led to Barris leaving the show at the end of the season. Ultimately, Hulu streamed the episode in August 2020, in which by that point anti-racism protests had become widespread in the wake of several high-profile murders of Black people by cops.

Come 2012, and a similar show named <em>3</em> debuts; that series nonetheless bombed in the ratings and was axed after two airings.
</li><li> <em>Beyond Tomorrow</em>, the documentary about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTomorrowPeople1973">The Tomorrow People (1973)</a></em>, was completed in 1997, but didn't see release until <em>2005</em>.

It was originally scheduled to air in summer 2009, but delayed to early 2010 before being shelved permanently. However, it did air on MTV channels in Australia and New Zealand in its entirety.
</li><li> <em>Buy It Now</em> was originally slated to be part of ABC's summer 2006 lineup; however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay">eBay</a> pulled out of the series' participation before it debuted, resulting in its cancellation.
</li><li> <em>Do You Trust Me?</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> game show hosted by Tucker Carlson, shot six episodes in 2007, but didn't make it to the air at all.

Although a promo was aired (as was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5QYefzSj_I">an affiliate primer on the show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the show itself was abruptly replaced by a rerun of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWayansBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWayansBros">The Wayans Bros.</a></em>. UKGameShows claims that a whole series was made for The WB, but that might be false info. It was remade for Germany the following year as the one-off <em>Zappenduster</em>.

</li><li> <em>Marie</em>, a syndicated talk show hosted by Marie Osmond, was scheduled to debut in the fall of 2009. However, despite being cleared in 80% of the country, it was withdrawn by Program Partners over a month before it even debuted, leading to several affiliates dropping the series as well. However, in 2012, it finally made it to air on the Hallmark Channel.
</li><li> There have been two versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em> that were picked up but not aired:
<ul><li> In 2004, Fox ordered <em>What the Blank!</em>, which was more faithful to the 1970s version but added a "interview on the street" segments, therefore making it <em>Match Game</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">meets</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StreetSmarts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StreetSmarts">Street Smarts</a></em>. It was scrapped not long thereafter, and it's unknown how many episodes were actually made.
</li><li> Another revival was announced by TBS in 2008, but beyond being mentioning in subsequent press conferences, nothing has been heard of that series ever since. <em>Match Game</em> was finally revived for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> in 2016.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OurLittleGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OurLittleGenius">Our Little Genius</a></em> was a game show produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkBurnett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkBurnett">Mark Burnett</a> and hosted by Kevin Pollak, that was supposed to premiere in January 2010 with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> as a lead-in. However, a week before its debut, it was pulled at Burnett's request due to concerns about integrity; Fox would eventually shelve the series for good.
</li><li> <em>Surprise with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennyMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennyMcCarthy">Jenny McCarthy</a></em> was announced in May 2012, only to be scrapped in January 2013.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> ordered the reality game series <em>The Frame</em> in late 2010, and nothing has been heard of it since.
</li><li> After being picked up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a> in 2007, <em>When Women Rule the World</em> got delayed <em>three times</em>; it was planned to debut that summer, then pushed back to early 2008, then to June 2008, before the network ended up pulling the plug on the series for good. However, the United Kingdom did get their own version of the show on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4">Channel 4</a> in September 2008.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> axed <em>Welcome to the Neighborhood</em> before it aired in the summer of 2005, likely due to its inappropriate subject matter.
</li><li> <em>Who's Your Daddy?</em>, another Fox reality show that involved an adopted woman trying to identify her biological father among a group of impostors, technically did air once, but was shown as a "special", not a "series premiere". The 90-minute episode tanked in the ratings, causing Fox to shelve the remaining five episodes, though they did later air on FOX's Reality TV spin-off cable channel FOX Reality. Not helping matters was that WRAZ, Raleigh's Fox affiliate, refused to air it at all due to the controversy from adoption rights organizations.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> recorded the songs which became the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe">Let It Be</a></em> in 1969 but then shelved the whole thing and went back to the studio, producing and releasing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad">Abbey Road</a></em> in 1969. After Phil Spector dug through the tapes and finished the songs, <em>Let It Be</em> (along with its accompanying film) was released in 1970.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a> signed with Atlantic Records in 1973 he recorded two albums worth of material at the same sessions. One was his first "outlaw country" album <em>Shotgun Willie</em>, the other was a gospel album called <em>The Troublemaker</em>. Nelson actually thought <em>The Troublemaker</em> turned out the better of the two, but Atlantic didn't think a gospel album would sell so they shelved it. After releasing one more album on Atlantic (<em>Phases &amp; Stages</em>) he moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords">Columbia Records</a>, and Atlantic let him have the master tapes for <em>The Troublemaker</em>, which he finally released on Columbia in 1976.
</li><li> It's common for an artist to record an album for one label, have it go unreleased due to poor performance of its singles, then finally have the album come out once the artist makes it big on another label. Examples:
<ul><li> Both Big Kenny and John Rich (then-recently fired from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a>) recorded solo albums in the late 1990s.

</li><li> Due to poor performance of its singles, Marty Stuart's 1988 album <em>Let There Be Country</em> was not released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords">Columbia Records</a> until he had a few hits under his belt over at MCA in the early 90s.
</li><li> David Ball recorded an album for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RCARecords">RCA Records</a> in the 80s, but it wasn't released at the time. After he had a big hit with <em>Thinkin' Problem</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords">Warner (Bros.) Records</a> in 1994, RCA released the album they were holding onto.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Motorhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Motorhead">Mot&ouml;rhead</a> recorded their first album for United Artists, who refused to release it because they considered it poor quality. After the band rose to fame (with a different record company and everyone other than Lemmy replaced), UA released it as <em>On Parole</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sarah Buxton released her debut single "Innocence" in 2006. It and her next two singles didn't do very well, so her album sat for <em>four years</em> before it was released (although she did put out an EP in the interim). Then her label closed right after the album finally got out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> recorded the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum">Cover Album</a> <em>Kojak Variety</em> in 1990 but didn't release it until 1995.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> recorded a 10-song album in 2012 with producer T-Bone Burnett, as the followup to 2010's critically acclaimed, Burnett-produced collaboration with Leon Russell, <em>The Union</em>. It was made as a lean, "back-to-basics" work with emphasis on his piano-playing, largely built around the piano-bass-drums sound Elton adopted in concert in the early 1970's, prior to his successful "glam period". After attempting a May 2012 release date, it was moved to 2013 to allow for better promotional potential. In the meantime, he and lyricist Bernie Taupin noticed a thematic continuity running through most of the songs, wrote a few new songs and discarded one of the originals. The album title was changed to <em>Voyeur</em>, then back to its original title, <em>The Diving Board</em>. It was released in September 2013, and peaked at #4 on the Billboard 200.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>' career-defining masterpiece <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Smile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Smile">Smile</a></em>, in probably the most famous example of this trope in music history, sat around for nearly <em>forty-five years</em> past its intended release date of January 1967, always in different states of completion due to Brian Wilson's obsessive tinkering. The album was finally released to mark the band's fiftieth anniversary in a massive 5 CD's + 2 45's + 2 LP's box. (Seven years prior, Wilson had done a solo version of <em>Smile</em> that greatly influenced the eventual Beach Boys release).
</li><li> Eleven years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chumbawamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chumbawamba">Chumbawamba</a>'s 1992 album <em>Jesus H. Christ</em> was buried by a mountain of legal issues, the band announced on their website that they would be releasing it in some form or another in the near future. This never happened. (Given that it likely would've been shorn of its samples &mdash; and thus would've resembled the <em>Shhh</em> album again &mdash; this was probably for the best.)
</li><li> <em>Black Bastards</em> by KMD, a group featuring a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MFDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MFDoom">MF Doom</a> as Zev Love X, was ready for release in 1993, but was shelved until 2001 due to the label's fear of the album's racial content. By the time it was finally released, DOOM's brother Subroc was dead and DOOM had begun his more well-known solo career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a>'s <em>Tonight's the Night</em> was recorded in 1973, but shelved by the record label because they thought it was too uncommercial. It was eventually released as submitted to the label two years later, and while it didn't sell well to begin with, it was almost immediately canonised as a masterpiece.
</li><li> The first Mahavishnu Orchestra's third album was recorded in 1973, but languished in a vault because the band couldn't agree on the value of the album (band leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMcLaughlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMcLaughlin">John McLaughlin</a> always maintained it was the best thing they ever recorded). It was <em>finally</em> released in 1999.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>'s <em>L&auml;ther</em> was submitted to Warner Brothers in 1977, but due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, was not released as submitted until 1996. The material intended to be released on the four-LP set was instead divided between four albums, one of them itself a double LP set.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>'s <em>Out Among the Stars</em> was recorded in 1981 and 1984, but the material was shelved by Columbia Records. A small handful of additional recordings were done in 2013 after Cash's death and the album was finally released in 2014.
</li><li> Diana Ross recorded an album titled <em>Diana Ross Sings Songs From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz">The Wiz</a></em>, after landing the role of Dorothy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWiz">the 1978 movie version of the musical</a>. Motown originally intended to release the album about a year after the movie's premiere, but decided against it after the film flopped. It finally saw a digital release in November 2015, exactly one week before NBC televised a new adaptation of <em>The Wiz</em> (which Diana Ross didn't participate in, for the record).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKentuckyHeadhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKentuckyHeadhunters">The Kentucky Headhunters</a> recorded <em>Meet Me in Bluesland</em> with blues pianist Johnnie Johnson (their second collaboration with him) in 2003, but did not release it until 2015.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> suddenly cancelled the release of his much-anticipated <em>The Black Album</em> in 1987, after apparently becoming convinced that its content was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">spiritually evil</a>. As some copies had already been sent out to press reviewers, the album ended up getting bootlegged on a massive scale. Prince finally changed his mind and allowed it to be released in 1994.
<ul><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a>, Prince had completed over fifty fully-produced music videos with sets and costumes that have never the light of day.
</li></ul></li><li> British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> group Tonight had their first single "Drummerman" reach number 14 on the British singles charts &mdash; they completed an album in 1978, but it was shelved (perhaps because subsequent singles weren't as successful). The album, also titled <em>Drummerman</em>, finally saw release on an independent label in 2010.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a> completed what was meant to be their first album in 1991, and its release was meant to launch a record label founded by its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">Record Producer</a>, Ross Robinson &mdash; the band didn't like the details of their record contract and wouldn't sign it, so the album was shelved. Robinson kept the commercial rights to the recording, so the band used a copy as a demo tape, got signed by Roadrunner Records, and re-recorded eight of its songs for their proper debut, <em>Soul Of A New Machine</em>. Eleven years later, the recordings came out on Roadrunner, unsanctioned by the band, and given the new title <em>Concrete</em> &mdash; according to Burton C. Bell, Robinson had sold the album to Roadrunner, who in turn released it when the band broke up one album short of their contractual obligation with the label.
</li><li> Necromandus' debut <em>Orexis Of Death</em>, boasting production by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Tony Iommi</a>, was recorded in 1973. The album was shelved when their lead guitarist left the group, only to eventually get an official release in 1999.

They were signed to Geffen Records, had an album all set and ready to be released in 2001 and were even touring to promote it. The problem? Geffen got bought out by Universal, which caused <em>Break Your Silence</em> to suffer continuous delays and eventually not be released (helps that while Cinder got some compensation from the label once they decided to terminate their contract, they did not want to buy the master tapes for $250,000). To add insult to injury, they DID end up releasing one song off the album called "Soul Creation" which ended up charting and having a fairly popular video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>' long form music video for their EP <em>Broken</em> (called <em>The Broken Movie</em>) was shelved as Trent Reznor didn't want the extreme graphic content overshadowing the music itself; the individual music videos aside from 'Gave Up' (which is apart of the plotline of the video's wraparound segments) were later made available on the second tape of the <em>Closure</em> video album. As for <em>The Broken Movie</em> itself, Reznor gave copies of the video to various friends, albiet with certain sections missing, with one copy in particular being circulated in bootleg form for years before a DVD-quality leak was uploaded to the internet (which Reznor implied to have done himself in a blogpost around the time). The movie was also breifly uploaded to NIN's official Vimeo account in both 2013 and 2014, but both times it was removed.

It also came out a year after the final PC-FX game, which meant that the PC-Engine technically outlived its successor.

This is not the first time they've done this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames">PlatinumGames</a>, but this time it's especially noticeable due to the game's heavy emphasis on online multiplayer.

It was delayed one more time to April 2017 with the dev team claiming it was in part in order to record previously unvoiced lines. Eyebrows were raised when reviews started coming out in March, reviewers implied they actually had the game for weeks, and said unvoiced lines were still unvoiced...

This wasn't a big deal in itself, and a demo came out in February that let everyone enjoy a taste of the game. It then turned out that the demo actually <em>was</em> an accidental upload of the complete game, and the game was just delayed in order to buff the start of Sega's next financial year instead of legitimately not being ready &mdash; which is probably what happened to <em>P5</em> too.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em> was set and ready to go for November 2013, but got bumped to February 2014 specifically because 2013 already had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">stacked</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">holiday</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">lineup</a>, while otherwise the Wii U's 2014 would have had absolutely nothing until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em>, which came out at the end of <em>May</em>. This actually worked out, since the game involves Donkey Kong's birthday and 2014 marked the <em>DKC</em> series' 20th anniversary.
</li><li> This has become especially obvious starting in the Wii U and 3DS era when preloads for digital games became more common. Multiple Nintendo games have been available for preload months before their official release date. Infamously, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioColorSplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioColorSplash">Paper Mario: Color Splash</a></em>'s preload was an accidental unlocked version of <em>the complete game</em> two weeks ahead of its intended release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> HD</em> was spotted on eShop servers in October 2015. It came out in March 2016 in order to celebrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">the game's 10th anniversary and the series's 30th</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisWoollyWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisWoollyWorld">Yoshi's Woolly World</a></em> was notoriously delayed in North America until October 2015. Europe and Australia got the game in June, four months earlier, and the two versions are virtually identical. It looks like this is happening again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisCraftedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisCraftedWorld">Yoshi's Crafted World</a></em>, which officially comes out March 29, 2019. It was uploaded to the eShop in <em>December 2018</em>. Funny enough though, this is probably happening for exact opposite reasons &mdash; <em>Woolly World</em> to fill out a slim holiday lineup in NA, and <em>Crafted World</em> to get away from the four-hit combo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioParty">Super Mario Party</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonLetsGoPikachuAndLetsGoEevee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonLetsGoPikachuAndLetsGoEevee">Pok&eacute;mon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros.

The PSP version never saw the light of day outside Japan, but the localized script and English VA track were used for <em>Type-0 HD</em> in 2015.
</li><li> Atlus's lack of a dedicated European branch or partner caused this to happen to their games for a long time. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">Shin Megami Tensei IV</a></em> is the most notorious example. It had the fastest turnaround of any Atlus game from Japan to NA, coming out only two months apart. The European release took well over a year with no information, and finally came out in October 2014. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">Using the exact same English localization as NA with no other language options added in the wait, and digital only</a>.

As a result, Vanillaware's second game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimGrimoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimGrimoire">GrimGrimoire</a></em>, which was instead published by Nippon Ichi, actually came out first.
</li><li> The aggressive inline skating game <em>Rolling</em> ended up in limbo for several months after developer Rage Software went defunct in early 2003, when the game was nearing completion. It took publisher SCi assembling a team of former Rage devs to finish off the game (under the name "Indy Games") for it to finally release in October that year.
</li><li> The development team for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilEngine">Devil Engine</a></em> has said that the the <em>Devil Engine Ignition</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> (which includes, among other things, a completely new campaign) is completed, and it was supposed to be released in winter of 2019 (i.e. December 2019). Unfortunately, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DangenEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DangenEntertainment">Dangen Entertainment</a> taking the rights to the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">away from Protocult</a>, it remains to be seen when and if <em>Ignition</em> will finally get released.

When they finally did in 2015, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> had long since superseded with Wii, leading them to port the game to that system themselves, with Prope's original version remaining only as a bonus feature.
</li><li> <em>Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans</em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> style adventure made by blizzard and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation_Magic">Animation Magic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (mostly infamous for being the guys behind the cutscenes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames">The Legend Of Zelda C Di Games</a>) that was meant to be an official sequel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> II. The game was around 90% complete and set for a release date in late 1997 when Blizzzard decided it wasn't up to their standards, and ordered the game to be reworked. Conflict between the two companies meant even further delays though, leading to it's cancelation in 1998. The plot was instead reworked into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheClans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheClans">a book</a> and the game was mostly forgotten untill it was leaked in 2016 by a former worker at Animation Magic.

However, over the course of production in 2015, Jones discovered that the film's lead actor, Jake Norvell, was having an affair with Jones's girlfriend. When Norvell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">pompously bragged about it</a>, Jones promptly fired him from the film, which became unreleaseable both due to Norvell's contract and the fact that about 5% of his scenes were not completed. Despite an attempt to resume production, which included a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0hIV9ohLyE">teaser trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> promising a 2017 release, Jones later <a class="urllink" href="http://reallybradjones.tumblr.com/post/159578286694/speaking-of-shot-on-shitteo-has-that-came-out-yet">announced<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the film was no longer in active development and he had no plans one way or the other regarding its release.

<ul><li> The first season was completed in 1999 and was set for a Fall 2000 premiere date (all of season one's episodes have a copyright notice of 2000). Besides the first episode premiering as a sneak peek on December 31, 1999, Nickelodeon held it off until 2002.
</li><li> The fourth (and final) season stopped premiering in June 2005 with six episodes left. It wasn't until June 2008 that Nick decided to burn-off the remaining episodes at six in the morning on Saturdays without any advertisement. This only applies to the US airings &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">the remaining six season four episodes aired with the rest of the season overseas</a>.

Like <em>I Love You, Daddy</em>, the show was yanked before its release after C.K.'s sexual misconduct came to light. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloseEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloseEnough">Close Enough</a></em>, an unrelated show meant to premiere in the same block as a companion series, never made it to TV, being held back to become HBO Max's first original adult animated series two years later (and surprisingly had more episodes greenlit afterward).
</li><li> The last six episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em> were completed sometime in 2014, but didn't air in the United States until 2019, due to the show's waning popularity and the rise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em>'s own popularity. This is made more awkward thanks to some of these episodes being intended as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffSendoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffSendoff">set up to the spin-off show</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraAndFriendsIntoTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraAndFriendsIntoTheCity">Dora and Friends: Into the City!</a></em>... with that show having ended its own run in 2017.

<ul><li> "Parents Day", a season 3 episode that aired in the UK in late 1998, didn't end up airing in the US until May 2000, as part of season <em>5</em>.
</li><li> Season 1 had 26 episodes produced for it, but only 20 were actually used. Out of the remaining six episodes, five aired at the end of season 2, and one aired in late season 3. This created some continuity errors, since Arnold's teacher Miss Slovak was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and replaced at the beginning of season 2, meaning Slovak was still appearing after Mr. Simmons stepped in.
</li><li> Copyright dates indicate season 5 had most of its episodes completed in 2000, and the final two episodes "April Fool's Day" and "The Journal" (an hour-long special) in 2001. Eight aired in Spring 2000 (not counting the aforementioned "Parents Day"), three in January 2001, five plus "The Journal" in 2002, three in 2003, and the final episode was not aired until June 2004.

They later changed their mind and it aired in the middle of season 26. (A similar occurrence happened during production of "Kamp Krusty".)

The full series was completed and a trailer was released in 2013, around when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> was finishing its run. Unfortunately, that was about the same time Disney bought Lucasfilm. Reportedly, Disney didn't want younger audiences to be introduced to classic Star Wars characters via goofy parodies before seeing them in the new film trilogy. The series was postponed, though the showrunners of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> say the series will be released at some point (and Lucasfilm has at least renewed the trademark as of June 2018).

This delay left fans confused and annoyed, and not even creator Joe Murray knew when the special would be released, considering that the change of executives Nickelodeon underwent that year (with Brian Robbins stepping in as CEO) and the dismal ratings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">Hey Arnold!

IMDb claims that the special aired on April 3, 2019 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">Uruguay</a>, but there was no other evidence to back this up. On May 10th, 2019, Viacom announced that the broadcast rights to both <em>Static Cling</em> and <em>Enter The Florpus</em> have been sold to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> as part of Nickelodeon's attempt to focus more on digital platforms.

It was given a quiet release on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> before airing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWB">The WB</a> once one of the network's executives encountered a party guest who had seen the short and loved it.

</li><li> <em>It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown</em> was finished in 1992 and was set to premiere on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> during the late spring season, but the network ended up canceling the potential airing for unspecified reasons. This marked the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> special not to air in prime-time. Subsequently, Paramount released the special on VHS in 1996 (on a double feature with <em>Charlie Brown's All-Stars</em>) and it finally made its TV debut in 1998 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>.
