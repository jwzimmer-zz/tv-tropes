</p><p>Cryonics, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, is a mechanism by which a person can be frozen, halting the aging process and giving them a non-stop ticket on the Suspended Animation Express to the future. Once they <em>get</em> to the future, they can be thawed out and reanimated.
</p><p>The result is that we get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Fish out of Temporal Water</a> setup wherein a human &#151; usually the audience's approximate contemporary &#151; is thrust into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a> and has to adjust to their new environment.

</p><p>It also works with the past, as many works have played with the idea of turning a prehistoric caveman or a viking loose in modern society. In this case, of course, the freezing has to be by natural means which stretches the credibility of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing">Harmless Freezing</a> even further. (This is more the realm of cartoons and soft science fiction that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">get away with it</a> more easily)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Cryonics, the study of preserving humans or other organisms at low temperature, is frequently confused with cryogenics, the creation of very low temperatures and the study of how materials behave under those conditions. Honestly, just because a word has "-gen-" in it doesn't mean it has anything to do with biology.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryonicsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryonicsFailure">Cryonics Failure</a>, where something goes horribly wrong that kills some or all sleepers, is a potential danger.
</p><p><strong>The Human Popsicle usually takes one of three forms:</strong>
</p><ul><li> Some mysterious phenomenon unexpectedly freezes our hero until he is found centuries later. Sometimes it's the fault of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Green Rocks</a> or overt magic (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalPrison">both!</a>), other times it's just because they got frozen inside a block of normal ice.
</li><li> Our hero uses a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperShip">Sleeper Ship</a>" &mdash; a (typically) slower-than-light spacecraft which puts the occupants "on ice" (either literally or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa">Convenient Coma</a> that slows aging) to allow them to survive the travel times between stars. The ship gets knocked off course, or encounters a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a>, and isn't found again until far into the future. Alternatively, in the hundreds of years the trip takes, humans manage to invent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTL">faster-than-light travel,</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightspeedLeapfrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightspeedLeapfrog">colonize the destination world long before the sleeper ship arrives. Bonus points if they flat out forget about the sleeper ship. Cue the proud colonists coming out of cryosleep only to find themselves snarled in space traffic.</a> This is a use of cryonics that real scientists are actually interested in, but wouldn't dare take a stab at until all the kinks are worked out.
<ul><li> A variation on the sleeper ship, in more realistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a> settings, is to put the hibernators on a spaceship and accelerate it to close to light-speed, letting Einsteinian physics slow down their personal timeframe with respect to the rest of us. The ship can thus reach faraway planets within <em>the crew's</em> lifetime, though the crew will still experience it as a one-way trip to the future. This and the above are often used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlingALightIntoTheFuture">Fling a Light into the Future</a>.
</li></ul></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Our hero is suffering from a terminal illness and is frozen at or about the moment of death in the hope that future generations will discover a cure for whatever killed/is about to kill them. This is inspired by some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> organisations that offer such services, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience">functionally indistinguishable from the first two kinds</a>, except that you have to be really sick to qualify.
</li></ul><p>The ability to freeze and later revive some simple organisms &mdash; including human embryos &mdash; has existed for some time (one motivation of cryonics is that some animals have an innate ability to survive a similar naturally induced state), but there are many technical problems with applying this to a fully grown human<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08lh9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note08lh9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08lh9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Namely, not all of your organs "freeze" at the same temperature, some react well to freezing while others react poorly, and unfreezing someone is an iffy proposition at best, usually resulting in significant organ damage</span>. And the law does not allow people to be cryonically suspended until they are pronounced clinically dead (or if they aren't legally alive yet, like the aforementioned embryos), which could cause problems if brain damage occurs due to anoxia. For the sake of television, we just assume that whoever does the thawing has the technology to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing">overcome this</a>. Sometimes this problem is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> by claiming that what's actually going on is some sort of localized time stop (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Stands Still</a>, except inside out), although all other aspects of the trope remain the same.
</p><p>In science fiction, cryonics is often either used for something that makes little practical sense or forgotten entirely when it could potentially save the life of a person killed in an accident. An example of the former is using cryonic freezing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryoPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryoPrison">incarcerated criminals</a>. The various rationales that justify it range from relative safety and cheapness compared to feeding, housing, and guarding prisoners on the taxpayers' expense to being an alternative to the death penalty. However, it undermines the punishment aspect of incarceration. Being able to sleep through your long sentence and not have to endure the daily ugly aspects of prison life is not much of a deterrent to criminal behavior. And since one does not age in cryonic prison, life sentences are pointless and the prisoner has served time without having lost a significant portion of his lifespan. He may even outlive his original jailers or former victims. Today, prison sentences of over a hundred years are given only to ensure that the felon will never be eligible for parole in his lifetime. With cryonics, this prisoner will effectively be awakened in an era that he would not have lived to see otherwise. In many stories that heavily rely on the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> characters to amplify drama and suspense, it never occurs to anyone to place these dead minor characters into cryonic suspension so that their lives may be saved later. And this is almost always in future worlds that should have cryonic suspension and the medical knowledge to reverse clinical death in cases of injuries or accidents.
</p><p>If you happen upon someone else who has been frozen, read all the manuals before thawing them out: nine times out of ten, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">they will turn out to be psychopathic murderers</a> (just ask the crew of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>).
</p><p>This is not to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">confused</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors">Ajax's</a> plans to turn someone into a Popsicle, which has less to to do with being frozen, and more to do with having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove">stick shoved through them</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">meat popsicles</a>. Often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>, but the people from this trope rarely experience the time in-between freezing and thawing.

Hitler had him executed, and somewhat casually wondered where he had come from. His aides told him the Allies were nearly there, so he went down into his bunker, where a scientist was finishing work on a stasis chamber. Hitler killed the scientist so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">he would not speak of the project</a> and entered the chamber. Several hundred years later, he awakens with tattered clothes and wild unkempt hair. After making his way through the fortress, he finds a Hitleresque man, and the same scene from the beginning repeats almost exactly.

Nina's resulting amnesia has since been a consistent part of her character, but neither woman is portrayed as ever having any trouble adjusting to having missed the past twenty years.

Of course, Holmes's insistence that the new Moriarty could not have been the same man, reanimated, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">a bit odd</a> in light of the fact that Holmes himself was transported to the world of the future when his own well-preserved corpse, which had been <em>packed in honey</em> (a reference to Holmes's retirement as a beekeeper) after his eventual death, was reanimated and rejuvenated by a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> paradoxically references the trope several times.
<ul><li> In the episode "Radio Bart" Bart uses a walkie-talkie to imitate a child trapped in the bottom of a well. When nobody can offer a solution to rescue the boy, Prof. Frink suggests that the town use cryonics to freeze him so he can be rescued in the future. Poking fun at the trope while combining it with patented <em>Simpsons</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">Bystander Syndrome</a> humor.
</li><li> Jasper Beardley tries to cryonically freeze himself to see the future in the Kwik-E-Mart's freezer section. He woke up after just a couple days, but still <em>thought</em> it was the future when he saw the store was selling Moon Pies. (Well... <em>technically</em> he's right)
</li><li> Another episode took place twenty years in the future, and revealed that Mr. Burns had been frozen by Smithers, and he would only be thawed "the second they discover a cure for... seventeen stab wounds in the back."
<div class="indent"><strong>Smithers:</strong> How are we doing, boys? <br><strong>Professor Frink:</strong> Well, we're up to fifteen!
</div></li><li> Mr. Burns' lost teddy bear also ends up frozen in the Arctic for some 40 years.
</li><li> Another future episode when Homer puts Grampa in a cryonics facility to prevent a disease from killing him. The cure was discovered, but he kept him frozen because it's cheaper than a nursing home and Grampa has constantly been rude to him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>
<ul><li> Parodied in the episode "Prehistoric Ice Man", in which a man is discovered frozen in ice, is successfully thawed... and turns out to be from the unthinkably ancient year of 1996. The episode was first broadcast in 1998. Further parody and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> is invoked when the man returns home... only to find that his wife moved on and found a new husband which she has a biological child with that's 13 years old.
</li><li> Later, in the tenth season episode "Go God Go", Cartman tries to freeze himself in the snow on a mountain top to avoid having to wait the last three weeks for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoWii">a new video game console</a>. An avalanche covers him and he isn't found and unfrozen for 500 years, awakening in a Buck Rogers parody. He is eventually sent back in time, but several weeks before the episode starts, forcing him to have to wait even longer for the video game console.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderMan1967">Spider-Man (1967)</a></em> played with this trope in the episode "Cold Storage", where a pair of crooks incapacitated Spidey by locking him in a freezer. Before being thawed out 24 hours later, Spider-Man dreams of waking up eons later in a desolate future inhabited by men who have reverted to acting like primitive hominids.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode SB-129 has Squidward being locked in the Krusty Krab freezer and not let out for 2000 years; he ended up in a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShinyLookingSpaceships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShinyLookingSpaceships">Shiny Future</a> (literally <em>everything</em> was chrome) filled with SpongeBob clones, and ended up in a fetal position screaming "Future!"

Though we are told that this slowed but did not stop their aging, Lion-O's capsule malfunctioned, and didn't inhibit his aging, making him a child in an adult body.

The Ark and Nemesis crews were knocked into a coma-like stasis lock after both ships crashed... and didn't awaken until the volcano the Autobot ship crashed into erupted and jarred the ship's computer active, <em>four million years later</em>. This is also an example of the trope working in reverse, as the crash happened shortly before Earth's post-dinosaur Ice Age.

<ul><li> NASA are doing serious research to place most of the crew of a Mars mission in what amounts to a medically induced coma for varying periods of time. This also has the advantage that the crew understand what is happening and don&#146;t suffer undue psychological stress from reorientation on revival.
</li><li> Cells Alive System: Experimental technology that uses an oscillatory magnetic field to prevent crystallization of the cell membranes, it however is still being tested.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Frog">common wood frog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has <em>freeze tolerance</em>: it survives freezing temperatures with ice nucleators regulating ice formation as well as massive amounts of glucose as a natural anti-freeze. Though the frog <em>is</em> frozen, the glucose helps prevent "freezer burn" - cellular damage caused by ice - that would essentially kill anything. When warm weather returns, it is dependent on a chemical reaction that should restart its heart, thus recirculating fluids and returning the frog to life.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_salamander">Siberian salamander<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, that can stay frozen for years, and then simply walk it off.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrades">Tardigrades<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, small invertebrates approximately one millimeter in length, can enter a dehydrated state and survive without food or water for over ten years. As for the "frozen" half of being a popsicle, they can be chilled to 1 Kelvin (that is, one degree above absolute zero) for a few minutes and survive. And this doesn't even touch on their other abilities, such as <em>surviving being put in the vacuum of space and directly exposed to the Sun.</em>
</li><li> The well-funded work in cryobiology is mostly in preservation of organs for transplant. Recent successful transplant of frozen pig's liver means that some major breakthrough apparently has been achieved.
</li><li> Related: a number of ocean fish which live in the Antarctic region have a natural antifreeze in their cells. The fish themselves remain conscious (at least, as conscious as normal fish), but the antifreeze they use is both the subject of actual research for coldsleep and a frequent explanation for it in science fiction.
</li><li> Cryonic suspension is a service you can buy <em>right now</em>! The catch: Nobody knows how to freeze and thaw a person without killing them, so you have to be clinically dead before it can be done to you. And it's somewhat expensive; it'll cost you or your life insurance company tens of thousands of dollars. On the plus side, the technology, and indeed science, to revive you might exist someday. Is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">Only Mostly Dead</a> instead of dead for good worth it? Your call.
</li><li> Minus the coming-back-to-life part, nature has created some very well-preserved mummies of early humans and hominids this way. Not the least of which is &Ouml;tzi the Iceman, who was frozen in the Alps over five thousand years ago. There are also the Children of Llullaillaco, Inca human sacrifices preserved high in the Andes.
</li><li> The Alpine Weta from New Zealand anybody? (Where do you think Weta Digital got their name?) freezes into a block of ice, comes the spring...
</li><li> This happened to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/03/us/dakota-teen-ager-recovers-after-being-frozen-stiff.html">Jean Hilliard<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of North Dakota. She was frozen stiff, but was as good as new when she thawed out.
</li><li> A famously bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> states that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> was frozen and placed under the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Besides Pirates of the Caribbean, it can be the castle and Matterhorn which are popular locations people claim he's in. He was actually cremated (which, if you think about it, is the <em>opposite</em> of this trope).
</li><li> Baseball legend Ted Williams' body was preserved with cryonics at the insistence of his family (and against his own wishes to be cremated), in the hope that advancements in medical science can one day enable them all to be reunited. Mr. Williams' head was also frozen separately from his body, meaning medical science now has <em>twice</em> as much work to do if a Williams family reunion is ever going to happen.
</li><li> While you can't exactly go on forever, if you do happen to find yourself drowning in ice cold water, the temperature allows your brain to be deprived of oxygen longer. There have been cases of victims being underwater for almost a half hour and revived. There's a saying to this effect, namely that nobody is dead until they're warm and dead.
<ul><li> Similarly there's been multiple cases of people who've been found outside when the temperature is well below zero and were seemingly dead; cold, stiff, blue, not breathing, no detectable pulse, etc, but "came back to life" after being warmed up and resuscitated.

Thankfully, it only infects amoebae.
</li><li> In documentary "The Natural History of the Chicken", a rural Maine woman recalls having one of her yard chickens caught in bad weather and frozen solid. She brought it in, waiting for it to thaw so she could fit it into a shoebox to bury, and found it coming back to life.
</li><li> Various woody plants from cold environments <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609829/">can survive being frozen<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
