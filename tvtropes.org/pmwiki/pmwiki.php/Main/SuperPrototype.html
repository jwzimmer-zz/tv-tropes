A super prototype will have better weapons, stronger armor, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">higher-quality speakers</a> than the units rolling off the assembly line. Even when there aren't very many of whatever device was designed in the first place, the prototype model is almost always the most powerful or has at least some advantage over the other models.
</p><p>A question that often comes up is why the super prototype is so, well, super compared to the production model. The typical reason given is that the production model is far cheaper or easier to make in large numbers. Except that this defeats the whole purpose of a <em>prototype</em> - something built to test the feasibility and capabilities of a final product and correct any flaws before mass production begins, meaning ideally you want your test unit to be as similar to your production unit as possible. As such, real-life prototypes are frequently highly similar to if not indistinguishable from standard models. Mostly, this is just a case of letting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessValue">that much more awesome than everyone else</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Writers tend to find various reasons for why the Prototype is better which usually fall under a few general lines of reasoning.
</p><p></p><ol start="START_NUMBER"><li> A real-world concept that more closely resembles the super prototype is the <em>experimental</em> unit or "concept car," which is intended to test out new technology and its limits without ever being meant for mass production at all. As cost-effectiveness is less important, experimental units frequently <em>do</em> have superior performance to eventual mass production models. Military test pilots refer to this as "pushing the envelope" - the upper edge is height, the right-hand edge is speed. Visualize this as the kind of envelope you mail somebody and you realize that particular area is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">where the postage gets canceled</a>. In this instance, a common flaw for the Hero to have is that because the prototype is meant for performance but not longevity, there are no proper safeguards in place to protect the user or others nearby. This can lead to a power overload or damage to the prototype and/or the hero, effectively giving them a whole load of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Techniques</a>, in addition to the experimental technology itself.</li><li>A common fusion of the normally opposite tropes, Super Prototype and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a>, is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s version is more powerful but has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap">Drama-Preserving Handicap</a> that the others don't." Maybe all versions after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s are weaker because the "use it for longer than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">five minutes</a> and it shuts down/explodes/drives you insane" problem could not be fixed without losing some power. It would, of course, be equally workable for the hero to be less powerful but lack the handicap, but that's less popular.</li><li>An alternate version that often combines aspects of the 1st and 2nd variety introduces a prototype not of the current rank-and-file model, but their intended successor. This justifies its superiority as being an upgrade over the current standard, while still being experimental justifies any flaws in untested systems.</li><li>Another common version is when the prototype is made by a genius and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">only they fully understand the technology behind it</a>. Then the genius dies and the prototype goes missing. The bad guys may have the notes and schematics, but there's only so much that they can figure out without the prototype itself. As a result, only weaker or imperfect versions of the prototype can be made. This gives the bad guys a strong motivation to retrieve the prototype, since studying it could allow them to produce perfect replicas. The hero must then keep it out of their hands at all costs. This is often used for more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">inexperienced heroes</a> as it justifies the enemy not using all their resources against the heroes for fear of damaging the prototype.</li><li>Most prosaically, a project may simply have run into budget difficulties or been sidelined in favour of something else, resulting in significant cutbacks to the quality of the end product.</li><li>Lastly, the prototype may not be a prototype but instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a> technology or if a prototype was made, black box technology was incorporated into the design and the "super" parts of the prototype are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">unreplicable.</a> </li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A closely related trope is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a>.

Technically. Since most prototypes have more than one attribute, overlap can occur where it has both flaws and superiorities. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumRebel">Phlebotinum Rebel</a> usually is both, with superior abilities but inferior obedience, so it does not carry out the purposes it was made for.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> metaseries makes extensive use of this trope. Pretty much any mecha with "Gundam" in its name will be either this, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a>, or both. This is justified in-universe due to cost-effectiveness; the prototype usually carries a better reactor, armor, and weapons. Mass produced units based on these super prototypes tend to sport cheaper and inferior features (or the features are removed from the mass production unit altogether) so they can produce a lot more with same amount of budget and resources. The prototypes are also usually very goal-oriented, with each one being designed to test some new weapon, technology, or design technique. Additionally, most of the super prototypes remain superior only to their generation of Mobile Suits as technological race is a strong theme in the Gundam series; few suits that can hold their own against even the bog-standard suits of later generations. As a whole, the super protoype mobile suits are one-offs that spawn cheaper copies and are later discarded or destroyed. There are a few exceptions to this:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, while the RX-78-2 Gundam was intended to be a quantum leap over Zeon's Zaku II (hence its Super Prototype status), it was also experimental in that the Earth Federation was still learning how to make a mobile suit at all. Some of the features were intended less for combat utility than to ensure that the testing data would be preserved (a "Learning Computer" that not only recorded even the most minute details of its performance but also analyzed the data in real-time, and an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod">Escape Pod</a> that transformed into a functional jet fighter to maximize the odds of survival for the Learning Computer in the event of a disaster), and other elements simply couldn't be produced cheaply enough to justify inclusion in the mass-production RGM-79 GM. Thus, the GM lacked any escape pod at all, used ordinary titanium armor instead of the exotic "luna titanium" alloy that at the time could only be produced in a single laboratory, and carried a "beam spray gun" pistol that was equal in lethality to the Gundam's beam rifle but shorter-ranged and less accurate. And by the time the One Year War ended, Zeon's latest mass-production mobile suit, the Gelgoog, actually exceeded the Gundam's performance in all aspects except armor; at this point it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Amuro Ray's own skills</a> rather than the power of the Gundam that made him nearly unstoppable in battle, and the Gundam had to be upgraded with magnetic coating on its joints to compensate for <em>him</em>.
<ul><li> The Guncannon and Guntank are also this, as later in the war a limited number of mass production versions were produced with weaker weapons and lacking the core block system.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">twists it</a>. While the eponymous Victory Gundam is superior to its simplified sister model <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Gun EZ</a>, the actual mass production model is identical to the prototype. The Victory 2 was meant to be a limited-production model, but the other suits were destroyed prior to being fielded, leaving Uso's V2 as a unique unit.
<ul><li> On the whole, <em>Victory</em> shows a more realistic deployment: In the beginning, the V-Gundam takes the Superiority Fighter role while the Gun EZ takes the workhorse role. Then, the V-Gundam is mass-produced as the V-Gundam Hexa and takes the workhorse role, with the V-Dash Gundam filling in the Superiority Fighter role until the V2 is ready, at which point the V-Dash takes on a Joint Support role, covering both the V-Hexa workhorses and the V2. The Gun EZ and Jamesgun are relegated to the gunship role held by the Ball in the One Year War.
</li></ul></li><li> While it appears to be played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, with the Strike Dagger being inferior to the Strike Gundam, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">sidestories</a> reveal that Strike Dagger is merely a stopgap production; the actual mass production model, the 105 Dagger, is superior to the Strike Gundam. Sure, it has limited laminate armor instead of full body PS armor, but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere">pretty much every mobile suit using beam weaponry by that point</a>, the latter isn't as useful as it was.
<ul><li> The Astray line is an odd case. The colored Frames (Red, Blue, Gold, Green and Mirage) were all prototypes, but weren't anything incredible. It's only by the wonders of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">their respective pilots customizing them</a> that they became superior to the later mass produced M1 Astray units. And even then, the mass-produced Astrays could take on the prototypes, as the Red Frame was once easily taken down by a simple M1 Astray (granted one piloted by a Coordinator).
</li><li> However, <em>Gundam SEED</em> does play the trope straight with the Moebius mobile armor. The Moebius Zero prototype sports four detachable and independently maneuverable gun barrels in a precursor to the DRAGOON system later used to great effect by certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick">Bigger Stick</a> mecha like the Providence; the production model Moebius lacks these, using only the forward-fixed central cannon. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in that only a select few OMNI pilots had the spatial awareness and piloting skills required to use the detachable gun barrels effectively, and of those pilots very few (we basically know of Mu la Flaga only) survived the Battle of Endymion prior to the start of the anime, so paring down the design was an unfortunate necessity.
</li><li> The GuAIZ Experimental Firearms Type mounted the same weaponry as both the Freedom and the Justice, but was scaled back to the basics for the production model because it was incredibly expensive to maintain. The production models were massively scaled back because, at the time, it was near the closing moments of the war and the standard weaponry was deemed good enough (and it was, as the GuAIZ was one of the most powerful production mobile suits to be used during the war). Unfortunately both suffered a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a> when the new ZAKU Warriors proved to be superior and cheaper. Especially compared to the GuAIZ-R version that was introduced as a stopgap before the ZAKU Warrior, with scaled-down weapons and performance both to cut costs and because the "Extensional Arrestor" weapons (a combined rocket anchor, beam dagger and beam gun) that was so devastating in combat at the Battle of GENESIS proved impossible for all but the most elite pilots to control.
</li><li> The ZAKU Warrior is another inversion as its prototype, the ZAKU Trial Type, had no beam weaponry despite having an N-Jammer Canceller-outfitted nuclear engine. The ZAKU Trial Type was intended for mass production, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeaceConference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeaceConference">Treaty of Junius</a> banned the military use of N-Jammer Cancellers and thus the design was reworked. The addition of superior weapons is probably explained by the extra couple of years of development.
</li><li> The Extended 'Biological CPU' introduced in Gundam SEED is superior to the Extended introduced later in Gundam SEED Destiny, as they were able to pressure even high-end Coordinators like Kira and Athrun in combat.

Instead, the Virsago and Ashtaron essentially split the Belphagor's gimmicks in half and develop them in their own direction.
</li></ul></li><li> It's also noteworthy that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> this trope becomes the shtick of Paptimus Scirocco. Over the course of the series he cranks out one-shot, scratch-built mobile suits at an astonishing rate. The Messala, Pallas Athena, Bolinoak Samaan and The-O are all unique Scirocco designs, while the Gabthley and Hambrabi are limited production models designed by Scirocco for the Federation's use and only 2-4 of each were ever made. In general, Scirocco's godlike ability to crank out butt-kicking mobile suits is used as a catch-all explanation for all Titans suits that aren't the Psyco Gundam.
<ul><li> And the Gundam Mk-II actually inverts this - even though it was a Super Prototype for the next generation of MS and, for awhile, could one-up the Titans' Hi-Zack units(current generation), there was nothing special about it outside of its special lighter frame system and it's easily outclassed early on. All it really is is an updated copy of the original RX-78 Gundam made using modern technologies, and thus ceased to be anything special when those same new technologies were incorporated into the new generation of mass-produced mobile suits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em> has a similar inversion with the Gundam GP01 "Zephyrantes", which was little more than an update to the original Gundam with new tech, it comes with the ground type and space type configuration, which is more powerful than the mass production model of the time at its specialized area but weaker when placed in the other, so it is just an exchange of spec instead of "Super" in all aspects. In fact, the proposed Gundam GP04 "Gerbera" was scrapped for being little more than a copy of the GP01; it was later reworked into a more Zeon-esque design, the Gerbera Tetra, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides">sold to the Zeon remnants</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the U.C. super prototypes are depicted as being advanced for their era but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">with crippling flaws</a> that are usually the result of being developed to field test a particular technology with little consideration to anything else:
<ul><li> The MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki from the aforementioned <em>Zeta Gundam</em> was designed to test out beam-resistant armor and the concept of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Moveable Frame</a>. The beam-resistant armor worked. The transformation feature did not. But the moveable wing binders left on the unit did improve the mobility of it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">MSN-010 Double Zeta</a> is a massive power-house that can transform into a mobile armor, has two of the biggest beam sabers in all of Gundam, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">high mega cannon</a> is powerful enough to turn any opposing Mobile Suits into little more than drops of melted steel. Unfortunately the high mega cannon drains almost all of its power supply <em>in one shot</em>, and its over-complicated transforming frame makes it structurally weak, turning it into something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">RX-0 Unicorn Gundam</a> has psychoframes built into its entire structure. When these activate, it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">unstoppable killing machine</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">amazing speed</a> that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HackYourEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HackYourEnemy">hijack enemy-controlled psychoframes</a>&mdash;for five minutes. Until the psychoframes go active, it's just a slightly-above-average MS with two beam sabers and one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">beam magnum</a> (with only 15 shots).
</li></ul></li><li> The Tallgeese in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Gundam Wing</a></em> was the precursor to all mobile suits in that universe. It's so powerful it can hold its own against the first generation of Gundams in that series. It did have one glaring design flaw: it was so powerful that it <em>killed its own pilots</em>. This was because the Tallgeese effectively had no shock absorbers; its gargantuan size and incredible thrusters transferred <em>all of the G-Force</em> to the pilot. The Leos that were based on its design are far weaker but also safer for people to pilot.
</li><li> The Wing Zero is, likewise, a super prototype to the Gundams, as it housed the dangerous ZERO System, which fed real-time tactical data directly into the minds of its pilot. Unfortunately unless you actually <em>know</em> how to process that data, it just drives you insane. The comparatively downsized Gundams each just settled for unique weapons tacked on to the general frame. Note that the Wing Zero was specifically designed to counter the Tallgeese. The reason why it is considered 'super' compared to its following generation model Gundams aside from the ZERO System is that it was designed with the expertise of all five Gundam scientists, who at some point afterward parted ways and recreated their own respective Gundam creations with their own styles and preferences, but without input from the others involved in the original creation, none quite as powerful or versatile.
<ul><li> There's also some speculation that the Wing Zero may have <em><strong>EATEN</strong></em> one of the pilots who attempted to use it. Because despite the pilot being declared dead and the cockpit never opening after his death until Zechs captured it, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a> afterwards, which not only means the suit is dangerous to the mind of the pilots, it may have actually gotten a taste for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaHumanitarian">human flesh</a>. The fact that Heero <em>talks</em> to Zero like it can actually communicate with him, and tells Zechs that both Zero and Epyon have "told" him things just makes the ZERO system itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> on several levels.
</li></ul></li><li> The Vayeate and Mercurius from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Gundam Wing</a></em> was this to the mass production Virgos. However this was due to both of the mobile suits being test beds for their respective systems; the Vayeate needed an external reactor to power its beam cannon while the Mercurius had to dedicate all of its power to the "Planet Defensors", leaving it with very little offensive capability beyond a beam saber-shield. The Virgo was designed to be something in-between; housing less than a quarter of the Mercurius' Planet Defensors so that it can wield a less powerful version of the Vayeate's Beam Cannon. This was acceptable, as the Virgo was to be mass produced and unmanned, so what they lacked in quality they made up for in overwhelming quantity. In fact when the two prototype suits were later rebuilt as unmanned Mobile Dolls as well, they fared much less effectively against the Gundams, as they were only marginally more effective, but there was only two of them compared to the dozens of Virgos flying around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">The 08th MS Team</a></em> actually averts this. The series is known for, instead of making a traditional <em>Gundam</em> series about a boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Falling into the Cockpit</a> and getting involved in the current war, focusing on the everyday soldiers in the One Year War. Because of this, most pilots in the series don't have brand-new prototype Mobile Suits. Instead they have things like the RX-79(G) Gundam Ground Type, which is merely spare parts from the RX-78 Gundam program made into a mass-produced Gundam designed for ground combat. There's also the Gundam Ez8, which is an RX-79(G) rebuilt with field-fabricated parts due to lack of spares. One poor unit even had its destroyed head replaced with that of a GM. Still, the Ground Type Gundam's run was limited to about 20 units, with its GM counterpart, the RGM-79(G), only having 42 base units and a handful of Sniper variants built. That said, according to side materials the ground-type GM does have some Super Prototype-esque features over the standard GM - for one, it's still made out of the rarer and more durable luna titanium the original Gundam uses, rather than the standard GM's lighter but weaker titanium alloy. It's also compatible with a wider variety of weapons, including a full-sized, full-power beam rifle rather than the smaller and weaker "beam spray gun" the standard GM uses... though beam rifles were in such short supply that most examples of both the Gundam and GM Ground Type carried less powerful projectile-firing machine guns instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamF91">Mobile Suit Gundam F91</a></em>'s eponymous Mobile Suit (the Formula 91) plays with this; its prequel manga features the F91's predecessor (the <a class="urllink" href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/F90_Gundam_F90">Formula 90<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), of which two were made. The F90s sported multiple hardpoints all over their chassis which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">could be outfitted with different equipment</a>, resulting in eight specialized configurations (later model line and settings expanded the equipment up to 26 different packs). S.N.R.I. (the company responsible for the Formula Project) then used the combat data from each configuration and built the F91 using optimized versions of the most effective and well-rounded F90 variant (namely the <a class="urllink" href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/F90V_Gundam_F90_VSBR_Type">F90V<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). The F91 was later subject to limited mass production, though no changes were made to the mass produced units from the original F91. So in essence the F91 is only a super prototype in regards to the previous Formula Gundam, with its mass-produced equivalents being almost carbon copies, with the exception of the locked overdrive mode of its Bio-computer which over-heats the unit (but gives it a short performance boost) and fixed the paint shredding flaw (which gave the prototype a strange ability of splitting into multiple images on the enemy screen).
</li><li> On the Zeon side, the line between Super Prototype and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> is heavily blurred, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">Zeon's MS design companies are all competing with each other in midwar</a> to build the next generation of <em>wunderwaffen</em>, and very few prototypes actually pan out (such as M'Quve's Gyan, which was one out of a production run of three suits, and looked over because it relied too heavily on support from an existing design). However, Char Aznable's MS-14S Gelgoog, the prototype for the Gelgoog line, was faster (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">though less well-armored</a>) than the mass-produced MS-14A model. This also ended up costing several pilots at the end of the war, since even the base Gelgoog was built to specifications suggested by Zeon's aces - which meant that when someone who wasn't as skilled as them got their hands on one, they couldn't make it work as well as it could, and many were lost to the Gundam and other Federation mobile suits despite outperforming them from a technological standpoint.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> is very much this case, particularly with the Gundams of Celestial Being, and the more specialized units of the Earth Sphere Federation's A-Laws, and Innovade allies. Each of the main Gundams have a specific role, such as Sniper, Melee, Aerial Assault, or Heavy Artillery <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which secretly hides its real purpose, as a judge, jury, and executioner for those who betray Celestial Being's ideals with a system that shuts down a rogue Gundam's systems</span>.

After 200 years of working in secret before publicly announcing their presence to the world, Celestial Being manged to produce a total of 5 GN Drives, and is indeed, considered more valuable than the Gundams themselves. It takes two years for Celestial Being, after the events of the anime and leading to the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gundam00AWakeningOfTheTrailblazer">Gundam 00: A Wakening of the Trailblazer</a></em>, to make two brand new GN Drives specially designed for the new 00 Qan[T], and it's remarked upon by several characters that this was considered to be <em>fast</em>. It takes another 50 years, according at the end of the movie, for Earth as a whole to be able to start mass producing True GN Drives, and not the GN Tau Drives they've been using.

Swallow Graze) is a prototype of the mass produced Graze, however, being experimental weapon, they're modified to have multiple boosters to amplify its aerial combat, equipped with wire claw, as well as a rifle lance. There's a reason the Schwalbe Graze piloted by a select few elite Gjallarhorn pilots is called the EB-05s (as opposed to the standard EB-06 Graze) - according to the translated manual, it's one of several prototypes for the production model that was rejected for being too tricky to handle for regular pilots. Gjallarhorn went with a different design for the regular Graze, but built a few more Schwalbes for those elite pilots capable of drawing out its impressive performance without getting themselves killed. It earns its reputation as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> for high rank officers.
</li><li> The V08-1228 Grimgerde is one of the nine Valkyrie Mobile Suits developed by Gjallarhorn in Pre-Calamity War, Grimgerde serves as the prototype of the mass produced Graze as well as the Graze Swords carried by Carta Issue.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> usually averts this, with the production models being built up from the prototype's capabilities. Even prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em> only uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> in the form of the VF-0 Phoenix: despite having flight performance head-and-shoulders above conventional jet aircraft and even limited capability for <em>underwater operation</em>, it's a maintenance-hog and the war's outbreak meant that the engineers couldn't wait until the intended space-capable reactor engines were completed so they simply slapped on the strongest air-breathing jet engine they could get their hands on and crossed their fingers.
<ul><li> The majority of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus">Macross Plus</a></em> consists of a contest between two super prototypes (YF-19 and YF-21) competing to be the new mass production model; they eventually choose the YF-19 after the YF-21's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualUserInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualUserInterface">Unusual User Interface</a> proves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">a little unsafe if the pilot gets distracted during flight</a>; the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destruction of the YF-21 prototype</span> doesn't help either. This is actually a realistic portrayal of the prototyping system; similar contests have actually occurred in real life.
</li><li> The portrayal of the mass-produced models of the YF-19 and -21 is also somewhat realistic, as both prototypes performed <em>too well</em>, to the point that they could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">only be piloted by the best</a>. Their mass-production models only saw limited use, and even the older VF-17 saw longer service.

It proved to be a fearsome opponent in melee combat against other labors and when it was overtaken by the Babel virus, it completely mopped the floor with Ohta's Ingram and Noa barely managed to subdue it. Seeing as the Type Zero wasn't seen in the subsequent films, it can be assumed that the design was abandoned.

The titular mecha (<em>referred to as such</em> by the regularly no-fourth-wall characters) is both a production model&mdash;the protagonists get <em>two</em> of them, unheard of in a mecha show up to that point. The Xabungles are also a prototype in the sense that no prior Walker Machine is built specifically for combat (hence the series name&mdash;Combat Mecha) and they incorporate a number of features that imply they're space-capable. The Walker Gallier in the second half of the show is a textbook example (and even has a production model of sorts in the Brackary). It's famously "Super" enough to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn">catch and throw</a></em> a falling ICBM (albeit a museum copy, but still).

Because Sara saved them in it, it's explained away as a "prototype" to anyone that asks. Her brother's Gloire, on the other hand, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a>.
</li><li> Remarked upon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>, in reference to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Grappals/Gulaparls</a> compared to the Gurren Lagann:
<div class="indent"><strong>Gimi:</strong> Anyway, aren't Grappals supposed to be superior to Gurren Lagann? There's something wrong with a prototype being stronger.
</div><ul><li> The trick here wasn't intentionally dumbing down the mass-produced version but rather the designers being ignorant of one crucial fact: the Gurren Lagann, like all Ganmen, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a>. Simply copying the machinery won't help if they don't know what makes it tick. Once this fact is discovered, they quick-fix the situation with the addition of Spiral weaponry but they're still nowhere near enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Ganmen territory</a>.
</li><li> As seen in the movies, if your will is high enough, even the mass production models can grow into galaxy sized bots, a la "Tengen Toppa Grappal/Gulaparl" and fire planet system-sized shotgun rounds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> features several super prototypes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">progressing in power with the times.</a> Supplementary materials explain the backstory of KMF development, where they were literally putting pieces together just to see how it worked.
<ul><li> The best subversion of this trope is the Ganymede, the earliest-built Knightmare to be shown in the series (3rd Generation). It has no internal power source, only batteries; no weapons, no closed cockpit and insufficient motive power to do anything other than harmlessly cruising. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">It can make the world's biggest pizza, though.</a>
<ul><li> This is actually a Double Subversion. The Ganymede model was indeed the Super Prototype of its day, being a powerful mecha in the right hands. These hands being those of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilkHidingSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilkHidingSteel">Marianne vi Britannia,</a> nicknamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">"the Flash"</a> for her incredible skill with the Ganymede, rivalling the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Knight of One,</a> Bismarck Waldstein <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who used his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Geass</a> to cheat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">and STILL lost to Marianne.</a></span> After Marianne's death, the Ganymede, being her signature Knightmare, fell out of favour and was decommissioned, having its weaponry removed and returned to the manufacturers, the Ashford Academy.
</li></ul></li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">subversion</a> is the Gawain; when Lelouch jacked it, it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> KMF. It could fly, but a flaw in the hadron cannons left the beam unfocused, causing it to spew energy in a wide arc which could just as easily hit friend as well as foe. That problem was fixed, making the beams extremely deadly, but it was still outmatched in close combat. Its mass-production version, the Gareth, had the cannons moved it its hands.
</li><li> To a smaller extent, the Vincent: the Vincent Ward final version scraps the needle blazer weapon to ease production. Also Vincent's own Super Prototype, the Lancelot: the world's first seventh-generation KMF, later upgraded into the one-of-a-kind ninth-generation unholy terror known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Lancelot Albion</a>.
</li><li> On the opposite side of the coin, Guren Nishiki gets two successors: the limited-production Gekka and the mass-production Akatsuki (as well as Tohdoh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Zangetsu</a>). Neither can hold a candle to the original, especially after it receives its own ninth-gen upgrade into the Guren SEITEN.
<ul><li> That said, this may be due to the pilot, but no direct comparison is made between the Guren's abilities and any of it's MP derivatives. Also, the Prototype Radiation Arm used by the Guren Nishiki after it's original Radiation Arm is destroyed seems to be both weaker, and not as well built, but this is also difficult to compare.
</li><li> The Gekka at the very least are roughly on par with the original Guren in terms of specs and build. They simply lack the Radiation Wave technology that made it so dangerous and have to rely on their swords, but still can run rings around the standard Sutherland and even keep up with the Lancelot. The Akatsuki are harder to judge because by the time they're released Britannia has revamped their military to have a new generation of mass produced units as well as more single custom knightmares like the Knights of the Round's units.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Appears as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>, the archetypal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">Super Robot</a> series. Mazinger Z was lacking a lot of its special features at first and regularly had to be upgraded and re-outfitted with new equipment. At the same time, the manga introduced the Mazinger Army, a trio of weaker robots each designed to wield one of Mazinger's distinctive weapons. All three made minor appearances in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em> movie, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all three were destroyed, with only Million Alpha putting up any kind of a fight</span>.
<ul><li> Averted in, of all things, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> &mdash; the Mikene Empire get a hold of Great's plans and mass produce it perfectly (with the exception of its wings). They usually show up in any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> installment when the <em>Great Mazinger</em> storyline is used.
</li><li> And it was also averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em>: Shin Great Mazinger and Mazinkaiser are explicitly stated to be the finished models, their predecessors are the prototypes.
</li><li> And averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger">Shin Mazinger</a></em> as Energer-Z was able to go toe to toe with Mazinger-Z.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> does strange things with this trope. Units 00, 01, and 02 are referred to as the prototype unit, test unit, and production unit, respectively, but they're functionally identical in operation. <em>End of Evangelion</em>'s Mass Production Evas are a little ambiguous, but have very little resemblance to any of the prior Units in terms of how they work and operate.
<ul><li> If anything, Unit-00 is considered less reliable than its counterparts. As a prototype, Unit-00 wasn't intended for actual field deployment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And, Rei 1's soul is rather unstable and rebellious.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> gives us Provisional Unit-05 which is very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a>, as it was rushed into service half-built to deal with an emergency situation. The only advantage it had over any other Evas were the flight thrusters. The third <em>Rebuild</em> movie subverts the trope by introducing even later Eva Units that are far superior to the prototypes they'd been using: with modular weapons packs that can quickly be swapped out mid-battle, portable batteries allowing them to operate without the umbilical cable, and the Eva Mark-09 has rocket boosters that allow it to fly under its own power and an Angel-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unit-13 appears to be Unit-01's successor and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Attack Drones</a> and two sets of arms, in addition to Unit-01's ability to initiate an Impact Event under the right circumstances.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls">Sky Girls</a></em> features this: The three original Sonic Divers are prototypes, and they do their job well. Subverted in the fact that the mass production model can do just as well, but the WORM attacks the production assembly plant, making the only one model that was completed a super prototype in its own way.
<ul><li> Also used straight when the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Vic Vipers</a></span> make their debut, it is marketed as cheap, much better and more heavily-armed alternative to the Sonic Divers that the titular characters use, and hence, is mass-produced. Not only it really is underperforming in comparison, the best thing it can do is act as support rather than replacement. It actually even gets beaten by an old, conventional fighter piloted by the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> in the end, and <em>it's a two-against-one battle</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MetalArmorDragonar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MetalArmorDragonar">Metal Armor Dragonar</a></em> plays with this a bit. The beginning of the series shows the Dragonars as a set of stolen super prototype units, but their pilots are inexperienced, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> units trounce them frequently. After a while, the Dragonars are used as the template for a new Mass Production model that has specs stronger than any of the Dragonar units. However, after Professor Plato guides the heroes back to the military, the Dragonars are upgraded into Ace Custom Super Prototypes.
</li><li> Pretty much the only mechs that accomplish anything important in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em> are super prototypes, with the two Nirvash (which are actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">alive</a></em>) units being the most prominent. There's also Holland's late-series mount, the TB-303 Devilfish, which is ridiculously powerful and has enough firepower to wipe out multiple capital ships, but requires the pilot to take life-threatening drugs to operate it... Aside from those, the rest of the powerful LFO's are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Customs</a>. Anything with "KLF" or "Mon-Soono" in its name is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">utter cannon fodder</a>.
</li><li> Sagara Sousuke of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> handles the <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/Kuruni/MS-Story/Vault-Other/arx-7.jpg">ARX-7 Arbalest<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, one of the first mecha to be fielded by MITHRIL to possess a Lambda Driver. Later in the series he goes up against many enemy mecha with Lambda Drivers of their own, but proves his to be the more powerful while defeating them in combat. It is suggested that this is because the Lambda Driver in Sousuke's mecha is a prototype model compared to the mass-produced variants fielded by the enemy, and is capable of increased output at the cost of stability. It does, indeed, fail to function properly on a number of occasions, leading Sousuke to become thoroughly frustrated with it. Said Lambda Driver is later put into the ARX-8 Laevatein which, despite the serial number, is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> put together in a hurry. It can still kick the asses of everything mass-produced, though.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VipersCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VipersCreed">Viper's Creed</a></em>: in the last episode we see a prototype white mech with greater speed, armor and two additional arms; but its software is not optimized, so at critical moments it freezes from bugs.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>. The XGP15A-II was purpose built using advanced military tech for the purpose of reaching the Galactic Leyline.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Chachamaru</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, the first of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Hakase, Chao, and the engineering club's</a> line of androids, which Chachamaru refers to as her little brothers and sisters. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseGirl">Ku Fei</a> mentioned before she kicked the asses of multiple mass-production versions of Chachamaru at once, as long as it's not Chachamaru herself, the fight is easy.
</li><li> Clamp managed to do this in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelicLayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelicLayer">Angelic Layer</a></em> to the titular toys when the design team unleashed against the tourney players a new prototype model with improved capabilities. Also, the original series can go to "Hypermode" which the later versions can't. Subverted by Shuko using a prototype that can barely move to beat the later version doll Wizard around like a, well, ragdoll even with vastly inferior tech and movements simply because she's that good.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter Robo</a> &#256;&#7717;</em> has mass-produced Getters who are nowhere near the godly power of Shin, who was too terrifyingly destructive to replicate. There's also the fact that limiting the amount of Getter Rays the machines can hold prevents them from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turning sentient</span>. In <em>Getter Robo Armageddon</em>, Professor Saotome mass produces Getter Robo G in massive numbers with the sole purpose of forming them into Shin Dragon. Ryouma doesn't care and still beats the machines to a pulp.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Hyper-Zoanoids</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> are, like ordinary Zoanoids, genetically-altered humans. The "hyper" designation is usually applied to prototype genetic templates, which are designed around an individual soldier's DNA; mass-production designs must be simplified to allow them to work on a wider range of humans, so the Hyper models tend to be considerably more powerful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGarFINAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGarFINAL">GaoGaiGar FINAL</a></em> is a zig-zagging example that ultimately plays this straight. GaoGaiGar and GaoFightGar are both based on the blueprints of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Genesic GaoGaiGar</span>, but are significantly weaker; partially due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">humans</span> being unable to perfectly copy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alien</span> design, and partially on purpose, as some of the original's weapons were modified to serve non-offensive purpose. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">supplementary materials</a> explain that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Genesic GaoGaiGar</span> would have actually performed <em>worse</em> against the earlier foes, since it was designed to combat the Sol Masters, while the later GaoGaiGar and GaoFighGar were purpose-built for taking on Zonders and the 31 Primevals. For all intents and purposes, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Genesic GaoGaiGar</span> is a straight upgrade when it's acquired, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the destruction of the Z-Master, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">with it all Zonder metal</a>,</span> has rendered the later models' advantages moot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos">Infinite Stratos</a></em>, it turns out that Ichika's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">IS core</a> is actually the very first one ever made. It's noted that the inventor "poured all [her] heart and soul into that core," since it was her first creation. Note that this is <em>not</em> the reason he can use the IS (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility">he's the only male who can</a>); rather, that is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">never revealed.

<ul><li> Houki's fourth-generation Aka Tsubaki might appear as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> but one cannot forget that it was personally built by the inventor mentioned above and is thus guaranteed to be superior to future fourth-gen designs (for reference, various companies around the world have only begun prototyping and performance testing of <em>third</em>-gen IS units).

Ogre has the same bio-computer system as Al-Zard, but it also caused the deaths of 2 test drivers due to the fact the car was unable to satisfy the talent the bio-computer needed.
</li><li> The Sizzlers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunBuster">GunBuster</a></em> are mass-produced versions of the Gunbuster itself, smaller and weaker (yet powerful enough to fight dozens of alien bugs easily!)

The original Aestivalis were already Super Prototypes when two more appeared, Akatsuki's special Aestivalis (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">with new armor material and engine, befitting the CEO of Nergal</a>) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> X-Aestivalis.

</li><li> An interesting twist on this trope is utilized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet">Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet</a></em>.

However, on Earth, due to their much less advanced technology, Chamber is essentially a this trope. It is so advanced compared to the Earthling's mechs that they can't even make a dent in its hull, even with jackhammers.

</li><li> On the Alliance side we have the <em>Triglav</em> (a new flagship design, superior to the standard <em>Ajax</em>-class and slated for mass production) and the <em>Leda II</em> (a new cruiser design with a curved armour design capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">deflect with little to no damage enemy weapon fire</a>, at least at distance.

<ul><li> This happens when any villain tries to replicate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a>. The first villain to try it is bigger, stronger &amp; faster than the original, but the original never pushes it to the limits because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">idiocy-inducing effects of an overdose</a>, or the subject becoming completely musclebound or even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">exploding</a></em>. On the rare occasions that the villains continue to use the super serum on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, they will have much smaller doses and usually be sent in groups.
</li><li> Related to the above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> is the super prototype for the Super Soldier program. Others are constantly trying to replicate his success with results ranging from severe mental deterioration (Isaiah Bradley from <em>Truth: Red, White and Black</em>, and William Burnside, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">50's Cap</a>) to creating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a>) and the Weapon Plus program (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, aka Weapon X/Ten; Steve Rogers is Weapon I). Captain America's shield is a Super Prototype as well, being the precursor to adamantium. Adamantium is the attempt to recreate the material of his shield, but even primary adamantium is weaker than it.
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> being the super prototype for the Goblin Formula. It was meant to increase intelligence, but also added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, insanity and a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>. Most other Goblin Formula users tend <em>not</em> to get the Healing Factor and double down on the insanity portion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> both subverts this trope and plays it straight. The subversion comes from Stark constantly producing improved models after the original prototype. The straight examples come from any even vaguely mass-produced derivatives, like the Guardsman armors, which are never on par with Iron Man's own gear. Of course, readers probably wouldn't want a bunch of glorified prison guards to be as powerful as the superhero. And, in fact, it's explained that Iron Man himself doesn't want a bunch of glorified prison guards to be as powerful as he is. He deliberately withholds the best tech for himself and even goes so far as to build in exploitable weaknesses in case the armors are ever used against him. Considering the number of times Stark's technology has been stolen, duplicated or reverse-engineered, he's got a right to be paranoid and hold back technology (although, as seen in the <em>Armor Wars</em> story, sometimes he takes that right too far, beating up innocent people like Stingray and Captain America).
</li><li> In a way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a>. While created by accident, Hulk was the first gamma mutant, and most following gamma beings (the Leader, the Abomination, Madman, Ravage, etc) were based off either recreating that accident or specifically copying his DNA. While some have had greater base-line strength than the Hulk, and most have retained their higher intelligence whereas the Hulk is most often shown to be a savage, Hulk's potential strength (increasing with anger) and his other abilities (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, psychic resistance) have shown him to be the most powerful of the gamma beings. Another factor in the Hulk's Super Prototype-ness is the fact that Bruce Banner's psyche is so damaged, because of abuse he suffered as a kid, that it allows him to do whatever he wishes. Becoming a gamma beast meant unleashing a particular repressed trait. The reason the Hulk is stronger than the others? Because they're not as screwed up as Banner!

And then there's all those replacement Metal Sonics Eggman keeps making, which always get rolled out and blown up within five pages. They've practically become a running gag.

However, Stormfront is nowhere near as powerful as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Customs</a> The Seven in general and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpus">Magnum Opus</a> Homelander in particular - and <em>all</em> of them cost truly ridiculous amounts of money. The protagonists got their enhanced strength and resilience from a Compound V knockoff that cost <em>nineteen billion dollars per shot</em>. When Vogelbaum died, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> that licensed them just plain stopped production, switching to recruiting "naturally occurring" superhumans &mdash; that actually got their powers from their constant experiments with the serum having contaminated the environment, causing random mutations that never really stack up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> nature of the original generation. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vogelbaum didn't really die, but was recruited by the government to make The Boys' serum</span>.
</li><li> It's suggested heavily in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em> that the Emerald Eye of Ekron (best known as the weapon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperheroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperheroes">Legion Of Superheroes</a></em> villain Emerald Empress) was essentially an early version of what would eventually become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> rings. If that's the case, then they clearly broke the mold, as Emerald Empress is consistently shown as able to overpower Green Lanterns and Kryptonians, and has never shown any need to charge the Eye or any trouble with the traditional yellow weakness. On the other hand, it does have a rather unusual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a> (literally; for some reason kryptonite works on it).

He was the first person to make the deal with Galactus and as such Galactus gave him a higher level of Power Cosmic than other succeeding Heralds. Even Heralds that are good friends with Galactus, such as Airwalker, haven't been given close to the amount of power the depowered Surfer got, let alone what he had originally. The only Herald to rival or exceed his power is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">Cosmic Ghost Rider</a>, who's from an alternate future several millennia ahead during a very desperate time for Galactus, carries a number of artifact-level magical weapons (including a chain made from the bones of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Cyttorak</a>), and has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider">Spirit of Vengeance</a> powers as well.

The Advanced Model Paladin Armor's mana requirements are too high for anypony who's not exceptionally powerful (Shining Armor, Gifted Ponies, ect.) or has some magical artifact or ability (the Bearers, Alicorns, ect.) to actually sustain them for extended periods, thus the mass production versions, while much weaker, can be used by anyone while the Advanced versions are reserved for those who can actually use them.

At least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> technical manual says it's one of a Low-Rate Initial Production batch of unsuccessful Super Prototypes; the design was rejected as too expensive and the TIE Interceptor was selected instead.
<ul><li> This was further explained in the Expanded Universe, specifically the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em> game. They had designed a different model similar to Vader's TIE Advanced X1 that was intended for mass production, known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/TIE_Avenger">TIE Avenger,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> but it and its successor, the <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/TIE/D_Defender">TIE Defender,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> were shelved due to too many resources expended during internal civil war. Which was probably a good thing for the Rebels, seeing as how the Defender was widely considered to be the most advanced starfighter of its time.
</li><li> The Trade Federation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> uses two types of battle droids, that look the exact same. You have the OOM models, which possess advanced and independent programming, and the B1 models, which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">dumb as a box of rocks</a>. The kicker, the OOMs are the prototypes. You would think that with code being easily replicated, ALL battle droids would be OOMs, but instead the Trade Federation decided to shoot themselves in the foot. Expanded Universe sources indicate that they feared a droid army in which every soldier was capable of intelligent thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">might turn against them</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Batman's costume in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> is a prototype armor suit that was rejected by the army because it was too expensive. The same with the batmobile, which was designed for jumping gaps to lay cables for bridges.

When he asks why it isn't standard issue for normal soldiers, Howard Stark says it's because the metal used to make it is too rare to produce more copies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFalcon">The Falcon</a>'s flying exo-suit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> is a military prototype. No reason is given for why the suits never saw mass production, but it's implied that the other users had all been killed during combat in the Middle East. It was also designed for Para-Rescue. Among the U.S.'s special forces units, Para-Rescue is among the most difficult to succeed in, on par with Seal Team 6, if not outright more difficult. Training is often nicknamed "Superhero School". Given that it would naturally have a low radar profile, it was probably meant to be a poor man's Iron Man but was too costly, too narrow in mission, and had little-to-no body armor to protect the much more valuable man wearing it.
</li><li> Retroactively, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em> made Tony's first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> suits (particularly the Mark VII he used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers (2012)</a></em>) into these. Whereas Tony's first suits were made with quality over quantity, a new suit only being created to encompass several improvements at once, the dozens of suits he made between then and this film were comparatively slapdash, gimmicky, and overall individually impractical.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoboCop2">RoboCop 2</a></em>, a string of subsequent models failed in increasingly gruesome ways - it turns out there are certain qualities the person must possess for the operation to work properly.

The Uruks under his command don't pose half as much of a threat, and the ones that fight at the Hornburg one movie later are largely cut down en masse.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that this was deliberate. The design crew wanted to subtly imply that the Uruk-hai, as artificial lifeforms and perversions of nature, were flawed and quick to degenerate physically and mentally. Each time an individual Uruk-hai is seen it looks progressively older and in worse physical condition, because they are literally falling apart on the genetic level.

<ul><li> In Joel Shepherd's Cassandra Kresnov trilogy, the title character is a prototype of a new and improved version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">"GIs"</a> used as soldiers in interstellar combat. The main improvement is in her intelligence rather than her physical capabilities. She is creative and capable of lateral thought, making her more flexible and independent than lower level GIs who mostly serve as grunts that follow orders.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novel <em>Final Frontier</em> (no relation to the fifth movie), it was revealed that the <em>Enterprise</em> was the prototype for the <em>Constitution</em>-class line. It was deliberately overbuilt, explaining how Kirk (and Scotty) could constantly push it past its design limits. Constitution ships-of-the-line were economized, resulting in them being more delicate ships.

</li><li> Mack Maloney's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wingman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wingman">Wingman</a></em> series makes liberal use of this trope, particularly in the case of Hawk Hunter, the titular Wingman.

When circumstances force the Wingman to use a different type of aircraft for more than a chapter, he will generally take the time to similarly customize his new plane, often even transplanting the avionics from his F-16 into the aircraft.

He turns out not to have any apparent technological advantage over KITT (of course, KITT is hardly "production-line"), aside from a slightly improved speech module (in the next episode, KITT's is replaced by one similar to KARR's), though when KARR reappears in the third season, while still not more advanced than KITT, he does possess a number of features which KITT had only gained during the second season.
<ul><li> In the 2008 series, KARR is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">Transforming Mecha</a>, specifically designed for front-line combat. However, it was a failure, and a number of people died. KITT was designed as a car that could transform into other cars (e.g. a Mustang transforming into a pickup truck) and mainly designed for policing duties. However, the episode where KITT is shut down reveals that the military has always planned for KITT to be a temporary project. The goal was to have KITT develop as a fully-functional AI and then port that AI into KARR. The kicker? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both KARR and KITT have the same driver, the son of the original Michael Knight</span>.

The reason they were abandoned is because the zord tech hinges on bio-energy fields of living beings, and the Paleozords (based on dinosaurs, as you might have guessed from the name) were trying to connect to creatures that no longer existed, which made them powerful but uncontrollable. By the time the Rangers rediscovered them, the technology had advanced enough to bring them under control. Another example are with the morphers. The morphers used by Gem and Gemma are prototypes and thus do not carry the same energy limitations that the later versions used by the rest of the team. However, they also don't have the Burst Attacks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a>,</em> the Quantum Ranger morpher and Quantasaurus Rex Zord were created during the early days of Time Force, and lost in an early time travel experiment until being rediscovered. However, they're quite stronger than the main five Rangers and any of their tech. However, there's a drawback: the main five have a DNA lock, so only you or your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">Identical Grandson</a> can use it (hence Wes).

In its debut, it took a dozen Jem'hadar attack ships (just <em>three</em> of which had shown themselves capable of easily destroying the previous most powerful ship in Starfleet) to disable the <em>Defiant</em>, and that was after it was heavily damaged in an ambush. Not to mention, they hadn't even worked all the bugs out of the design yet; in later appearances it was even more formidable. The specs indicated that it was less than 1/10 the mass of the <em>Enterprise</em>-D yet carried armament equal to it. Starfleet eventually does make others which are apparently just as powerful (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including a replacement for the original when the Dominion finally manages to destroy it</span>), but it takes a while to get them into production. For a while she really was superior to others of her class simply because the fixes for the bugs violated Starfleet safety standards and took a while to get around; this came up both times other ships of the class appeared on the show. In addition, the original <em>Defiant</em> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">Invisibility Cloak</a> on loan from the Romulans; her sister ships don't.

The registry for the prototype ships usually have an NX prefix. The <em>Excelsior</em> was originally NX-2000 and was more of a testbed for the (ultimately failed) "Transwarp" engine more than anything else. Once the testing phase was over, she was given a proper NCC prefix. Otherwise, it didn't appear to completely outclass other starships like the <em>Enterprise</em> in terms of combat performance. In later series, it seemed that the <em>Excelsior</em> design was actually one of the most versatile in terms of longevity, the design showed up as modern starships as late as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>'s fourth season, more than 80 years after it was introduced.

<ul><li> It's fairly common for the prototype versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> machines to have features that get stripped out for the actual production run, usually for cost or technical reasons.

<ul><li> The "Boogie Man" slingshots on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/ScaredStiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/ScaredStiff">Scared Stiff</a></em>. The rubber figures on the slingshot bumpers were supposed to jolt each time the kicker fired, but it was found this would eventually cause the Boogie Men's arms to fly off, so they became fixed in place on the production versions; replacement kicker arms are available that make them mobile again.

The theme was meant to evoke early electromechanical pinball machines which used metal chimes to produce their sounds. The prototypes had three chime bars, but these were removed in the production cabinets and electronic sounds were substituted. Some owners have retrofitted chime units from other games.
</li><li> The Deadworld area in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> was supposed to lock balls for multiball, but it was found to be unreliable. Custom kits exist to restore that feature.

<ul><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>; while it is true that during the still-popular late Succession Wars era such older "lostech" designs as still existed in half-decent shape could be superior to anything of more modern manufacture, those were generally leftover ancient <em>production</em> models. Actual prototypes and first-generation designs using newly recovered or developed technologies tend to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">another trope</a> rather more straight (one very common fandom term for this is "new toy syndrome").
<ul><li> There <em>were</em> a number of prototypes in the Jihad era that are incredibly effective, and mount a number of high end "experimental" technologies that usually only show up on or two at a time on production models. When production versions of the designs were printed, they largely tended to be less powerful due to having reduced advanced/experimental tech on them for the reason that either it was decided that it wasn't necessary for their intended roles so reducing the advanced tech on them made them cheaper, or the specific bit of tech was considered too difficult to keep working in the field and so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">older and more reliable equipment</a> was used instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Since they're one of the only factions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> whose technology is actually <em>improving</em>, the Tau exhibit this trope when it comes to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">battlesuits</a>. Ace battlesuit jockeys are given the chance to field-test advanced prototypes, and if a Tau commander does <em>really</em> well they may end up with their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> suit. Unfortunately these shiny new features tend to come with a drawback or two, something notably absent in normal Tau technology.
<ul><li> This kinda applies to any sort of technology used by the Humans (of any faction). The most powerful weapons are inevitably some super-ancient prototype relic. Kind of hand-waved due to a.) the Adeptus Mechanicus's fear of inventing, b.) the relics themselves being of Alien origin and/or a sacred relic and c.) sometimes the owners flat out refuse to let anyone tinker around with their one-of-a-kind toy.
<ul><li> The Thunder Warriors are specifically stated to be cruder, more poorly armored versions of the process that creates modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a>, but at the same time, a single Thunder Warrior is to a squad of marines what marines themselves are to a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">regular guardsmen</a>. Unfortunately they are nowhere near as stable, mentally or physically. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Emperor had them all (mostly) wiped out after conquering Earth in favor of the more reliable Space Marines.</span>
</li><li> The Adeptus Custodes <em>may</em> qualify, as superior warriors rumored to be forged from the Emperor's gene-code, rather than a Primarch's. It's not clear whether the Custodes or the Space Marines came first, but it <em>has</em> been stated that bits and pieces of the Thunder Warriors process were adapted into their making. Unfortunately, as the comatose Emperor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">they spent millennia essentially confined to the role of the guarding the Imperial Palace since the Heresy</a>, and only started going out again once Roboute Guilliman woke up and visited the Palace.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with the Primarchs, who are superior to any other soldier the Imperium has and are the templates for almost all of the Space Marines in existence today. However, the process which created them was extremely intensive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">may or may not have involved stealing power from Hell to achieve</a> and the Emperor only managed to create 20 of them, which he later deemed to be used as the templates for the Space Marine Legions and commanders for said legions. They were, however, basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a> (from the Emperor's DNA himself) where Space Marines are people born normally with genetic engineering applied later.
</li><li> Much of the space marine legion's equipment are this to "modern day" 40k; the Cataphractii Terminator armor, Imperial Jetbikes, Hover Rhinos, Fellblade super-heavy tanks and the iconic Contemptor Dreadnoughts were all miles above their contemporaries in their roles and were once slated for mass production, but due to the onset of the Horus Heresy (where the majority of these went to the traitor legions and subsequently were destroyed) and the Imperium being gripped by superstition, they would never see it. After a few millennia, the method to make these were lost, and any existing suits were revered as relics, used only by the most hallowed member of their chapter or anyone already in possession of one. Many other such ancient pieces whose manufacture has been forgotten are also given to the Adeptus Custodes instead, making them the only force to field them in any significant capacity.
</li><li> Somewhat inverted with the World Eaters. While their Butcher's Nails are only crude imitations of the ones implanted in their Primarch's head, these copies do not run the risk of killing them as the originals would have eventually done to Angron if he hadn't become a Daemon Prince first.

<ul><li> There exists a version of The Seal of Orichalcos that was printed in very limited quantities (around 15) for a tournament event. While the mass-production version of the Seal is pretty mediocre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance">due to getting some heavy nerfs</a>, the prototype Seal is just as good as its anime counterpart, if not better.

Once the Crash 2.0 hit and the three of them are (apparently) gone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> are now roughly as powerful as human hackers in the Matrix (to the point where they are options for player characters).

The Gold Mamba was basically a prototype built at the same time as the common Black Mamba, but contrary to typical design theory (build something up until it works at the level you want), its designers approached it from the other side of the spectrum (put the most expensive equipment you can find on it and scale down until it doesn't work). This means that the Gold Mamba is an extremely powerful combat machine that is head and shoulders above the Black Mamba's performance, but ultimately it is extremely expensive and rare.
</li><li> The proxies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trinity">Trinity</a></em> were the first humans to become psions, and their psychic powers are noted to be significantly more powerful than later psions, as the process that created the proxies differed in important respects from the one used for other psions.

It released a quart of water in one second in a consistent stream that went up to 53 feet. It was so powerful it hurt kids and due to multiple complaints by parents the later CPS models were made less powerful. Due to its rarity it sells on eBay for $100s of dollars and specialized home-brew water guns are specifically designed to be compared against the CPS 2000 to determine if they can beat it.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Makuta Teridax</a> seemed to have a habit of creating prototypes that were much stronger than the mass-produced versions that'd come later, though in his case that was usually because his creations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">tended to be too intelligent or ambitious to serve his goals</a>, so he'd scale them back in power and intelligence to ensure they wouldn't become a threat. Also, he made them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">limited lifespans</a> to ensure they wouldn't remain a thorn in his side for too long even if he didn't bother with killing them.
</li><li> One of Makuta's creations, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFlora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFlora">Karzahni</a>, was this to its successor, the Morbuzakh. It had all the Morbuzakh's abilities (incredible strength, complete control of its vegetation, capable of intelligent thought and speaking), plus it lacked the need to feed off of fire and heat (since it survived just fine in the sun-less darkness of the tunnels between Metru Nui and Mata Nui) and possessed immunity to ice and cold (casually shattering a layer of ice over its form that would have crippled its successor for a time). However, it was far too ambitious and intelligent to be content with Makuta's plans for it and rebelled, so he banished it and made the Morbuzakh with the mentioned flaws (plus being less intelligent) so it would serve him alone. The Karzahni <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">did not like that in the slightest and started planning Teridax's downfall and death</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Av-Matoran</a> were the first type of Matoran, and can actively make use of their elemental powers compared to the other types of Matoran, allowing them to fire blasts of light energy and change the apparent colors of their armor to disguise themselves as other types of Matoran. They also can access unique special abilities when linked with a Toa.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> toyline often shows off advanced test models that closely resemble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowAccuracyToyAccuracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowAccuracyToyAccuracy">their media counterparts</a>, which are later modified/dumbed down to meet certain specifications, such as price, safety or quality standards (those with flight-capable alternate modes get more extensive drop tests). In some cases, a complex larger figure of a character gets a subsequent new mold that is smaller and simpler but are intended for some additional play value (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Combining Mecha</a>) or at least to offer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">less costly version of the character</a>. A particular example was the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> toyline&mdash;due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, the "preview" series of toys had a notably higher budget than the toyline that actually came out.

<ul><li> Proto Man is usually depicted as being much more capable than the later model, Mega Man, and due to a bug in his design, a flawed nuclear core, is the first robot in history to have full free will. On the flip-side, that same unstable core makes him far more vulnerable to damage and means his power reactor will catastrophically fail at some point (Implied to be <em>quite soon</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em>). On the plus side, being built with an energy source far more raw and unrestrained generally makes his buster output more powerful than his brother <em>or</em> Bass, enabling the extremely potent Proto/Blues Strike.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan11">Mega Man 11</a></em> with Wily's Double Gear system, which he developed back in his college days. After being reminded of it, Wily decides to revisit the concept, outfitting his 8 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> robot masters with Power and Speed Gears to vastly improve their capabilities. Fortunately, Dr. Light kept ahold of Wily's discarded prototype - containing both a Power <em>and</em> Speed Gear (compared to the robot masters who either have one or the other) - which he installs in Mega Man. However, at the end of the game, Wily reveals his own perfected Double Gear system installed in his personal Wily Capsule, which has all the benefits of Mega Man's plus an enhanced cooling system that ensures that it never overheats, thus unlike Mega Man he can leave both gears running at the same time indefinitely (which he does as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a>.)

He was built with the ability to make his own decisions like Proto Man above, but was built with a "suffering circuit" that would allow him to weigh the consequences of his actions. This, plus over a century of self-checks made X a perfect machine. The Reploids that were built from his blueprints, however, lacked the same power of his suffering circuit and the checks, which caused many of them to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Mavericks</a>. In general, the whole of the Mega Man franchise typically provides some viable explanation as to why a first draft might be superior to the later models.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">Original Generation</a> mecha of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> is <em>overloaded</em> with super prototypes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Customs</a>,and a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototypes</a> too; way, <em>way</em> too many to list on this page. Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars3">Super Robot Wars 3</a></em>. When you begin the game, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter Robo</a> team is piloting the Proto-Getter Robo. instead of normal Getter Robo. When Proto-Getter attacks and doesn't kill an enemy, Ryouma gripes that the Proto-Getter is just weaker than the normal Getter and is actually happy when the original Getter is dropped in a few stages later.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series, the prototype Metal Gear RAY is of far superior quality to the mass-produced models later encountered by Raiden as a boss battle; then again, it may have been actually designed for its supposed purpose (to defeat REX derivatives) whereas the mass-produced versions were actually tactical defense units for Arsenal Gear. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em>, Bladewolf, a prototype unmanned gear, is self-aware and pretty durable, while the mass-produced Fenrirs go down much faster and have less intelligence than a real dog.
</li><li> The original X-Blade from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> was practically this to the keyblade. It originally coexisted with the true Kingdom Hearts, acting as its guardian. However, numerous people used the X-Blade as the basis for their own keyblades, leading up to the inevitable Keyblade War for control over Kingdom Hearts, which sunk the world in darkness, killed every last keyblade wielder, and split the X-Blade into seven lights and thirteen darknesses.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Delphinus</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> is a possible example, but it's not entirely clear whether the weaker mass-produced equivalent (the Spectre-class battleships) are scaled-back mass production versions or the immediate predecessors of the Delphinus.
<ul><li> The Delphinus was a proof-of-concept model, but doesn't necessarily fit the trope, and THE Flagship for the entire Armada- it was overkill for the reason of it being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> essentially.
</li></ul></li><li> The fictional planes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> occasionally fall under this trope, particularly the X-49 Night Raven of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere">Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</a></em> and the ADFX-01 "Morgan" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War</a></em>, which is a super prototype of the later (in the series original world timeline) and much more advanced ADF-01 "FALKEN". The Morgan zig-zags this, however, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> flies a Super Prototype <em>of</em> the Super Prototype (he gets an ADFX-0<em>2</em> that carries all three special weapons at once while your -01 is stuck with one at a time), and then the later FALKEN is overall somewhat better (it only gets a fuel-air bomb instead of the multi-purpose burst missile the Morgan gets, but its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Tactical Laser System</a> carries more shots, holds the beam twice as long, and deals more damage per second).
<ul><li> The real planes also have a bit of this. <em>5</em> in particular both subverts it (the F-15 S/MTD is better than the stock F-15 it was modified from) and plays it straight (the S-32 is better than the later Su-47).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatXSkiesOfDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatXSkiesOfDeception">Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception</a></em> brought us the Fenrir. The original models had optical camouflage, ungodly maneuverability and a microwave weapon. The production models don't have any of that aside from the ungodly maneuverability at the cost of ammo. In the same vein, the Varcolac from <em>Joint Assault</em> is shown to have a rear mounted machine gun that shoots down any and all missiles that approach it. In game, it doesn't have that but it's still the best plane in the game if you give it the right mods.
</li><li> Ace Combat's love of Super Prototypes reaches absolutely absurd levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatInfinity">Ace Combat Infinity</a></em>, which brings in no less than six variants of the Morgan/FALKEN line, - starting from a "Block 1" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> of the Morgan, on through the regular Morgan, through to Pixy's version with higher stats, then on to the FALKEN, and from there on to the ADA-01 ADLER, a ground-focused counterpart to the FALKEN, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat2">Ace Combat 2</a></em> version of the original FALKEN.
</li></ul></li><li> The Living Failures of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> are meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> of Celestial Emissary since the test subject failed to ascend into kins of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Great Ones</a>. Despite how "failed" it sounded like, they are far deadlier than their successors and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">conjure meteors</a>. One wonder why the Healing Church did not weaponise them instead.
</li><li> The Smithy Gang in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em> (Mack, Bowyer, Yaridovich and the Axem Rangers) are the super prototype models for their production lines. When you reach the last area, you discover that Smithy is creating an entire army of the bosses, though the machine-made versions are less powerful than the actual bosses.
</li><li> The Edelweiss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>, made by Isara's father for Welkin's father for the previous war. Unlike most super-prototypes.it was actually put forward to Gallian High Command. It was found to be an incredible tank, but it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">too expensive for any kind of mass production</a>.
</li><li> Subject Delta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> isn't just a Big Daddy &mdash; he's the <em>first</em> Big Daddy; unlike the production models, he's nimble and has plasmid powers. It's justified in-universe by a whole host of problems with that particular series: they were too costly, their free will made them far more difficult to control, and are permanently bonded to a single Little Sister and doomed to death or violent insanity once she's gone. The newer models, while not quite as advanced, are physically stronger, more durable, and lack free will, and have no preference for any particular Little Sister, all of which better suit the one task they are built for.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BioShockInfinite/BurialAtSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BioShockInfinite/BurialAtSea">Burial at Sea</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> features a Bouncer Big Daddy that is able to launch its drill and pull enemies towards him. According to a chalkboard in Suchong's lab, this feature was removed because the hydraulic fluids/gases needed for this caused the Bouncer to become unstable.

However, as the prototype model, his power is greater than that of his "brothers", and his lifespan is much longer, as well.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also in a far darker sense Kuja is a Prototype of the real Angel of Death Zidane, though it is arguable who is more powerful/competent</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>'s Kefka was the very first Magitek Knight (a normal human given magical powers by way of an infusion from an Esper). He consistently has much stronger magic then Celes, a later-generation Magitek Knight that joins your party.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28ofb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28ofb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28ofb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The first time you fight him as a boss, he is Level 18, and has spells like Blizzara, Poison, Drain, and all three 1st level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning">Fire, Ice, Lightning</a> spells. Celes would only have Blizzard, Antidote, Imp, Cure, and Scan at that same level.</span> Unfortunately, as a prototype, he was exposed to an imperfect version of the infusion process, which resulted in him going just a teensy bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">insane</a>.
</li><li> In the <em>Compilation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Sephiroth is a super prototype who is much stronger and more powerful than regular SOLDIERs and much more physically stable than the competing Project G prototypes Angeal and Genesis, who are subject to degradation. Unfortunately, Sephiroth could not be duplicated and he cannot replicate his genetic traits in monsters (like Angeal) or in humans (like Genesis). Later, Hojo made a series of experimental transhumans called Sephiroth Clones, never meant for actual combat, to test some properties of the augmenting technology in question; one of these prototypes is our main protagonist, who ended up no less powerful than the original himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission3">Front Mission 3</a></em> has a couple interesting examples.
<ul><li> In the start of the game your character is a test pilot for Kirishima Heavy Industries and your first mission is actually a final test run of a new prototype Wanzer for the Japanese Defense Forces. The Shunyo Mk. 111 is far more powerful than the test Wanzers you fight against.
</li><li> The true Super Prototype of the game, though, is the Hoshun. This is a Wanzer that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is somehow sent to you through the Internet</span> and not only has more HP than any other pilotable Wanzer, but also has one of the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">beam rifles</a> in existence.
</li><li> Interestingly, the starting wanzer Kazuki pilots, the Zenith RV (misromanized as Zenislev), is the super prototype of the next game, Front Mission 4, obtainable in Elsa's scenario. Since 4 canonically happens before 3, this indicates how much Wanzer development has progressed.
</li></ul></li><li> Prometheus, the last boss in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starsiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starsiege">Starsiege</a></em> human campaign, is the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">Cybrid</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarZero">Phantasy Star Zero</a></em> makes fun of this trope to a degree. Occasionally you will find messages with tips in them. A message talking about a particular robotic enemy in that area says, "Production model &amp; Prototype. Do we need to spell out which one is more powerful?"
</li><li> The backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn">Virtual-ON</a></em> provides both aversions and straight examples. Some prototypes like Viper Alpha and Proto Temjin have inferior armaments to their production model. Original Fei Yen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">much more powerful than the production model</a> but is sentient and eventually runs away from lab.

The adversary tries to deny your prize on the grounds that it was an unfair advantage, but the prize, being a Jedi, takes matters into her own hands by breaking out and killing most of the bad guys.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meier&#146;s Alpha Centauri</a></em>, any prototype starts out one Morale (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">experience</a>) level ahead of a normal unit produced at the same base. This means that, with a Command Center and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Bioenhancement Center</a>, a prototype is Elite right off the rack. However, this is justified in the background material: Factions entrust their newest tech to their most experienced and effective troops and crews; the actual equipment is not significantly different from that given to subsequent units. Furthermore, prototypes take longer to build (unless the base has a Skunkworks facility), indicating the extra resources needed to work out the kinks. The actual equipment is probably not a prototype at all, just first-generation production with a best-of-the-best crew.
<ul><li> An interesting exception is the Spartan Federation; because of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">martial focus</a>, one of their unique traits is that they do not have to prototype new unit designs, with the effect that (1) the first of a unit type does not take extra time to build but (2) the first of a new unit type doesn't get the experience advantage available to other factions. This is probably a game balance consideration, as <em>all</em> Spartan units get a +2 Morale advantage by default.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has some really powerful prototype stuff. Example: MPLX Novasurge, a unique plasma pistol which greatly increases damage and the critical multiplier at the cost of doubled power usage and weight. It was developed by a "Section: A61" shortly before the Great War broke out. The prototype survived the war by being beamed aboard Mothership Zeta approx. 200 years before the Lone Wanderer found it in the ship's cargo hold.. Or the MP-47/A power armor prototype with a built-in medical dispenser and an onboard AI. And the Capital Wasteland's sole set of T-51b power armor(not counting the indestructible Winterized version from <em>Operation: Anchorage</em>). Finally, there's Liberty Prime, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> built for the Anchorage Reclamation, but kept out of battle due to problems with its power supply.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> shows that at least one prototype model of eyebots had a TV-screen, and not just a built-in radio. ED-E, however, is <em>not</em> quite this trope, despite being a prototype and much more powerful than its mass-produced cousins: it was the prototype to a series of combat-adapted eyebots that were scrapped in favor of Hellfire power armor, with the common eyebot being its predecessor rather than its successor.
</li><li> There's also the Tesla-Beaton Prototype, a unique Tesla cannon, and the AER-14, a prototype Laser Rifle with a green laser. The Q-35 Matter Modulator is an example and also has some backstory to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> why the FO3 plasma rifle is so different from the original plasma rifle (dubbed the "Plasma Caster" in NV): The plasma caster was too expensive, had an awkward form factor, and required too much training to be proficient in, so a military project was started to adapt it to a more familiar pistol grip rifle form factor, and lower the cost. This is because the original plasma caster was meant as a construction tool rather than a weapon - it's basically a really big welding torch, and as a result, while it's one of the strongest energy weapons around, it also has a massive spread due to being completely unergonomic.
<ul><li> <em>Old World Blues</em> has the Stealth Suit Mark II, which like the Medic Power Armor, has an onboard AI that automatically dispenses Med-X and Stimpaks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> adds the T-60 Power Armor, a step above the T-51 armor that was previously used. It was only beginning to be deployed experimentally (one of the Vault's military guards is wearing a suit of this armor in the pre-War sequence) when the Great War happened.
<ul><li> There's also a unique version of the Railway Rifle called "Prototype Railway Rifle". However, the player expecting it to follow the usual workings of this trope - and indeed of every other unique weapon in the game - will be disappointed: it gets subverted and does piddling damage, has poor range and only holds one round. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">It behaves, in other words, exactly how you'd expect from an unfinished prototype.</a>
</li><li> As revealed in <em>Far Harbor</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nick Valentine was one of the two prototype Synths capable of independent thinking and judgement, the other being DiMA. Rather than being junked by the Institute as he believed, he actually escaped alongside his "brother" DiMA.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A similar effect occurs with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> Experimental units. Any player will realize that these 'experiments' are always a great success, and utterly trounce dozens if not hundreds of the 'tested' units. And although you can build more than one of them, the too-expensive-justification is in full effect, as you need a very solid economy before you can start building one.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> where a prototype superweapon called <em>Odin</em> is stolen from the Dominion. It doesn't just have more hit points than any other unit in the game and do more damage than anything short of hero units &mdash; it's also got several luxury amenities, including a restroom for the driver and an onboard nuke launcher. Rory Swann, the engineer of <em>Hyperion</em>, says it's too impractical to mass-produce, at least with the facilities available to Raynor's Raiders, so a scaled-down machine called a Thor is slated for mass production. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Oddly, the Dominion seems to have agreed with Swann, as the Odin is one of a kind and the Dominion only ever fields Thors aside from it.</a>) There's also the <em>Loki</em>, a prototype for a new class of battleship, which boasts ridiculous firepower and toughness, completed at the same research station. The <em>Loki</em> at least is destroyed, which may be why that never went anywhere.
<ul><li> The <em>Loki</em> may have been destroyed, but during the "Fire in the Sky" Zerg mission multiple similar looking Battlecruiser's appear, which may be the mass produced version to the <em>Loki</em>'s super prototype. There's also the <em>Pride of Augustgrad</em>, and the <em>Jackson's Revenge</em> mercenary ship, both of which look identical to the <em>Loki</em>; the implication is that <em>Jackson's Revenge</em> is an old ship retrofitted to be competitive on the modern battlefield, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> of sorts, and perhaps the <em>Pride of Augustgrad</em> and <em>Loki</em> were test beds for normalizing such upgrades for the production models fought in the Zerg campaign.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">King Oni</a> is a hulking behemoth capable of bull-charging enemy tanks and shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> for the glory of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Empire of the Rising Sun</a>. Apparently, the original King Oni is a super prototype, given to Emperor Yoshiro as a gift, which he uses when the enemy approaches his palace. It notably includes a set of Rocket Launchers for dealing with aerial threats, something the standard King Oni lacks. It's implied that this King Oni takes much more maintenance to take care of than the standard King Oni, but given that it's the <em>Emperor's</em> personal machine, no expense was spared.
<ul><li> In the <em>Uprising</em> expansion, the Soviet Reaper unit is a super prototype for the Sickle. While the Sickle is only armed with machine guns, the Reaper boasts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">automatic grenade launchers</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">roof-mounted rocket launcher</a>. However, unlike the Sickle, the Reaper's legs can barely support its weight and will snap off if it tries to leap like a Sickle. This is reflected in its special ability, which allows it to leap once and become a stationary turret wherever you want it to land.

While it's unknown what happened between him and Jack (both survived the original tournament), P. Jack was soundly scrapped by Jack-2 in <em>Tekken 2</em>. However, P. Jack's ability to fly was implemented in all subsequent playable Jack models.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish">Vanquish</a></em>, the ARS armor that Sam Gideon is wearing is a prototype of a new weapons system being developed by DARPA, and he is taking it along on the assault on Providence for two reasons: to test out its capabilities in live fire combat, and because the military is desperate for any weapon they can use to stop the colony's microwave array from being fired. In-game, it is indicated that the ARS has several limitations, primarily among them being that the suit will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">explode if it overheats too much.</a>
</li><li> The Excavated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">ATACs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardBandits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardBandits">Vanguard Bandits</a></em> are super prototypes from which all basic ATACs were reverse-engineered.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Spartan-IIs are this to the Spartan-IIIs and IVs. The IIs tend to be larger, stronger, and just more naturally talented overall, due being subject to a much more stringent selection criteria than their successors. On top of all that, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">MJOLNIR armor</a> is far better than the III's SPI armor (though <em>not</em> the IV's GEN2 MJOLNIR). On the other hand, the IIs were also much more costly to produce and equip, and the process of augmenting them had a much higher failure rate than with the IIIs and IVs, making them much fewer in numbers and much less expendable. That said, there were some IIIs that were considered the rough equals of the IIs, such as those of Noble Team, who were given their own sets of MJOLNIR.
</li><li> The IVs are superior in both equipment quality and numbers compared to their III and II predecessors. However, while the IVs <em>are</em> highly-skilled volunteers drawn from the best veterans and recruits, the IIIs and IIs were both trained to be the perfect soldiers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">childhood</a></em>; this difference manifests itself most clearly in the comparatively lesser skill and professionalism of the IVs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has also stated that the IVs' physical augmentations are inferior to those of their predecessors.
</li><li> Averted by the Spartan-I program, which did not have the success that the later programs did; if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sergeant Johnson</span> and the "1.0s" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/ILoveBees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ARG/ILoveBees">I Love Bees</a></em> are any indication, they're just slightly better than the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normals</a>. In fact, the Spartan program as a whole had to be renamed from "Project Orion" in order to distance the S-IIs from their predecessors (who themselves were retroactively renamed "Spartan-Is" to acknowledge they <em>did</em> provide the necessary data for the success of the later programs). Admittedly, the Orions <em>were</em> very effective soldiers, but just not quite good enough to prevent the Insurrection from spreading, not to mention that far too many of them started to experience severe degenerative side effects from the augmentations, both mental and physical.
</li><li> There's also the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.halopedia.org/HRUNTING/YGGDRASIL_Mark_I_Prototype_Armor_Defense_System">HRUNTING/YGGDRASIL Mark I<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, which was this to the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.halopedia.org/HRUNTING/YGGDRASIL_Mark_IX_Armor_Defense_System">Mark IX "Mantis"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>. Whereas the Mark I had flight, rockets, chainguns, mines, a bubble shield, and <em>a nuclear self-destruct system</em>, the Mantis usually only has a chaingun, a rocket launcher, and standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a>; the latter's still a force to be reckoned with, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> normally averts this trope, and hero Gears are usually either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Customs</a> or relics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>. The one major case of a prototype that's clearly superior to the followup model is Grahf's Alpha Weltall, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is built using 4000-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Nanotechnology</a> that can't be replicated in the modern world.

Despite her initial form being labelled "alpha", when asked about it she says she's feature-complete and only carries the moniker because her creator wanted to tweak her U.I. It actually goes deeper than that, as it's discovered Poppi isn't the first functional artificial Blade... which means she benefits from additional development time and a superior power source, and can fight her predecessors to a standstill easily.

She's got even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> tech (too energy-consuming to move or deploy the plasma shield, but <em>still</em>...) even in-game, the difference between the <em>Lightning</em> and the other ships is explicitly compared to a fully-tuned and upgraded car against one fresh from the dealership.
</li><li> Zigzagged in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series. Prototype vessels tend to fare differently than their production versions, some having quirks that make them better or worse (such as higher weapon energy recharge but lower rudder speed). That said, some ships designated as prototypes fit the trope: The Paranid Hyperion Vanguard is a limited prototype run of Corvettes that far eclipses all other corvette classes (Among its many advantages, its the only one that can carry fighters and is either the top or tied for top in terms of speed, durability, and offensive potential amongst M6 vessels). The Hyperion Vanguard never entered full production run however (Which is why they cannot be bought by the player - only acquired through boarding existing copies). And all prototype ships, once they're acquired, can be reverse-engineered and then produced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerHeadquarters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerHeadquarters">Player Headquarters</a> in practice like the factory-produced versions. The only ship that cannot be reverse-engineered is the Xperimental Shuttle, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth">X Rebirth</a></em>, the player salvages a one-off prototype, the <em>Pride of Albion</em> (now the "<em>Albion Skunk</em>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">much to the chagrin of the pilot</a>), which was designed to fight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar">Second Terraformer War</a>. It's a hybridized ship combining the best features of both the old M3 Fighter and an M6 Corvette classes - it's maneuverable, very powerful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroneDeployer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroneDeployer">carries a compliment of drones in a wide variety of flavors</a>, and one of the fastest ships around, but it was never put into mass production due to excessive production costs.
</li></ul></li><li> As one might expect from a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GihrensGreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GihrensGreed">Gihren's Greed</a></em> has its share of Super Prototypes. However, it plays both the "production cost" and "only super until obsolete" angles brutally straight. For the former, building an army of Gundams is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">prohibitively expensive</a> while a force of GMs will do the job at a fraction of the cost and so the Super Prototypes are best used as force multipliers at the hands of ace pilots, while for the latter as technology marches on Super Prototypes from earlier in the game will struggle against and later be completely outclassed by later models (e.g. the original RX-78 Gundam will barely be able to keep up against Zeta era mooks like Hi-Zacks).
<ul><li> This is actually mentioned with the Prototype Gundam Mk-II's backstory: the machine was stupidly powerful and was made with performance over cost in mind; thus, when it was done, it was a machine that couldn't be piloted unless you were <em>extremely</em> skilled (or a Newtype) and it cost as much as a fleet of <em>Pegasus</em>-class warships<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37210');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note37210" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37210');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That's the same class as the <em>White Base</em>.</span>
</li><li> Of course, being based on Gundam this is sometimes played with or even subverted:
<ul><li> The prototype versions of some machines like the Gouf or Dom are actually inferior in some regards to their mass produced brothers due to being testbeds for new technology rather than being combat models.
</li><li> The prototype Gelgoog is slightly more powerful than the mass produced version (usually shown via higher health and other stats), but is otherwise exactly the same as the mass produced version. The ace customs versions, however, are often much more potent.
</li><li> Some Super Prototypes have unique features that result in them still seeing use long after becoming obsolete. The RX-78 is one of the only Federation mobile suits that can fight underwater, and vastly outperforms the other two options the Aqua GM and Aqua Gundam (which is just an Aqua GM with a Gundam-style head and a beam gun). As a result, a Federation player may feel desperate enough to build the RX-78 to counter the much more numerour underwater MS Neo Zeon can field. The Xamel and Rhinoceros both have extremely long range artillery cannons that can still make them useful long after they become obsolete.
</li><li> The prototype Pegasus is inferior to the White Base, which is treated in-game like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a> unit instead. Mass produced Pegasus class ships are based on the protoype.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Another <em>Gundam</em> game, <em>The Blue Destiny</em>, features the three prototype Blue Destiny units, based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">The 08th MS Team</a></em>'s RX-79(G) Gundam Ground Type units, extensively modified with a new control system. BD-1 used a GM head and was still ground-based, while BD-2 and BD-3 both sported Gundam heads and were modified for space use. Their control systems were based on a Zeon prototype, the MS-08TX(EXAM) Efreet Custom, whose designer defected from Zeon to the Federation.
<ul><li> <em>Blue Destiny</em> received a pseudo-sequel called <em>Missing Link</em>, which focuses on an offshoot of the EXAM project known as the HADES system. Only one prototype ever has the system installed: the RX-80PR Pale Rider. It's so powerful that the unit is still effective <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">10 years later, during the Neo-Zeon Wars, where it is finally taken down in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">Mutual Kill</a> with a Queen Mansa (one of the most successful Mobile Armor designs Neo-Zeon ever produced).</span>

<ul><li> The first unlockable Prototype: The Feisar Prototype, can exceed massive speed but it only speeds up when hitting speed pads.
</li><li> Second unlockable: The Auricom Prototype. It deals a decent amount of damage and doesn't get slowed down or wipes out when hit by a weapon. It can't pick up defensive weapons though and if you aren't careful, you won't notice when your craft is on low energy.
</li><li> Third unlockable: AG-Systems Prototype. Fast, ultra-agile and hard-hitting, but has the weakest shielding in the game.
</li><li> Fourth unlockable: Qirex Prototype. Sacrifices normal weapons for a special cannon which is even more powerful than the Plasma Bolt itself.

Prometheus</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, was this, as the mass produced Advanced Escorts removed the Multi-Vector Assault Mode (which allowed it to separate it into three parts) due to parts being easy to damage. Then, they put it back for the special variants.
<ul><li> For a fun thing, one of the purchasable add-ons is the NX prefix for all Federation ships. As it is cosmetic, there's nothing big about it beyond RP material, but with all the special high-ranking gear, you could pretty much say that you <em>are</em> flying a Super Prototype.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfLegends">Rise of Legends</a></em>, the Vinci faction has the Prototype Factory which allows the making of a Super Prototype unit. While these types of units are individually unique, choosing to make one will lead to overall bonuses to units that the Super Prototype was related to and these bonuses persisted even if the Super Prototype unit was destroyed. For example, making the unique Siege Zeppelin will lead to all your Steam Cannons becoming more powerful. These Super Prototype units are usually far better than the units that benefit from their development (such as the Siege Zeppelin to the Steam Cannons and Zeke the Robot to the Steam Fortress and Defense Tower).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Prime items</a> are invariably stronger than their present-day Tenno reproductions. With Warframes, the difference tends to be fairly minor, but most Prime weapons see a significant boost in power over their production models. Naturally, Orokin technology was so far beyond anything the rest of the system could create even to this day that it's incredibly difficult to replicate; most efforts depend on scrounging up components and blueprints from Orokin ruins. Umbra Warframes serve as another level of this, crossing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">Psycho Prototype</a>: while they were immensely powerful at taking down Sentients, their rage made them uncontrollable. Ivara's Leverian story later implies that Prime Warframes are NOT in fact, prototypes, subverting this. Rather, the non-Prime models were in fact the originals, and are tested to see if they're worth keeping. Those that survive their ordeals and prove their worth were rewarded with the superior, Primed versions of their models, while ones that failed were scrapped and forgotten.

Gilgamesh has almost all the prototypes of every Servant's Noble Phantasm (exceptions include Berserker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">God Hand</a> and Saber's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avalon</span>), and goes on to explain exactly why his prototypes are that much more powerful.

It gets a little complicated after this. Gilgamesh's versions are actually more powerful in a one to one contest, but the copies can be spammed via a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>: "breaking" one of the weapons unleashes a very powerful attack (at the obvious cost of sacrificing the weapon) but since <em>unlimited copies can be made</em> this weakness no longer applies to them.

Most notably, the first robot of the Seraph series, S1, looks much better than the more recent ones. And it has actual hands, rather than the simple claws of the later S models.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder18" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> As a general rule of thumb, there are two types of prototypes: concepts that barely work, and just demonstrate what the finished product could be; and stuff that has more buttons and features and flashing lights than you can imagine, and is prohibitively expensive or complicated to make on a wide scale. Super Prototypes are the latter category.
</li><li> On expos showing new cars or military technology, the displayed products will almost always have superior stats or better looks than the finished versions. This, however, is because said prototypes, while more powerful, may have their stats so high-powered they become self-damaging from simply doing anything. Hence finished versions have to be toned down.
</li><li> Military prototypes coming out of less technologically-advanced countries often fall under this trope. The prototype is often hand-crafted by a procession of engineers and scientists that have access to extremely complex high-precision tools, thus granting superior performance. When the designs hit factory lines, though, such precision tools are often unavailable, and mass-production tends to favor production efficiency over precision. This can be mitigated by good quality control, but in desperate war-time situations, such steps can and will be skipped over in favor of increased production. For example, take the A6M Type Zero, the (in)famous WWII Japanese fighter. Without sufficient factories to meet wartime needs (Many suitable factories had been destroyed by US strategic bombing), high school students were occasionally conscripted for manufacturing purposes. Ultimately, this led to a significant amount of unusable parts, aircraft that were sometimes barely able to fly, and aircraft that would come apart during normal use.
<ul><li> Nazi Germany had a wide variety of tanks, aircraft, guns, munitions, systems, etc. that performed well as prototypes (though not as well as some fanboys would have you believe) but were anywhere from downgraded to disastrous in mass production. Why? Well, they used lots of concentration camp inmates and POWs as slave labor, which unsurprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">bit their quality control in the ass</a>. Some of these slaves, having been selected for their technical skills, came up with some fairly brilliant and hard-to-notice methods of sabotaging whatever the Nazis forced them to manufacture. Among the most prominent examples was the Me-262 jet fighter, whose engines were found to be extremely delicate and would often violently disengage themselves from the airframe if the pilot adjusted the throttle the wrong way.
</li></ul></li><li> Performance automobiles enter this arena. It's not unusual for the actual prototypes to a new sports car to begin as non-functional mockups (sometimes even clay sculptures) to test things like aerodynamics and weight distribution. However when the vehicle is shown off at highly prominent car shows, automakers will reveal a pre-production model with body options and engine features that are not street legal, exuberantly expensive to manufacture, inherently dangerous (no safety equipment or pollution control), and even one-of-a-kind. These things can make the show car have performance capabilities above and beyond what the consumer would get from the production version without major aftermarket modifications.
<ul><li> One particular example was the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XJ220">Jaguar XJ220<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, unveiled as a concept for a car show and never intended for production, but so many were prepared to buy one they decided to modify it to make it suitable for production, taking deposits of fifty thousand pounds, non-refundable, locking buyers into contracts to oblige them to buy the final product at three hundred and fifty thousand pounds. The concept had everything a man in crisis could want - V12 powerplant to rival the Italian supercar brands, scissor doors, 4-wheel-drive, 4-wheel-steering; three years later Jaguar tells you the car has only rear-wheel-drive, front-wheel-steering, normal doors, and the engine is now only a V6 with awful turbo-lag, and the price had actually <em>increased by over forty thousand pounds</em>. You were given the option of buying your way out of the contract. Try to sue and the court will find in Jaguars' favour. Really, they wouldn't, under the right conditions, have ever needed to deliver a single car. World economic problems added to this, and eventually only 275 cars out of a projected 350 were built, and not all of them sold.
</li></ul></li><li> Bell P-39 Airacobra, whose prototype had powerful armament and turbosupercharger. USAAF wanted the production aircraft without the turbo and heavily armoured, reducing the performance dramatically.
<ul><li> Subverted with the Lend-Lease Airacobras supplied to the USSR. Because the Soviets used them in a completely different role (as low-altitude frontline fighters, instead of the high-altitude escorts), the lack of turbocharger didn't bother them much, as it mainly affected the high-altitude perfomance<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4l25v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4l25v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4l25v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And the Soviet mechanics uprated the engines anyway by reboring them and increasing the compression &#151; this drastically shortened their service lives, but with the Eastern Front attrition rates very few planes survived even this shortened period anyway.</span>, but Soviet pilots appreciated the heavy armor and powerful armament very much. In the Soviet Union Airacobra turned out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> machine, and most of the Allies best aces flew P-39 during some part of their careers, but the original prototype probably wouldn't shine there so much, as it was geared for the different mission.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States Navy's first six sailing frigates after it was re-established with the Naval Act of 1794 exhibit this trope, both among themselves and in relation to the Navy's later fighting sail. The first three of the six&mdash;<em>United States</em>, <em>Constellation</em>, and <em>Constitution</em>&mdash;were completed first. The latter three&mdash;<em>Congress</em>, <em>Chesapeake</em>, and <em>President</em>&mdash;were put on hold for several years, but then completed and launched during the Quasi-War with France. <em>United States</em>, <em>Constellation</em>, and <em>Constitution</em> account for <em>all</em> of the victories against foreign warships attained by the six frigates. To add insult to injury, <em>President</em> and <em>Chesapeake</em> were the only ships of the six to be <em>defeated</em> by foreign warships&mdash;and <em>President</em> was a "half-sister" to <em>United States</em> and <em>Constitution</em>, having significant modifications to her design which made her faster than her predecessors!
</li><li> The world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVN-65">USS Enterprise (CVN-65)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, was a one-of-a-kind super prototype of the later <em>Nimitz</em>-class carriers. Equipped with <strong>8(!)</strong> nuclear reactors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5iid9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5iid9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5iid9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">because the output of the nuclear reactors available at the time wasn't high enough to allow for a single-reactor design (even modern <em>Nimitz</em> and <em>Gerald Ford</em>-class carriers still need a pair of reactors) and also because it was seen as only natural that the 8 boilers of a conventional supercarrier would be replaced by 8 reactors in a nuclear supercarrier</span> and advanced electronic systems on a unique square island structure, the "Big E" was later surpassed in displacement by the <em>Nimitz</em> carriers, but remained the longest military vessel in the world until her retirement in 2013. The excessive cost of the <em>Enterprise</em> and her 8-reactor layout resulted in the Navy shelving the nuclear carrier concept with proposed sister ship USS <em>America</em> being re-ordered as a conventionally powered <em>Kitty Hawk</em>-class carrier and the USS <em>John F. Kennedy</em> also being converted to conventional propulsion during construction. The US Navy would not commission another nuclear carrier until 13 years later in 1975.
<ul><li> <em>Enterprise</em> is the subject of a number of rumors about having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> top speed due to her large number of reactors with 50 knots the figure typically being cited.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6wjp7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6wjp7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6wjp7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> While the octet of reactors certainly put out insane amounts of power, the logarithmically increasing hydrodynamic resistance at higher speeds means that even if they did meet the necessary output, it would do really nasty (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">possibly catastrophic</a>) things to the engines and shafts</span> These are generally untrue, with <em>Enterprise</em> achieving a 35-knot maximum speed like the fastest carriers with a conventional power plant; however, the 8-reactor plant allowed <em>Enterprise</em> to generate steam more quickly than her successors or her escorts,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7g4s9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7g4s9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7g4s9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the 1960s most ships still used steam and rapid-acceleration gas turbines were a new, relatively rare technology.</span> allowing for faster acceleration and less competition for steam between the catapults, electrical generators, and engines.
</li><li> One major advantage the <em>Enterprise</em> did have over conventionally powered ships was that her nuclear power plant could not only move her very quickly (the <em>Iowa</em>-class battleships were the only conventionally powered surface ships in the fleet that could match her speed for any distance, as ships benefit from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Square-Cube Law</a>), but could also do so for a <em>very</em> long time, as the fuel capacity for her nuclear reactors was measured in decades. Even though similarly sized conventional carriers could keep pace with her, they still had to stop to take on more fuel, while <em>Enterprise</em> could dedicate the extra carrying capacity to carry more fuel and munitions for her air wing.
</li></ul></li><li> USS <em>Lexington</em> (CV-2) and her sister Saratoga had numerous features that many other aircraft carriers wouldn't see for decades to come. Most notably they featured an enclosed "hurricane" bow that reduced wind interference during flight operations. Another first was the placement of the smokestack directly behind the island, a feature that her successor, the USS Ranger, didn't replicate. They also boasted more flight deck space than any of America's other wartime carriers.
</li><li> USS <em>Midway</em> ended up becoming this to her two sisters, <em>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</em> and <em>Coral Sea.</em> Both of later two ships didn't have the fortune of being built entirely under World War II budgets and cost cutting measures were taken. <em>FDR</em> in particular was rushed to response to fears of budget cuts and her material condition quickly degraded and she was scrapped more than a decade before her sisters left service. <em>Coral Sea</em> served almost as long as <em>Midway,</em> but <em>Midway</em> was still considered to be the more reliable of the two vessels and received more frequent modernizations.
</li><li> The Pennsylvania Railroad was known to have built more than a few super prototype locomotives which were then never duplicated or scaled back for production. One of these was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRR_FF1">class FF1 electric locomotive<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which was built in 1917 to test concepts related to electrifying steep mountain grades. Equipped with 4 1150hp synchronous AC motors the unit, nicknamed "Big Liz", developed a then astonishing 140,000 pounds of tractive effort. Unfortunately Big Liz turned out to be an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">Tim Taylor Technology</a>. When pulling trains her power would pull out the couplers. When reassigned to pusher service Big Liz pushed with so much force that on one test train cars began to pop out of the middle. Big Liz was simply too much power in one locomotive for 1917 rolling stock.
<ul><li> The other PRR example was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRR_S1">class S1 duplex steam locomotive<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with its distinctive design became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for 1930's art deco streamlined locomotives even though only one was ever built. The longest steam locomotive ever built, the S1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">spent its first two years of life on display at the 1939/40 New York World's Fair</a> before being released to service. Designed to haul 1000 tons at 100 mph it frequently was capable of much more, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">its great length restricted it to service on one section of main track</a> between Crestline, OH and Chicago. It also had a nasty wheelslip problem that could destroy the running gear in seconds if not quickly corrected at high speed. The 52 production T1 class locomotives were much less ambitious while still providing stellar performance.
</li><li> In the UK, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GER_Decapod">Great Eastern Railway Class A55 Decapod<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: a steam locomotive built to match the acceleration of then-current electric trains. Built to prove a political point, the design never went into production.
</li><li> Zigzagged with the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BR_Standard_Class_8">British Rail Standard Class 8<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> passenger steam locomotive. Only one was built, 71000 <em>Duke of Gloucester</em>, and performed poorly in service, burning too much coal and not producing enough power. Since BR was planning on getting rid of steam in the near future, it was decided not to go through the expensive and extensive engineering process of improving the <em>Duke</em>, which was withdrawn after only eight years of service. It was rescued from the scrapyard, however, and during its restoration it was found that the deficiencies were caused by minor flaws in design of certain elements, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">certain features being altered or omitted on the order of higher-ups</a>. With these flaws corrected, the <em>Duke</em> is not only one of the most efficient steam locomotives ever built, but is significantly more powerful than the diesels that replaced it.
</li><li> The Intercity Experimental, prototype predecessor to the Intercity Express of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DeutscheBahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DeutscheBahn">Deutsche Bahn</a>, had a lot of features that would only be seen in revenue service decades later or never. It also had a higher top speed (which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>, as trial runs in Europe have to be done with the top speed +10% to give a safety reserve)
</li><li> There were trial runs with prototype electric trains in 1903 on a military railway in Prussia that was equipped with prototype overhead wires for that purpose. The trains reached 200 km/h, but none of them ever entered revenue service and neither did the electrification system.
</li><li> The British <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Passenger_Train">Advanced Passenger Train<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> holds several records that have yet to be broken by regular trains on British Rails. It was plagued with trying to do too many things at once and ultimately killed by politicians who had expected it too early (meaning it was rushed to market before it was ready) and then complained of its "greenness". Some of the patents, notably that for active tilting were later sold to Italy and used to develop a new class of Pendolino tilting trains that have been sold - to Great Britain among others.
</li></ul></li><li> Early models of a new-concept product such as a digital camera, being designed by-geeks-for-geeks, can sometimes have advanced features (foldout screens, own programming language) which get dropped in later models as the product goes mass-market. This can lead to howls of dismay from enthusiasts, who were expecting a new model to improve <em>everything</em>, only to find that a choice feature has been removed to save money or dumb-down the product for the average consumer.
</li><li> The Soviet WWII-era T-34 tank plays this trope straight, subverts it, and generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">zigzags</a> it ten ways to Friday. Initial prewar batches of it were more carefully built and better outfitted than the wartime construction, but the model 1940 variant with its petrol engine suffered various engine-related teething problems that made them difficult to use, quite unreliable and the maintenance hogs to boot.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8zq4g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8zq4g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8zq4g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The early air filters that basically failed to filter any air come to mind, as well as the transmission that required such force to switch that there was a popular joke about that T-34 drivers were easier to jump over than maneuver around &#151; due to the cramped space tankers <em>do</em> tend to be short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotExplainTheJoke">but the training made them so much wider</a>.</span> The model 1941 with the famous and reliable Kharkiv V-2 engine was brought into production and the T-34S variant with a three-man turret was tested as a prototype, but once the war started, the Soviets couldn't afford refitting the production lines to the T-34S variant. Wartime production models were incredibly rushed, crudely finished to the point of sometimes forgoing the <em>paint</em>, but the design itself was polished and improved. It didn't help that there were significant quality differences between the vehicles at different factories, with those from Factory 183 being the best and those from Factory 112 being notoriously unreliable. And then in the midst of a war the real Super Prototype tanks was designed, the T-43, which was a sort of answer to the Pz.V Panther and addressed all of the T-34 flaws than remained unsolved &#151; but the realities of the war time made sure that it never was mass-produced, because it still was inadequately armored and doing so would once again mean stopping the assembly lines for as much as a whole <em>month</em>, meaning some thousands of T-34 wont get to the frontline. Instead, all of its features that could be applied to the T-34 without stopping the production (like a new transmission and new variant of the V-2 engine) were transferred to the old workhorse model along with a new, three-man turret, resulting in the definitive T-34-85 model.
<ul><li> The T-100 was this to the KV series of tanks, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">double turrets for twice the fire power</a>. This made it restrictively top-heavy, and the weapon was eventually converted into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">more practical SPG</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Frequently happens in wartime with things that are going to be mass produced. A good example would be submachine guns. Both the Sten and MP-40 prototypes were carefully machined and had carved wooden furniture. When it came to the production models, the wood gave way to wire and the guns were made by anybody with the ability to bash metal.
</li><li> The MBT-70 was the direct precursor to the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Leopard II and M1 Abrams</a> main battle tanks, and for a while was technically superior to both. The catch? The fact that it required a practical PHD in engineering in order to operate meant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">only a select number of people could operate it</a>, and it certainly wasn't reasonable to devote a whole base of logistics for only a dozen tanks. The other problem was that the Germans and Americans at the time had incompatible ideas of what they wanted out their next main battle tank, which was why the American version of the MBT-70 carried a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">152mm rifled gun</a> that was also capable of launching missiles while the German version used a 120mm smoothbore gun that only fired shells. (In the end, both armies used the German gun for their later tanks, so if not for Pentagon stubbornness a further-developed and simplified MBT-70 probably would've worked out fine.)
</li><li> When the Russians in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOughts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOughts">The Oughts</a> decided to develop a new Main Battle Tank, they pulled out all stops, the final result being an object 195 (better known as T-95) prototype. With its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">6" cannon</a>, an unmanned turret, radar, the 30 mm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Anti-Air</a> gun and all high-tech gizmos the money could buy, it turned out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">too large, too heavy and, most important, too complex and expensive</a> to build more than a handful. Unsurprisingly, it was canceled in 2010, with most of its usable features migrating to a still very ambitious, but notably more reasonable object 148 (AKA T-14 Armata) MBT, first displayed in May 2015.
</li><li> The M-26E1 "Super Pershing" (It's even in the name!) fits this to a T. A new model with an upgraded gun the very first pilot model was rushed into battle straight from the factory late in the war amid continuing calls for tanks with still more firepower to battle the very heaviest German vehicles<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9tbsf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9tbsf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9tbsf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Stories about it having defeated a King Tiger in battle, while awesome, have been proven untrue by combat records.</span>. Only this single unit was ever deployed in combat however and was then further modified by its mechanics by having scavenged armor welded onto it to improve protection before being assigned to an elite crew.
</li><li> The one-of-a-kind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">WWII Japanese</a> <em>super</em> destroyer "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Shimakaze_(1942)">Shimakaze<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", armed with <em>15 torpedo tubes</em> and 6 5-inch guns plus a top speed of 42 knots thanks to an experimental engine. Being the most powerful destroyer in the world was useless against the air attack that sank her in 1944.
</li><li> The demos for some games can fall in this category, showing graphical effects not present in the final product. One example was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Watch_Dogs</a></em>, with rain and lighting effects shown in its E3 trailer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> of the PC version. Sometimes this is for sound technical reasons like causing performance problems on anything but a very specific combination of hardware or just using too much processor power for all but the most expensive kit to run acceptably, but sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> plays a part; in the case of the aforementioned <em>Watch_Dogs</em>, it's been alleged that the game was downgraded at the insistence of Sony and/or Microsoft because they didn't want to hurt console sales by having the PC version look better, as modders have successfully patched these effects back in and found them to work fine even on mid-range hardware.
</li><li> Pre-release versions of the Kinect, a camera accessory for the Xbox 360, included a relatively beefy built-in processor to handle its functions without taking resources away from game performance. The processor was stripped out at the last minute to reduce the cost, making the final version much less versatile.
</li><li> The US Navy's <em>Seawolf</em>-class nuclear attack submarine was originally meant to be a larger production run meant to replace the predecessor class in that role, the <em>Los Angeles</em>-class. Instead, only three were made. The <em>Virginia</em>-class, a more cost-effective (though not quite as capable) evolution of the <em>Seawolf</em>, is instead slated to replace the <em>Los Angeles</em> class and already has four times the number of the <em>Seawolf</em>, with many more planned.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Heckler &amp; Koch G11</a> is an experimental assault rifle which uses caseless ammunition, it has a slow full auto firing mode and an <em>absurdly quick and accurate</em> three round burst mode. It also looks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWeaponsWillBeBoxyInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWeaponsWillBeBoxyInTheFuture">boxy and futuristic</a> thanks to its unique loading mechanism. Unfortunately, despite being a huge success, the cost inefficiency has terminated its production.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CoolGuns/MachineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CoolGuns/MachineGuns">MG 34</a> was the predecessor to the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CoolGuns/MachineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CoolGuns/MachineGuns">MG 42</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10g3vp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10g3vp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10g3vp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not exactly a prototype but close enough in spirit</span>. The MG 34 featured both a sturdier construction than its successor and was capable of sustaining a higher rate of fire. It also had a innovative crescent double trigger that allows the user to change between firing semi and full auto without the need of a selector switch. The 34 was to expensive and time intensive to manufacture so Germany designed the easy to manufacture 42 to take its place.
</li><li> Even merchandise isn't immune to this trope. For example, a plush toy of the Hunter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> was made. Look up a picture of the Hunter, then look up the plush. Now, look up the more accurate and arguably more superior prototype of said plush.
<ul><li> Toys in general tend to go through this, as the prototypes that eventually get used as the basis for the production molds are handmade and consequently tend to feature better paint jobs and sharper details than the finished versions. This is especially common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, due to the complex engineering involved and the somewhat inconsistent budgets - for instance, compare the <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/b/b3/Leobreakerearly.jpg">prototype claw mode<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> of Leobreaker to that of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.unicron.us/tf2005/toypix/leobreaker3b.jpg">retail release<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. This overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a>, however, as they're made of resin and therefore quite fragile.
</li><li> When Jakks Pacific produced WWE figures, they were so well known for producing great prototypes for toy shows but cutting corners on the final release that it even had its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>, "Chinese New Year". This is in response to an infamous occurrence of cost-cutting in Adrenaline Series 13 wherein Jakks used leftover, barely articulated arms from their first series Titantron Live, which featured the only figure ever of Sylvain Grenier. Jakks employee Jeremy Padawer's asserted that the switch had happened because the employees in charge of producing the arms were away for Chinese New Year yet WWE wanted the company to keep to schedule.
</li></ul></li><li> The infamous Power Glove's original proof of concept, the Data Glove, functioned near perfectly and could do far more than the final product. The problem was the design was <em>way</em> too pricey to make to be profitable, and the designers only had five months to reduce the price to reasonable levels, resulting in the flawed final product.
</li><li> Occurs with videogame consoles where the prototype or launch models have features that are then scaled back on later versions, usually for cost reasons. The first PS3 consoles included backwards compatibility, but subsequent units lost this feature. Or how the first Xbox 360s featured internal hard drives, whereas later ones required a customer to spend more than $100 to buy their own separate Xbox hard drive.
</li><li> The Rocketdyne F-1 (the engine that powered the Saturn V rockets) to every U.S. rocket engine since then. It was so powerful that the first examples built, scaled up from existing rocket designs, were unable to stand up to the force they were delivering and literally ripped themselves apart on the test stand. To test their stabilizing capabilities, NASA essentially built a grenade launcher to fire explosives into the rocket plume while the engine was running. Each individual flying F-1 engine was hand-built and hand-tuned, making the whole production run of fifty engines a series of Super Prototypes designed to work with four other Super Prototypes in concert.
</li><li> The Super Foonly F-1, whose famous application was rendering the CG in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">TRON</a></em>, was the most powerful PDP-10 minicomputer ever made. However, only one was ever produced; DARPA withdrew funding for the project, and later computers produced by the Foonly company were slower and less efficient.
</li><li> The Empire State Building: When the ESB was built, it was much taller than any other skyscraper had been, and no one really knew just how strong it had to be to stay up. So they overbuilt it to such a degree that decades later, a Cessna crashed into one of the higher floors and people three floors above and below the crash site _didn't even notice_. (Later skyscrapers, having learned from its example, are much weaker and much cheaper to build.)
