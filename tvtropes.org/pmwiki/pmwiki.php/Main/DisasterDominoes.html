A giggling baby throws her cup at a blender, which throws its contents over the worktop. The spray from the blender hits a group of hanging pans, which fall off and take a shelf down with it. The cans on the shelf roll along the worktop as they fall, pushing a prepared chicken in a roasting tin right underneath a bag of flour, which falls on the edge of the tin and throws the chicken across the room.

Eventually, the camera cuts away from the mayhem to show this huge dust cloud over the city. Then it cuts away to the doctor's office, where the guy that caused the mess is being treated for multiple broken bones; his doctor walks in... and it turns out to be the pretty girl. The rest of the merchants in the bazaar are also in the waiting room. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65C-rnKSXXM">See it here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> In one of The Discovery Channel's "Know More Than You Should" ads, a woman witnesses a squirrel run out into the street. She remarks to a coworker, "Great, now there'll be cats everywhere." Her coworker gives her a funny look, but as she predicted, a car swerves to avoid the squirrel, a truck swerves to avoid the car and tips over. Said truck was a tank-truck full of milk, and as milk pours out onto the street, hundreds of cats arrive to lap it up.

Or, taken even further back, the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima could be the first domino. The news report on the bomb prompted his father, a watchmaker who had been training his son to follow in his footsteps, to instead push his son into a career in nuclear physics. Which results in Jon meeting said girlfriend at his first job after getting his PhD and in him volunteering to fix her watch when it is broken using the skills his father taught him as a young man.

</li><li> DC villain Major Disaster had this as an actual power after a deal with the demon Neron in the Underworld Unleashed event. In Flash #125, he throws a sandwich into the street, causing a dog to chase it, the dog's owner spills her bag of apples, a bicyclist falls off his bike from hitting the apples, the bike hits a man on the other side of the street and scatters the papers he's carrying, and the papers fly into the windshield of a bus, which swerves and kills the bus passenger who has been annoying Disaster for hours.

One such event results in an group of E88 villains, including both Kaiser and Hookwolf, getting hammered by a 1-tonne block of blue ice.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g4qz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0g4qz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g4qz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A storm in Miami causes a refrigeration facility storing in-flight meals to turn off for a few hours, before resetting, thus leading to no-one noticing. These meals were then served on flight from Miami to Portland. Improper storage causes the passengers to suffer food poisoning, requiring them to use the toilets. This fills the plane septic tanks. The flight run into the same storm that caused the power outage. Due to turbulence, a hairline fracture in the tanks is caused and a leak is formed. To avoid this turbulence, the plane increases altitude and blue ice forms, causing problems with flight balance, making the plane want to climb. This leads to the plane deviating from the flight plan and decreasing altitude again. The warmer air at lower altitude thaws the blue ice just enough to make it drop off the plane - on a perfect trajectory onto the storage building where the Empire is holding Taylor hostage.</span> Taylors power is practically weaponizing the trope, and as the power isn't under conscious control, it doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>. If the Empire had just let things be and accepted that their plan had failed, nothing would have happened. They decided to act as, well, the Empire.

<ul><li> <em>Anything</em> written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a>. The plot of a typical Crichton novel starts with a bad decision, which is then compounded by additional people making bad decisions and/or minor technological glitches that just happen to be the <em>worst possible thing that could happen</em>.
</li><li> Played straight in Bernard Werber's "The Thanatonauts", in which the angels use a rat to engineer a series of events, eventually leading to a plane crashing into the main characters' apartment building, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">killing them all</a>.
</li><li> Done with a series of mummified relics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nation">Nation</a></em>. The main characters flee the cloud of noxious dust that is quickly filling the cave, stopping halfway because there's a gap in the mummies and they think the chain will stop... until a flying rib manages to score a perfect hit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em> introduces a Soviet submarine, with an overworked technician failing to notice that one gauge is a bit too high. Ten pages later, a sphere of molten metal has destroyed the sub. Worse than that: he <em>noticed</em> the gauge was a bit too high, but he was prevented from fixing it by the urgency of their mission. The book then goes into detail about how, to save money, the Soviet Navy used steel instead of titanium for a small "flapper" valve which, when subjected to the hot radioactive water of the nuclear power plant cooling system, warped ever so slightly, causing small "waves" in the cooling pipe water. These waves grew larger and larger over time until eventually the system, not designed to deal with the pressure variation, sprung a leak. This then results in the reactor going critical, melting down, and every single person on the submarine dying from either drowning or asphyxiation. Because of a ten-cent savings in metal costs. As if that's not bad enough, the US then uses the sunken submarine to steal the Soviet Navy's highly advanced and extremely expensive new missile submarine. So really, because of a ten-cent savings in metal costs, the Soviet Navy loses the <em>Red October</em>.

All because he fell for a Mimbrate girl and was forced to elope. On the plus side, he <em>did</em> get the girl. This is implied to happen rather frequently in Arendia, always ending in war. Garion notes that this is tragically typical of Lelldorin.

Jianzhu was the previous Avatar's (Kuruk) earthbending teacher. Kuruk died at the very young age of 33 and left a power vacuum in his wake, only exasperated by the fact that the search for the Earth Kingdom Avatar dragged on and on for about fifteen years. He and his friend Kelsang (Kuruk's Airbending teacher) ultimately happen upon a kid named Yun hustling adults at pai sho using Kuruk's outside the box strategy and decide he's the Avatar. They train him for two years to no avail only to find out that Kyoshi is actually the Avatar. Kyoshi worked in the compound where they were training Yun who became one of her best friends and Kelsang was her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>.

In order to get them off his back, he concocts a poison that kills a bunch of people and almost kills his last true ally, Hei-ran (Kuruk's firebending teacher). The novel goes out of its way to point that while Jianzhu is guilty, his mistakes have piled up on him and are taking their toll on him. By the time he and Kyoshi have their final showdown, he's a complete wreck.
</li><li> The West African folk tale "Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears" (which the page quote is from) tells the tail of Mosquito, who tells a lie to an iguana and sets off a chain of events that results in one of Mother Owl's children being killed, and thus she refused to wake the sun so the day would come until she knew who was responsible.
</li><li> Similarly, there's the Western "The Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly", which couples this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Serial Escalation</a> (she ate a spider to catch the fly, a mouse to catch the spider, etc.), until finally dying from eating a horse.

The captain of an aircraft carrier sailing into Hong Kong harbor orders a midshipman to "let go" of a signal flag. The first officer overhears and "let's go" the starboard anchor. Through a comedy of errors, this inexorably leads to the loss of multiple ships, aircraft, seabirds, and the goodwill of the city of Hong Kong.

The Plague initially only destroyed a few space stations, but the destruction of the stations spawned more debris which took out further stations, creating even more debris which took out more stations, recursively, creating Kessler Syndrome (see Real Life). When the Glitter Belt is shown ~10 years later in <em>Chasm City</em>, it has been reduced to a few dozen aging enclaves in the so-called "Rust Belt", with the lower orbits clogged with debris that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Banshees</a> use as cover.

This is made even worse by the fact that she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">city-destroying monstrosity</a> who broadcasts a psychic scream across geographic distances whenever she attacks, creating potentially hundreds of thousands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">sleeper agents</a>.

He couldn't control this ability, and usually didn't even begin the specific chain of events.

He meticulously schedules both the cleaning and his usual Sunday "to do" list of planning the neighbourhood's group social activities, but his lack of housework experience means things soon go wrong: He overloads the washing machine, and when he hears it jolting across the kitchen floor, he takes his eyes off a carpet shampooer for just long enough for it to swamp the entire hallway with foam. As he tries feebly to clean up the foam with a dustpan and brush, he stops paying attention to the absurdly large amount of rice he is boiling for his lunch, which soon covers half the top of the cooker. His attempts to vacuum up the rice lead to the vacuum cleaner breaking, and when he tries putting the remaining rice down the kitchen sink, it quickly becomes clogged. Finally, his nerves completely frayed thanks to both the housework chaos and a neighbour who won't stop calling him with questions about forthcoming social activities, he throws a porkchop into a plastic tub and puts it in the oven to cook for dinner; the melting plastic soon fills the entire kitchen with smoke, and the oven is ruined.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AirCrashInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AirCrashInvestigation">Air Crash Investigation</a></em>: It's basically one long sequence of these. For example, <em>Crash of the Century</em> (the story of the Tenerife disaster of 1977; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section for details) has the dominoes from lack of ground radar, an overloaded airport, bad communication, foggy weather and a captain too eager to take off.
</li><li> Frank Spencer (Michael Crawford) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SomeMothersDoAveEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SomeMothersDoAveEm">Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em</a></em> is one of British television's great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea">Walking Disaster Areas</a>, and had a flair for setting off disaster dominoes. Perhaps the crowning example is the 1973 episode "Have a Break, Take a Husband", in which he starts by tearing a hole in the cheap linoleum of the hotel room in which he and his wife Betty are staying for their second honeymoon. By the end of the episode, through a combination of his own ineptitude and the room's shoddy construction, he has torn a floor mat in half, broken several drawers apart, broken the door off the wardrobe, smashed a hole through the floor in the middle of the room, convinced a nervous fellow guest that his dead grandfather is trying to contact him, put two more holes in the floor under the bed, ripped the washbasin from the wall, and demolished the hotel bar.
</li><li> On the episode "Arrhythmia" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlmostHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlmostHuman">Almost Human</a></em>, a former police DRN unit riding with Kennex and Dorian jumps out of Kennex's car to arrest a man he thinks is a fugitive. This results in an SUV rolling forward down a hill and smashing into a parked car which hits a fire hydrant which is blown into the air and hits a police drone which is damaged and thrown out of control, ricocheting off a building and smashing into a police android who is stopped nearby writing a ticket and carrying him through the door of a third vehicle. Kennex and Dorian watch the entire thing unable to say anything.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorInTheHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorInTheHouse">Doctor in the House</a></em> franchise featured numerous examples over the years, but perhaps the most noteworthy happens in the climax of "Honeymoon Special" from <em>Doctor in Charge</em>. Drs. Stuart-Clark and Collier put Dr. Bingham's leg in plaster as a prank before he leaves on his honeymoon, and Dr. Waring is forced to drive Bingham and his wife to their honeymoon hotel in a hired car and then stay the night; when the prank is revealed, he forces Collier to come to the hotel with a set of plaster cutters. Collier nearly misses the turn for the hotel, and reverses his car into a ditch as he tries to correct his mistake. As he forgets the plaster cutters in the car, the other doctors try to pull it out with Bingham driving the hired car, but his plastered foot gets stuck on the accelerator, dragging both cars on a wild ride down country roads and stopping on a level crossing &mdash; just as the barriers lower for an oncoming train. A mad scramble ensues to get the cars off the crossing in time, but then the still plaster-encased Bingham gets his foot stuck under the rails... fortunately, the train is going in the other direction and he is unharmed. (Collier's car gets front-ended by the other car, however, and his leg really does get broken in the impact.)

Viewers are generally in agreement that Walter's actions indirectly led to the plane crash, but opinions are sharply divided on whether it's appropriate to actually blame him for the crash (which the show appears to).

</li><li> "Seasons of Fear" has him undermining an invincible roman for thousands of years while he slowly goes insane from having the Doctor show up at his every moment of triumph to stop him until at the end, he is accidentally thrown back in time and his younger self is horrified and the entire story is rendered moot, the disaster dominoes coming from this being the distortion in time that allows beings made up of the erased possibilities and distortions of the timeline to invade the normal timeline and eventually breaks the universe that started with the first story in the series. Oops.

During her second appearance, a trio of other metas are about to attack her. She tells them "good <em>luck</em> with that" and activates her power. Here's the sequence: a rat runs across a prison yard control panel, activating a spotlight; the light blinds Mina, causing her to lose control of the metal eagle she's sending at Becky; the eagle smashes into Rundine, who is send flying at a bench press; the overturned weights knock out Ramsey Deacon. Just then, Amunet shows up. Becky starts another chain: Amunet lowers the rifle of a guard; the guard accidentally fires a gas grenade at her feet; Amunet starts feeling the effects of the gas and falls, while spinning and accidentally firing her metal shards, killing all of the guards.

<ul><li> In a general example, as a live band, there are four situations that qualify as Disaster Dominoes for a live band &mdash; in that they produce a cascading series of failures and are nigh-impossible to stop without stopping the song and either starting over (a <em>huge</em> faux pas that calls your professionalism into question, and is almost only forgivable in the case of massive technical problems or danger to life/health) or picking up where things went so pear-shaped it had to stop.
<ul><li> The first: the drummer is off rhythm. Unless the bassist or rhythm guitarist realize what's going on and try to get the drummer back into the groove or give up on him or her entirely and try to up their volume to cover it, both will proceed to go off rhythm as well, leaving the lead and singer to try to keep up to something entirely different than what they've rehearsed, and usually very badly failing at it.
</li><li> The second: an intro solo (usually guitar or bass) is very badly botched. Unless the singer is relying on a cue other than a point in that solo or a note on teleprompter or notes, he or she <em>will</em> come in at the wrong place and either singing too fast or too slow to avoid dead air. The guitarist(s) will then usually try to start compensating for the singer and getting the song back on track, only making the problem <em>worse</em> when they and the bass speed up to an already out of breath singer and go out of tempo with the drums. An experienced drummer <em>might</em> stop the cascade of failure by keeping his original rhythm, though this itself will make the song sound awful until they reach a break. An <em>inexperienced</em> one will go faster himself.
</li><li> The third: The soundboard guy sucks, and therefore everyone's playing does. This is often the one that is an exception to starting over being seen as unprofessional, and has occasionally led to bands <em>walking out</em> on the show or demanding no live adjustments (e.g. demanding the soundboard guy set to their/their tour manager's specs and <em>leave it alone</em>)
</li><li> The fourth: a major technical failure or someone's out sick, specifically for the drummer, the lead guitarist, or the singer. A band can play without bass (though it will sound worse) or without a rhythm guitar (there's many bands that don't have one to begin with), but the drums or lead guitar or vocals not being there will often lead to everything related to the performance collapsing, unless it's a <em>very</em> experienced band that can rework their music on the fly to work as drumless or instrumental.

The wife calls up her sister and asks her to come over to comfort her, which gives her boyfriend time to go out and get a beer from a nearby store. He leaves the keys in his car, allowing some teenagers to take a joyride in his car.

<ul><li> Extremely common in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense">Tower Defense</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseGridTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseGridTheAwakening">Defense Grid: The Awakening</a></em> and its sequel. In <em>Defense Grid</em> enemies are aiming to steal power cores from your core housing and escape with them rather than destroying the object you're trying to protect like in most TD games. When you kill an enemy it drops the core it's carrying, which will slowly float back towards the housing again, unless another enemy picks it up again. The most common way to lose cores is for an enemy to grab some and head back out the way it came in, passing through another incoming wave of fresh enemies as it does so. Even if your towers pick off the core carrier (as they're programmed to do automatically), this will just result in the core being passed over to a new, fresh enemy, possibly an even tougher one than the one that initially grabbed it (particularly annoying when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> like a Racer passes a core to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> like a Crasher). And of course, the new carrier can pass the core on <em>again</em> to <em>another</em> wave, resulting in a core changing hands in a relay all the way back to the enemy entrance zone, where it's lost for good. If you let a core get taken far enough from the housing and your Grid isn't strong enough to eliminate the enemies as soon as they come onto the field, the core is as good as lost.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19gx8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19gx8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19gx8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This happens a lot less on levels which have a separate exit on the other side of the core housing, rather than sending enemies back to their entrance point.</span>

</li><li> This is a common strategy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>; get one enemy to shoot another, often by strafing/streaking through, and next thing you know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetAMookToKillAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetAMookToKillAMook">they're fighting each other.</a>
</li><li> Your inevitable fate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>.
<ul><li> A "tantrum spiral" is what happens when one unhappy dwarf finally tips over the edge and ends up setting off other unhappy dwarves. Dwarf A doesn't get enough sleep one night, goes on a rampage, and cuts Dwarf B's wife in half. Dwarf B finds out his wife is dead, goes mad with grief, and smashes a statue Dwarf C rather liked. Dwarf C finds out about the statue, and you can see where this is going. For many players, this is part of the appeal of the game.
</li><li> See the saga of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Boatmurdered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Boatmurdered">Boatmurdered</a>, an epic tale of mismanagement and bloody death which ends with legendary former leaders beating dwarves to death while on fire and the inferno causes the entire fortress to devolve into a massive flaming brawl while the flaming corpse of a monarch butterfly wedges open the front gates and keeps the Doomsday Device from being activated.
</li></ul></li><li> This can occur in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>.
<ul><li> After you've killed your first dragon as part of the main quest, at any point you're wandering around Skyrim, another dragon might swoop down on you, even if you're currently fighting something else. Dragons are also smart enough to skirmish with you, then fly over and antagonize some other enemy, and try to lead that threat over to you. Each area in the game has a chance for a random encounter to trigger, such as a patrol of bandits, soldiers or Thalmor, while several areas feature bandit camps or army outposts, which might be hostile to you as well. <em>And</em> depending on a player's behavior, a Hold's guard force might get involved in one of these clusterfucks and then attempt to arrest you as soon as the fighting is over.
</li><li> In Markarth, the Dragonborn gets involved in a conspiracy that could very well end with a prison riot and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">Forsworn</a> carving a bloody path across the city, killing an important nobleman in the process. Depending on the order in which the player completed the quests and visited cities, it all started with the Dragonborn getting into a drinking contest with a stranger in a tavern on the other side of the province. In fact, since Markarth is so far away from the player's start location, it's more likely, perhaps even <em>expected</em>, to get involved with the conspiracy that way.
</li></ul></li><li> Kessler Syndrome (see Real Life) appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessSpace">Endless Space</a></em> as one of the most potent negative anomalies that can affect a planet. Many planets are host to the remains of long dead civilizations, and Kessler Syndrome is the result of a space-faring civilization dying back without taking their satellites with them, causing derelict satellites to smash into each other, generating debris which smashes into more satellite ad infinitum, turning the low and high orbits into rings of lethal debris, making space travel dangerous and expensive.
</li><li> In the game, <em>Eric the Unready</em>, the titular protagonist manages to set off one of these during a banquet, burning down the entire building.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> Can be a frequent occurrence in the series. A stray bullet can graze an innocent bystander who then returns fire, he misses and grazes <em>another</em> bystander. It's sometimes an option to avoid conflict by letting a town kill itself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> alone, the abandoned cars are nuclear powered, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">explode if damaged</a>, and there may be strings of them on the ruined roads, ready to set each other off. It's a highly entertaining way to kill enemies, just be careful you're a good distance away from the fun.
</li><li> One trap in <em>Fallout 3</em> uses a row of boxes set up like dominoes to start a chain reaction. Battering ram hits domino boxes, last domino triggers pitching machine which knocks fire extinguisher into bear trap, setting off grenades and gas explosions that will kill the player if they're in the wrong place.
</li><li> Antagonize a member of a faction (by petty theft, trespassing, pickpocketing) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, turning them hostile, kill them in self-defense, causing infamy to be gained and other nearby members to attack you, until your reputation hits bottom and they are permanently shot at on sight. Even if you are only "shunned" by the NCR or Legion, they will send hit squads after you, and killing these will completely destroy your standing with them.
</li><li> In the Nellis generator facility, the ants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">explode</a> when killed with certain weapons. If set off next to one of the stored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrels">howitzer shells</a>, they may cause a chain reaction of detonations that blows you and your companions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">to smithereens</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The goal of many levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIncredibleMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIncredibleMachine">The Incredible Machine</a></em> is to place the last missing domino for this to happen.
</li><li> Every event that takes place in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> game is sparked by the Exile's return to known space. The Sith come out of hiding to capture her, destroying Peragus in the process, the restoration efforts on Telos depends on the fuel from Peragus, and all other planets devastated by the Jedi Civil War depend on Telos to set the example that it can be done. If Telos fails, then the Republic will have bankrupted itself in the attempt with no result and will collapse. The ripple effect of the consequences of even a small act, in fact, is one of the themes of the game.
</li><li> The climactic scene of the text adventure, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeatherGoddessesOfPhobos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeatherGoddessesOfPhobos">Leather Goddesses of Phobos</a></em>, features Trent (or Tiffany) deploying the Anti-Leather Goddesses Attack Machine, which works in this way.
</li><li> Spectacular failures in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> can often be traced back to a single event, most likely a Boomer vomiting on all four survivors at once. On harder difficulties the AI director seems to play up the smallest mistakes into really, really big and tragic messes. One stray bullet hitting a car, alerting the horde, and wouldn't you know it, a Boomer spawns 15 seconds later, which is almost impossible to avoid since the players are already getting swarmed. Inevitably, one or two will be dead, the remainder near death, and no medpacks to be found... wait, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">what's that</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">rumbling noise</a>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoStarWars">LEGO Star Wars</a></em>. Vader gets a medal this time as he's won the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>. An entire legion of Stormtroopers are lined up on the steps, so Vader gives on of them a hearty slap on the back, sending the lego figures toppling like dominoes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome: Total War</a></em>'s <em>Barbarian Invasion</em> expansion has this as a core mechanic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">"Horde"</a> factions are distinct from normal factions in that losing their last city doesn't eliminate them from the game, instead they spawn several armies that can proceed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> other cities to their hearts' content, or conquer a territory and declare it their new homeland. The Huns and Vandals start out in horde form, right next to the Sarmatians, Roxolani, Goths, Burgundii, Lombardii, and Franks, all of whom are horde factions themselves. So just like the real-life Migration Period the game is set in, it's common for one barbarian faction to uproot another, who in turn goes looking for new lands at the expense of their neighbors.
</li><li> Many of the deaths in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScorchedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScorchedEarth">Scorched Earth</a></em> and other tank games can cause a cascading ladder of death from a single kill.
</li><li> When Crowe comes back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Saisei-hen</a></em>, the first thing that happens is that he gets a debt of a few thousand dollars because of a highway accident which then turned into a <em>million dollars</em> worth of debt. By the end of the game, he's not even <em>close</em> to paying off those debts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:

</li><li> Some raid bosses such as Archimonde and Anub'Rekhan are based around this; something bad happens whenever a character dies, which may end up killing another, then another two, then... And in a more literal "dominoes" sense, there are a few raid bosses, such as Kel'thuzad in Naxxramas, who have attacks that can "jump" from player to player. One player makes the wrong move at the wrong time and everyone can quickly end up dead from the chain reaction.
</li><li> The Lich King. One of his attacks, called Defile, targets a player to create a black puddle at his feet. Every tick of damage it does, it grows a bit larger in radius. If a player gets caught as it grows, it keeps growing. If another player who had cleared the danger radius stopped just short of the edge, it gets caught again, taking more damage, growing it a bit more. All it takes is two players doing this two step forward cha-cha a couple of times, and the puddle soon covers the entire playfield, wiping out the raid. Throughout all this, his valkyrs will pick three random players and drag them to the edge to drop them over, and they cannot do anything until the other players kill the valkyr (preferably <em>before</em> being their helpless ally is dropped over the edge). If one or more players get dropped, there will be fewer players for the next wave of valkyrs, who will more easily throw more off the edge, and so on, until the wipe is inevitable.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the physics involved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms">Worms</a></em>, a single shot can result in a chain reaction of explosions from mines, oil barrels, crates being torched by the aforementioned items, dying worms self-destructing, and so on. This can contain equal amounts of awesome, fail, and hilarity, as any veteran Worms player will attest to. Quite often entire island formations and reduced into gutted, swiss-cheese-like shells of their original forms during the process. For extra points, sometimes this involves the worm who pulled the trigger getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">caught up in the carnage that ensues</a>.
</li><li> Any with any strategy game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoraleMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoraleMechanic">morale</a> is a major issue, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a></em> is a good example. One of your soldiers dies, causing another to panic and drop his gun, leading to him dying as well, which causes a third guy to snap and start firing wildly, killing two of his allies, and next thing you know, your entire squad is wiped out without even engaging the enemy. Enemies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psionics</a> don't even need to raise their guns &mdash; a handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Panic Attacks</a> later, the squad that was assigned to fight them will end up killing itself for them through berserk firing of HE rounds and panicked dropping of primed explosives.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a></em>, in a vein similar to XCOM, if one of your party members experiences enough stress to get an Affliction, their erratic behaviour can spread Stress across the entire party, which in turn can push them to the breaking point and get an Affliction. With a full party of 4 Afflicted heroes, a single action &mdash; from friend or foe &mdash; can cause Stress to ripple through the party as everyone reacts with a Stress-inducing quip.

</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em>, the collapse of a project known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator">the Skyhole</a> caused a chain of these.
<ul><li> It effectively destroyed a great Clan, leaving a power gap that was eventually filled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Jaal'darya</a>.
</li><li> The area around the collapse was rendered next to uninhabitable thanks to the dust and debris.
</li><li> The collapse trapped many Sarghress troops on the surface and cut them off from the rest of Chel.
</li><li> Taking advantage of this, Diva'ratrika had the Sharen led by Sarv'swati attack the weakened Sarghress.
</li><li> This led directly to the battle where Sarv'swati fought Quain'tana <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and made her barren</span> which has <em>huge</em> effects on the main story.
</li><li> The Sarghress survived thanks to their cavalry making a forced march from the surface and coming to the rescue to their clanmates and Ill'haress just in time.
</li><li> The collapse and its after effects ruined the good will that had been building among the clans, setting the stage for the distrust and indifference that would later show itself in the Nidraa'chal War.
</li><li> The collapse also took many of Chel's most creative and progressive thinkers with it, and set back the colonization effort for many years.

Eliza saw a starving Lynch using a cactus needle which was ineffective, so she gave it a regular threading needle to help it eat its weight. She believed she was doing the right thing to help it eat. However, other birds came flocking to her for threading needles as well. She gave them all threading needles, and then set off a bigger calamity. It's not until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a> that she realizes that if Lynchs eat all the larvae, there are no flies to feed the next animal up in line, then there's nothing for them to be preyed on, and so the food chain falls apart.

The assistant at the yard quickly realizes that wasn't the correct way to set it up.

</li><li> Happens again in Episode 92, where Quack Quack drops a yogurt container which rolls into a tree, causing an apple to fall... this continues for about half the episode before it eventually launches a barrage of sharp weapons at Kaeloo, Stumpy and Mr. Cat, almost killing them.
