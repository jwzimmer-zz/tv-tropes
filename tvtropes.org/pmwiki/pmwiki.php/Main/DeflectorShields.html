</p><p>Most common around space ships, but also seen around bases and &mdash; very occasionally &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">individual people.</a>
</p><p>How much protection they offer is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">proportional to their power</a>. This also makes for yet another reason you are boned if the energy runs out. They may also be subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumOverload">Phlebotinum Overload</a> if they get hit by too many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">Energy Weapons</a>.
</p><p>An energy barrier can zap or repel anyone who touches it, or can simply behave like an impenetrable wall. It's often represented in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier">Beehive Barrier</a> or another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> construct. In practice, this is somewhat less scientifically feasible than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">Energy Weapons</a>, but not by much, at least in the way it is usually depicted &mdash; a strong electromagnetic field really can be used to deflect <a class="urllink" href="http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3x.html#particle">particle beam<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> weapons or railgun/coilgun slugs. A better example is the Earth's magnetic field which safeguards us from charged particles in the solar wind. NASA and ESA are actually researching how to reproduce the effect on future interplanetary spaceships, to protect Mars travelers from cosmic radiation.

The latter encourages certain maneuvers, such as making sure your shielded side is always facing the enemy.
</p><p>Shields are popular in fiction because it allows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> to participate in battles without the inconvenience of having to spend the rest of the episode making repairs to physical armor and systems. In older or lower-budget movies and TV, they also eliminate the need to show battle damage on the ship; e.g. having your Ensign call out "Shields down to twenty percent!" can be a lot cheaper than showing a gash blasted in your ship's armor. The downside is that creators often have to resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation">Explosive Instrumentation</a> to provide combat casualties on a shielded ship. In somewhat-harder science fiction, shields are useful to overcome the seemingly overwhelming attacker's advantage &mdash; cities on planets can't dodge, so if there isn't some way to defend against space-launched missiles and kinetic projectiles, wars are going to be short and boring.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValvraveTheLiberator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValvraveTheLiberator">Valvrave the Liberator</a></em>, Module 77 (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysonSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysonSphere">Dyson Sphere</a> structure our heroes live in) has mobile deflector shields, but they aren't large enough to defend the entire module-which is essentially a space city. Instead, they have to be moved like hand-held shields to block attacks.
</li><li> The sole reason <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> is still standing is due to Big O's impossibly sturdy arm plating which, over the course of the series, repels lasers, punches, swords, missiles, machine guns, and giant drills. The entire city gasps when his enemy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Alex Rosewater's robot, turns out to have a personal force field; the viewer is subsequently treated to a good five minute montage of Big O punching away uselessly from a variety of television sets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CombattlerV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CombattlerV">Combattler V</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase">Nanbara Connection</a> was protected with a semi-spherical energy shield. Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeasts</a> had a hard work breaking it, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> came up with plans to infiltrate into the place and disabling it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinger">Mazinger</a></em> series, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Photon Atomic Power Research Institute</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Fortress of Science</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase">Home Bases</a> were equipped with deflective, energy barriers that surrounded the whole building to repel the strikes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> and raids of enemy ships and airships. Unfortunately, a strong enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeast</a> could shatter the barrier by employing enough brute force, and the villains were smart enough to search and blow up the devices that made the barrier working.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>: The <em>Macross</em> gained a force field early in its mission. Atypically, for most of its journey, the field could not cover the entire ship, so crewmembers had to move three small shields around the ship to intercept enemy fire. Later, an "omnidirectional barrier" was invented, which overloaded when hit by too much fire, destroying an unnamed large city in Ontario. The <em>Macross</em> also uses focused pinpoint barriers to penetrate said shields, as a justification for space melee combat by kilometer tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> punching each other. Of particular note is that when the Omnidirectional Barrier overloads, the energy goes outwards, leaving the <em>Macross</em> itself unharmed at the center. This is terrible when hovering above a city full of civilians, but pretty darn useful when hovering inside the command base of a 4-million-ship enemy battle fleet.
</li><li> Later <em>Macross</em> installments have taken the pinpoint barrier idea and applied it to the series's trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">variable fighters</a>, combined with some degree of automation so that the pilot doesn't need to micromanage their placement.
</li><li> The Protoculture are shown to be have been able to project large-scale barriers without the overload problem the <em>Macross</em> had: both the Bird-Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em> and the battleship <em>Sigur Valens</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em> are shown to be capable of warping Fold Space to shield themselves from attack. In both cases, these shields could tank a tactical nuclear warhead without too much trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> The title spaceship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> has a Distorion Field that can deflect the lizards' gravity-based weapons along with more conventional attacks. The Jovians use the same technology, and the Nadesico crew eventually develop a special shield-piercing lance for their mechs. It should be noted that <em>Nadesico's</em> Distortion Fields actually <em>deflect</em> incoming fire. Enemy shots literally bounce off or curve around protected units.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> has the "Protect Shade" and upgraded "Protect Wall", which not just block beam-based attacks, but actually bend them into a pentagram before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">flinging it back at the attacker</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> has several types.
<ul><li> The most common one is the I-Field, which only protects against beam weapons, as all it does is make a cushion of particles that stops anything with less mass than the particles. They also made specialized versions to keep ships aloft in the air. Later, they developed the Beam Barrier/Beam Shield, which is basically a really wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blade</a> that could be used against physical attacks as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em>, the Nu Gundam can form an impenetrable, pyramid-shaped "Fin Funnel Barrier" with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Fin Funnels</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> has a variation: shields to keep weapons fire contained, during the Final Round matches of the Gundam Fight, thus allowing support teams and spectators to watch safely. There is one case of sabotage that forces one Gundam Fighter to serve as a shield in order to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectatorCasualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectatorCasualty">Spectator Casualties</a>. For the final Battle Royale, the entirety of the abandoned Lantau Island is sealed off by a force barrier, with only the competing Gundams on the island, though when the Devil Gundam makes its move, the support teams for our heroes work together with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Schwarz Bruder</a> to break through so Schwarz can help stop the Devil Gundam.
</li><li> The Mercurius Mobile Suit and Virgo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mobile Dolls</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> had Planet Defensors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drones</a> that generate a forcefield capable of blocking most ranged weapons. Their only weaknesses seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">lasers</a> and melee attacks, but this is usually offset by the Virgos' powerful beam cannons, their working in teams, and the rarity of weaponized lasers in the setting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny</a></em>, the Destroy, Destiny, Strike Freedom, and Legend Gundams, as well as the DOM Trooper, feature arm-mounted beam shield generators on both arms. The Infinite Justice has a single "Beam Carry Shield". The Mobile Armors Zamza-Zah and Gells-Ghe also carried these weapons, powerful enough to block a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> shot. The Akatsuki, with its Shiranui Space Pack, can form a pyramid-shaped barrier with its attack drones (in an homage to Nu Gundam's Fin Funnel Barrier).
</li><li> Earlier, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSEEDAstray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitGundamSEEDAstray">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray</a></em>, the Hyperion and Dreadnought Gundams have powerful barriers. The Hyperion could only use his for 5 minutes before his battery drained. Once its pilot gained the means to use infinite power, he ran with it.
</li><li> The Gundams from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> also field beam shield technology. Their GN fields were based on the particle density with a field that holds the particles in place. The GN field's strength is based entirely on how densely packed the particles are to deflect the oncoming projectile. The effect of it is largely made to dissipate and deflect beam attacks but a sufficiently powerful attack can either force its way through or completely overwhelm the field itself. However there are specifically weapons that were made to counter GN fields so while it protected against mostly everything, GN blades can still pierce through with minimum effort. The field itself was later weaponized by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Seravee</a>.

As noted in the <em>Mass Effect</em> entry below, kinetic barriers only stop physical ordinance, not energy weapons (like Reaper beams).

<ul><li> Ship shields, while capable of stopping physical impacts, work in sections, so a shield loss in one area means that the other areas are still protected. While this appears useful, it's also unhelpful when your bridge shield goes down and an A-wing manages to slip through your defensive fire and smash through your front window, and before anybody can react, your ship then smashes into a giant armored battlestation, killing your massive Super Star Destroyer in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">exceedingly embarrassing manner</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zlmb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0zlmb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zlmb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Just theoretically, you know.

</li><li> Ground-based shields can be bypassed by landing outside their protective radius and slowly walking under them. They serve to prevent your force from having the living bejeesus vaporized out of them by orbital bombardment. That forces the enemy into a land engagement which you usually have a better chance of winning &mdash; the scenario that took place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>. Unhelpfully,
</li><li> <em>Star Wars</em> canon has two kinds of shields &mdash; "energy" shields (a.k.a. ray shields) to repel energy blasts, and "particle" shields to repel physical objects. Shields consume a massive amount of energy, though, so if you're shielding something the size of a planet, you generally can only have one. This makes perfect sense in canon, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">a systematic failure to explain it at any point in the movies</a> left entire audiences going "What the hell?" when droids casually strolled through the shield that had just repelled tank fire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>. The confusion, and the length of the above explanation, also explain why so many writers prefer to just make their shields magical barriers that just <em>work</em>.
</li><li> The design of Coruscant's shields were two layers of energy/particle shields composed of hexagonal sections. At any given time both layers would have some number of open hexagons so the constant space traffic could continue while leaving the planet absurdly well protected. This makes Coruscant almost impervious to direct attack... as long as the shields can remain up. The energy requirements are astronomical, though, which has been a factor every time Coruscant is successfully invaded. The efficacy of this system fluctuates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
</li><li> <em>Star Wars</em> ship shields seem relatively effective on larger ships (anything from the size of the Millenium Falcon up) but strangely useless on fighters. The rebel fighters (X-wings et al) have deflector shields which supposedly gives them an advantage over the unshielded TIE fighters the Empire uses but in practice X-wings are just as vulnerable. While Luke survives a couple of hits in his X-wing, neither of them hit a vital area and the single hit Wedge takes damages his ship to the point he has to pull out of the trench run. This is averted in most video game adaptations though &mdash; rebel fighters have effective shields in those.

It surrounds the planet with only one orbital station used as door to allow ship traffic. Several X-wings manage to slip past to attack the forces on the ground before the shield door is closed, but when it does a pair of fighters can't recover in time and smashes against it. The shield also stops transmissions (except for minimal ones using a dedicated imperial channel), which is why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Rebels need to destroy the orbital station and bring down the shield before the Rogue One team on Scarif can transmit the Death Star plans to the ships above</span>.

Humanity ultimately wins by uploading a computer virus to the mothership that disables the shields, then nuking the mothership before they can correct the problem.

In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> universe, shields struck with lasguns produces a nuclear explosion (at both the shield end and the lasgun end) and nuclear weapons are forbidden at the cost of having all the Great Houses turn against you and the Spacing Guild revoke your ability to travel.

<ul><li> Frank Herbert's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> had both personal and ship-sized force fields that were good against fast-moving objects, but could be penetrated by slow-moving ones, could be brought down with a sufficient overload, and which exploded violently if struck by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">laser</a> &mdash; and so did the laser, so it wasn't a useful offensive effect unless the shooter was suicidal or used an automated gun. Which still isn't terribly helpful as it would immediately incur the wrath of the Great Houses for using nuclear-like weapons and the Spacing Guild revokes your ability to travel. <br><br>An interesting effect of the lasgun/shield interaction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> is that the explosive power is random: a weak lasgun and shield may produce a giant explosion while a strong lasgun and shield may only destroy themselves. Used to great tactical advantage in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChapterhouseDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChapterhouseDune">later books</a>, where unmanned shield projectors were placed on the battlefield as booby traps. <br><br>Anyway, the whole point of having the shields work that way was so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">we could still have sword fights in a laser-gun-technology society</a>. Hence the special fighting style where thin blades are slowed just before contact. They were also dangerous to use on Arrakis, as the shield oscillations drove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">Sand Worms</a> into a frenzy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoteInGodsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoteInGodsEye">The Mote in God's Eye</a></em> has one called the Langston Field, but Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle go into minute detail about how it works in a story collected in <em>N-space</em>. This includes them claiming that they came up with how that technology worked and then wrote the story around those limitations. Gets around the above-mentioned Newtonian problem by draining energy from anything incoming. Energy beams are weakened, and projectiles lose kinetic energy and slow down. (Note that this makes the Field a zone around the ship rather than a thin bubble or wall.) The Field absorbs the drained energy, then gradually radiates it outward as heat&mdash;unless it absorbs too much energy, in which case it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumOverload">collapses</a>, radiating all the stored energy inward <em>and</em> outward at once, destroying the shielded ship.
</li><li> Appears in Neal Asher's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePolity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePolity">The Polity</a></em> novels, where they are called "Hard Fields". Unlike most representations of Force Fields, hard fields do not protect against physical force without cost, but instead transfer all the force to the shield generator- hopefully located well away from whatever the field is protecting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan">Perry Rhodan</a></em> has featured a large variety of protective energy fields over the course of the series, quite a few of which were never really explained in detail, but the three 'classic' types used on Galactic ships for centuries are:
<ul><li> Your basic garden-variety "conventional" shield, which effectively acts as an invisible wall &mdash; the safest type to use if you're worried about civilians walking right into it.
</li><li> "High-energy" shields which differ from the above by, aside from having more stopping power, also extending into the fifth dimension, thereby preventing inconvenient teleporters or fusion bombs delivered by the ubiquitous transform cannons from simply popping into existence right <em>inside</em> your ship.
</li><li> And the paratron shield, which effectively displaces everything hitting it into hyperspace. Since hyperspace in this setting isn't a place where unprotected objects can exist for long, this generally means that such things either end up in a random alternate universe with usually no way back (if they're lucky) or cease to be altogether.
</li><li> Most of these shields follow the above rules&mdash;they can be broken down by concentrated fire, often from several attackers combining their efforts, and ships running out of energy&mdash;rarely though that happens&mdash;are in major problems. However, on occasion there are also shields that in normal deployment use very little energy and drain all further energy from the attacks they're shielding against, meaning that you only strengthen the shields with prolonged attacks.
</li><li> As a final point, the series also features literal "deflector fields"... which actually aren't this trope at all, but rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice">Cloaking Devices</a> working for the most part in the visible spectrum (they get their name from the way they 'deflect' light around who- or whatever wants to remain invisible). They're seen most often on the personal scale, but <em>can</em> in principle be used to hide larger objects as well; it's just not normally worth the bother because somebody actively looking for those will likely not rely on optical sensors alone anyway and the energy of the field itself is quite detectable.
</li></ul></li><li> Also from the mind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>: his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">Known Space</a></em> series features a "stasis field" &mdash; though not technically a "deflector", since it was a field in which no time passes &mdash; that can be used for everything from creating a knife (his "variable-sword" is a monofilament cord encased in a stasis field) &mdash; to shielding a ship or spacesuit (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldOfPtavvs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldOfPtavvs">World of Ptavvs</a></em>). Larry Niven himself once stated that it got to the point where he had to find reasons <em>not</em> to use a stasis field as a solution for everything.
</li><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The "shields" (referred to as "walls" and "bands" in the novels) actually have a logical basis, given the way they are described to work. The ships have gravity drives; the effect of the drives manifests itself on the "top" and the "bottom" of the ships (called "bands" to differentiate them from the other "walls") &mdash; where the effect is impenetrable. All ships above pinnace size also have "sidewalls" &mdash; also areas of focused gravity, though not as strong as the top or bottom walls. A strong enough energy blast can penetrate the sidewalls, though with distortion and a lessening of power &mdash; the bows and sterns of the ships are unshielded. Or at least were, until the protagonist's star nation develops "bow-walls". Tactics involves using enough missiles to get past the defenses of the opposing ships and letting loose with nuclear-bomb-pumped lasers. This is all a complicated rationale to have Napoleonic style fleet battles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace">IN SPACE!</a>.
</li><li> There are also particle shields, which are just what they sound like: energy fields to deflect particles when traveling at relativistic speeds. Civilian grade particle shielding can protect a ship up to .6c, while military grade shielding protects up to .8c. These are generated by the drive systems, so missiles that go ballistic when their drives are out (they either burn out or idle for a while to extend range) can be destroyed by debris and dust if left to coast for too long.
</li></ul></li><li> Shields in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireFromTheAshes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EmpireFromTheAshes">Empire from the Ashes</a></em> trilogy can block things traveling in hyperspace (like hypermissiles), but hyperspace consists of multiple "bands" that the overall shield strength (a huge energy drain) must be distributed among. Imperial shields consist of one or two solid layers that encompass the ship; if a layer pops, though, the entire ship becomes completely vulnerable. The Achuultani use a number of interlocking and overlapping discs, trading overall strength for redundancy.
</li><li> Force fields exist in the Eric Nylund novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfUniverse">A Game of Universe</a></em>, but they don't seem to be widely used: they've got something better. This is a Magitek universe, so starships have "protective circles": <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic">Geometric Magic</a> instead of shields. They still work the same, with the protective circle being drained by attacks and having to be recharged (somehow) over time.
</li><li> In the <em>Tomorrow War</em> (rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">"hard"</a> 'verse) by Alexander Zorich, shields are useful against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">rays</a>, but not kinetic weapons, which of course makes latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">just better</a>. Attempts to strap shields on a aerospace fighter the first time was one of the first book's plot lines, mainly on account of trying to make it work in an atmosphere &mdash; apparently, it was "solid" enough to mess up aerodynamics, but not enough to be used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> element.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bolo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bolo">Bolo</a></em> series gives the title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">supertanks</a> "Battlescreens". Being military sci-fi, their effects are quite important and are gone into at length: they stop physical impacts cold, destroying the projectiles, but can only weaken energy weapons, drawing off some of the beam power to top up the Bolo's own energy reserves. Various minor details suggest they are actually extremely powerful magnetic fields.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeHaldeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeHaldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar">The Forever War</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Stasis Field". Only problem is that nothing inside can go faster than 16.3 m/s, rendering most projectile and ray weapons useless, and any living thing not wearing special armor dies instantly when inside of it. Which means that inside of the field, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight">Sword Fight</a>.
</li><li> See also the double-layer spacedust repelling field the ships use to enable them to move at relativistic speeds without having to worry about running into much.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Heart of Gold" out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> books has a shield at least one inch thick. A Vogon attack with a dozen 30-megahurt cannon just pounds away at it, presumably trying to get through via brute force.
</li><li> Verner Vinge's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AcrossRealtime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AcrossRealtime">Across Realtime</a></em> books involve a technology akin to Larry Niven's stasis field, called a bobble, which creates a spherical area of stopped time. While the bobble is active, anything inside it is completely unaffected by anything that may happen in the outside universe. The consequences of this technology are essentially the plot of the novels.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em> series The Amazing Bubbles absorbs energy and stores it in her body as fat. She can then release it through bubbles at extremely high velocities. This power makes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a>, even to the extent of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">absorbing a nuclear blast, though she ends up comatose and massively overweight for a long time as a result.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> at least big colony ships has shields elastic and &mdash; <em>large</em> &mdash; enough to bounce away objects at typical meteor speed without turning them to fine dust. However, they have destructive mode as well, just set in deflection mode as more resource saving and obviously safer for shuttles.
</li><li> Spacecraft in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith">E. E. &#147;Doc&#148; Smith</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> universe were protected by "Battle Screens" that glowed with higher and higher colors of blackbody radiation as they absorbed energy, turning black when they were at last overcome. There were personal shields too. Like the shields in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a>, their resistance increased in proportion to the velocity of the impinging object, which was why Valerian space axes were so common (at the end of <em>Galactic Patrol</em>, Kinnison overcame the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s shields by using a machine gun that fired heavy, relatively low-speed bullets). An important point of difference from TV shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> is that Lensman universe ships usually have <em>at least</em> two layers of shields, PLUS a further layer more or less integral with the outer skin of the ship ("wall-shield"), which is tougher than the others. There is also a separate meteorite screen, which is basically a globular tractor beam with polarity reversed, but its usefulness against deliberate attack is essentially zero. (Actually Star Trek has all of those as well, primary and secondary shielding, structural integrity fields, navigational deflectors, which also protect against lasers.)

The drawback is that it runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">a mineral called Byzantium</a> which is either A) Ridiculously inaccessible to mine, B) Already mined by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">USSR</a>, or C) Mined decades ago and then sunk with the <em>RMS Titanic</em>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a></em> series' shield technology relies on manipulation of spacetime to bend incoming ordnance back in on itself. This destroys missiles outright and deflects kinetic and beam weapons. The author also recognizes that an effective deflector shield also makes for a decent cloaking device: the shields also block light, and must be dropped to return fire or send and receive transmissions. This means that ships under heavy enough fire can't shoot back, nor can they radio for help or give orders.
</li><li> Most starships in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikhailAkhmanov">Mikhail Akhmanov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> books have shields. In fact, ships without shields might as well be made of tissue paper, given the sort of energies involved in space combat. The first novel still has human ships unshielded, as it takes place in the pre-FTL days. The first contact between a human cruiser and the enormous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Faata</a> starship has the cruiser arriving to the area of a strange gamma-burst and not find anything, since the Faata ship's shields also act as a cloaking device to the primitive human sensors. When the Faata use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TractorBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TractorBeam">Tractor Beam</a> on the cruiser, the human captain panics and orders a blind strike with the cruiser's "swarms" (a shotgun-like burst of magnetically-accelerated icicles). The Faata shields not only deflect, but <em>reflect</em> the burst back at the cruiser, shredding the ship.

However, each hit burns away part of the shroud and it takes time for these holes to fill back in. In addition, shrouds can't be projected far enough from a ship's hull to cover the ethersails at their full extent, so a ship in combat has to choose between leaving their ethersails vulnerable to enemy fire or curtailing their own speed and maneuverability.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has lots of shields and force fields.
<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, we even get to watch these get invented. <em>Enterprise</em> (NX-01) herself did not have shields (except in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a>), but appears to have had some kind of "navigational deflector" to avoid being pierced by space dust. NX-01 <em>Enterprise</em> instead has "polarized hull plating" which, though it was routinely charged before a battle, proved almost useless against advanced energy weapons. One wonders just how flimsy their hull would be <em>without</em> its hull plating polarized.
</li><li> According to Treknobabble, the solidity of holograms in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TrekVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TrekVerse">Trek Verse</a> is the result of their being surrounded by a highly specialized force field. The abundance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">Tim Taylor Technology</a> coupled with the availability of force fields has led some to theorize that, in fact, <em>all</em> Federation technology is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReinforceField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReinforceField">held together by tiny force fields</a>.
</li><li> The navigational deflector has been a canonical part of <em>Trek</em> since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, and explains why the ship isn't flayed apart when going exponentially faster than light. It was just never properly mentioned until a certain famous episode in <em>The Next Generation</em>, but ever since then, it stopped being a deflector and became a general-purpose power emitter. You can use it to blast things, hold open or close rips in time, jump-start somebody else's ship, or hell, maybe punch open wormholes for all we know. Voyager briefly goes to low warp with the navigational deflector offline in the episode 'Year Of Hell' and takes damage as a result.
</li><li> "The Outrageous Okona" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">The Next Generation</a></em> features a scene where Worf and Picard react with incredulity at a primitive ship locking lasers on them. Turns out that ship's power generation is so low that her lasers can't even penetrate the <em>Enterprise-D</em>'s navigational shields, let alone the main shields.
</li><li> The novel <em>Federation</em> features a wonderful interplay of cloaking, shields, antimatter containment fields, and Captain Picard that results in Picard taking out a Romulan ship by flying the <em>Enterprise</em> through it, sustaining almost no damage, and watching as the Romulans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">suddenly stop being there</a>.
</li><li> Almost every ship also has a structural integrity field, which holds the ships's structure together, necessitated by the size of some of the larger ships and also to minimize structural stress from acceleration and damage. This, however, qualifies not as a Deflector Shield but as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReinforceField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReinforceField">Reinforce Field</a>.
</li><li> There's also an additional field on top of that called an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertialDampening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertialDampening">inertial damper</a> &mdash; which essentially prevents the crew from turning into blood splotches on wall upon rapid acceleration and deceleration. Whenever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarTrekShake">Star Trek Shake</a> is employed, this is because the inertial dampening systems are capable of compensating for the ship's movements, but not always for the massive sudden excess energy imparted by weapons fire or impacts. Lampshaded in one <em>Voyager</em> episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Harry Kim:</strong> Can we go to low warp? <br><strong>Tom Paris:</strong> The ship might make it without inertial dampeners but we'll all be stains on the back wall.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>. The Liberator is protected by a "force wall" against plasma bolts, meteor storms, or even tiny particles of dust if they're going fast enough. However it's very energy consumptive; in "Duel" the Liberator's power banks are so low they can only raise the force wall just before the plasma bolt strikes. There's also a flare shield that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWithTheSafetyOnYouWont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWithTheSafetyOnYouWont">must be raised before firing the neutron blasters</a>, apparently to stop the crew being injured by reflected glare and radiation from their own weapons. The force wall was one of several superior technologies that made the Liberator quite a battlewagon &mdash; in "The Harvest of Kairos" Servalan is shocked that the Liberator can fire through its own force wall, and has the ability to overlap its force walls for greater protection. There were several mentions of defense fields and screens used to protect spaceships or surface installations, so the Federation apparently has similar albeit less advanced technology.

<ul><li> Note that there is also a distinction drawn in one episode between starship force fields that work like those on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> (repel everything indiscriminately) and smaller personal shields that work like those on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> (let slow-moving objects through); both exist in the <em>Stargate</em> universe. Also, Goa'uld ships <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">use force fields instead of glass for windows</a>. One thing about Goa'uld forcefields (that was pretty much always portrayed with continuity) is that they are one-way. Thus, they stop all attacks coming from the outside, but don't impede firing from the inside or launching smaller ships, with no need to open dangerous holes in the shield.
</li><li> Jack unloaded a magazine at the System Lord Heru-ur, only for the bullets to bounce harmlessly off his personal shield - then Jack hurled a throwing knife at him, impaling Heru-ur through the hand, causing him to retreat by teleporting away. Carter then praises Jack for correctly deducing that the shields don't stop slower objects (otherwise the wearer couldn't move), but from his reaction, it's clear that Jack just threw the knife <em>in desperation</em>.
</li><li> One episode has Jack, Sam, and Daniel acquire armbands that grant them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>.

The shield is unique in the series in that it does not degrade as it takes damage and the amount of power it consumes is proportional to the strain it is under; if it is not under any strain it can stay active indefinitely. The shield, coupled with a sufficient power source has been shown to resist: orbital bombardment from the entire Wraith fleet, water pressure from the bottom of the ocean (hence the legend of Atlantis sinking beneath the waves) and extended over an entire planet to resist a coronal mass ejection. It can also be modified to act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthinSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthinSpace">cloaking device</a> and Anti-replicator shield.
</li><li> <em>Destiny</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> has an Ancient-style shield, although less advanced than the Atlantis one. Unlike most shields, it's not a bubble, but extends maybe 10 meters in every direction from the hull. The shield is vital for FTL travel, since space particles and meteors smashing into the hull at FTL speeds would be... unhealthy, but is not as practical for combat, since the discharge of weapon fire on the shield is close enough to affect the ship, even when the blast itself is blocked.

<ul><li> Shields as <em>Star Trek</em> popularized the concept are largely absent but the highly advanced aliens from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Thirdspace</a></em> have them; it doesn't make them invincible but it makes them capable of withstanding several orders of magnitude more firepower than the other races. A handful of their fighters are devastating as their shields largely protect them while they fling energy blasts as big as the fighter itself. A single Starfury is shown being unable to punch through the shield in the time it takes one of the fighters to aim and shoot it. We also see a White Star going one on one with one of the fighters; it has an easier time than a single Starfury and kills the fighter, but takes heavy damage in the tradeoff. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The gate to Thirdspace is also shielded once its powered up. While it can eat the firepower of the entire fleet assembled to defend against the aliens, it, too, has limits.

</li><li> The Vorlon too have shields for their larger ships, allowing them to shrug off attacks from the Younger Races and tank even ones from the Shadows, First Ones like the Vorlon themselves.
<ul><li> The White Stars, built by the Minbari but including Vorlon technology, have shields too. They are however a lot less effective, as the Vorlon technology transfer did not include their advanced power sources.
</li></ul></li><li> While it wasn't stated onscreen, background materials reveal that some of the the Younger Races have some form of shield technology:
<ul><li> The Abbai have proper deflector shields for their ships, based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a>. Abbai technology isn't really anything special in most regards, but their entire military mindset is based on defense rather than offense, so they're ahead of the curve in this regard-as shown by races with more advanced artificial gravity technology (such as the Hyach, the Centauri, the Minbari, and even the Brakiri, that have the <em>most</em> advanced artificial gravity among the Younger Races) having failed to develop shields.
</li><li> Some time after the series the Minbari started building ships equipped with shields. While not confirmed, it's implied they managed to reverse-engineer it from the Vorlon-designed shield generators for the White Stars.
</li><li> Human military ships have the E-Web, a weak shield that softens, rather than fully block, enemy attacks. This one is actually seen on-screen early during the Earth Alliance Civil War, when the rebelling <em>Agamemnon</em> is being chased by a loyalist EarthForce ship of the same class and tanks a heavy laser from them-then the XO of the <em>Agamemnon</em> mentions that the chasing ship has deactivated its E-Web defenses to launch fighters, and a single shot from their heavy laser blows up the pursuer.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series, the Reapers, have what is likely one of the strongest force fields ever created implanted into each of them. Not only are they so strong that any Reaper can effectively just ram through a non-Reaper ship and keep going, but it's stated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the codex</a> that whenever they land on a planet a majority of their energy is diverted to their shields in order to keep them both from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReentryScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReentryScare">burning up</a> when they hit the atmosphere and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">collapsing under their own weight</a> when on a sufficiently large planet.
</li><li> Heavy-duty force fields, of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Prothean</a> and geth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">vis-a-vis Reaper</span> origin, pop up throughout the game. An amusing interlude occurs when you first find Liara, who has managed to get herself locked inside a Prothean force-field bubble while trying to avoid a small army of geth and krogan mercenaries.
</li><li> Starship-scaled Kinetic Barriers are far more common applications of the large-scale version. They allow deflection of debris and mass accelerator rounds, but only up to a certain point. As their name also implies, they're <em>kinetic</em> barriers; laser-based weaponry can bypass them completely but has yet to be developed beyond defensive weaponry.
</li><li> In the second game, you can improve the <em>Normandy</em> with a new type of kinetic barrier that significantly improves the damage absorption by jerking the incoming object (be it a kinetic round or a huge piece of debris) sideways to decrease the force impacting the barrier.
</li></ul></li><li> The Covenant in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series use energy shields for all sorts of things, including to cover their massive starships. The humans managed to eventually reverse-engineer this technology for their own ships and vehicles. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, deactivating a certain part of a Covenant ship's shields is handy for infiltrating said ship. For example, a common boarding strategy is to blast the shields, then blast the newly exposed ship, destroying that section's shield generator. The Spartans then fly in through the shield hole, and find an opening.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion">Master of Orion</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first game has shields substracting their level from damage dealt by each weapon.
</li><li> The series as a whole has the standard deflector shield technology that you can research for your starships, but also lets you build artificial magnetic fields for irradiated planets. Of course you can later upgrade those into full-blown planetary deflector shields.
</li><li> In <em>Master of Orion 2</em> ship design allows devices buffing shield properties, like "Hard Shields" (resists shield-piercing weapons and nebulae, increases level), "Shield Capacitors" (increases recharge rate between combat turns), and "Multiphased Shields" (50% greater shield strength). The shields are segmented into 4 arcs and each turn they regenerate an amount based on the strongest arc, though enveloping weapons hit all four at once. There's also "Personal Shield" technology that gives major bonus in ground combat and boarding.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">Exotic technologies</a> include "Damper Field", which replaces standard deflector shields with an energy field that reduces any incoming damage by 75% and has 50% chance to kill teleporting boarders. "Reflector Field" is compatible both with shields and Damper Field and gives a chance to reflect weapons fire back at the shooter.
</li></ul></li><li> In the later entries of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceEmpires">Space Empires</a></em> series, you have regular shields and phased shields. Regular shields can be bypassed by "phased" weapons (which skip them entirely, but are a little weaker than regular weapons) whilst phased shields block everything.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> RPG series features the golem Asgard who seems to specialize in deflector shields. Notably, its shields completely disintegrate anything that touches them when they're on. In the original game, the characters realized that this meant that the golem who supposedly had the Ultimate Defense also had the Ultimate Offense and used the golem to break through another force field around the enemies' base. Later games simply took it for granted that Asgard would be attacking with moves like Barrier Fist and whatnot, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArmsXF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArmsXF">Wild ARMs XF</a></em> gave Asgard the ability Barrier Storm, which instantly killed anyone standing next to it by doing more damage than your maximum HP.

</li><li> Shields feature prominently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em>, where they were originally reverse-engineered from an alien race by the Aeon, then stolen and copied by the UEF and Cybran Nation. All three factions have powerful stationary shield generators that project a spherical shield around their area. They can all upgrade them a little, with the UEF beating the other two by being able to get up to level seven, and having an "artillery shield roughly four times the size of even that. The Aeon take things a step further with a number of units sporting personal shield generators that conform over the unit. The UEF also gets in on the personal shield idea with their siege bot and Fatboy-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMashupMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMashupMachine">Military Mashup Machine</a>, then adding in a naval-based shield generator in <em>Forged Alliance</em>. The sneaky Cybrans only use shields in stationary defensive installations.
</li><li> In the old video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScorchedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScorchedEarth">Scorched Earth</a></em>, in addition to normal energy shields, you could use a literal Deflector Shield which would deflect missiles off course from your tank.
</li><li> Since the Two Cities update to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, the Medic can, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Mann vs. Machine</a> mode, upgrade his Medigun to create one of these after building up enough energy from healing teammates. Said shield blocks <em>all</em> robot attacks, bullets and otherwise, while allowing his team to shoot from safety. It also damages robots that touch it, but they can still walk through it.

Sometimes they make it impossible to actually defeat them all at once, requiring that you defeat the out-of-the-way one before taking on the remaining two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> also had an energy barrier protecting the door to the lair of Agahnim (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">either Ganondorf in disguise, or a part of him, or just The Dragon</a>), for which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Master Sword</a> was needed to break.

Naturally, the barrier generator (a crystal, of course) shatters, kicking off the main plot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousFloatingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousFloatingCastle">Lunatic Pandora</a> is protected by a <em>massive</em> energy field... which is promptly pierced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Ragnarok</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">ramming it</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, the Garleans love to deploy Magitek Barriers to keep out those nasty, nasty magic-using savages of Eorzea. Both the main story of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> and <em>Stormblood</em> have our heroes being forced to shut down these barriers somehow to get to a critical goal.
</li></ul></li><li> A common feature in the universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</em> There are both large deflector shields, designed to protect buildings from airborne attacks from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>, and smaller, personal shields used by both good and evil soldiers to prevent you from damaging them.
</li><li> Deflector shields, both ship-mounted and man (animal?) portable versions, occur frequently throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em> game series.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em>, there are two mazes involving force fields, which basically behave like near-invisible walls (there's a little sparkle to them). One is found in a room after you activate the Quake Pad in the center, and the force field makes up the inner walls of the maze. Your challenge is to get to the exit before time runs out. Another maze also has regular walls, but force fields block your way to the end when you activate the Quake Pad. You have to turn off each one at a switch or by shooting a Blast Board, and most switches are blocked somehow. Again, a timed challenge.
</li><li> Also, floating robots commonly have shields. The ones in Dragon Rock require you to use an Earthwalker horn to disable the generators, and the one in the Krazoa Palace has the unusual disabling method of shooting colored gems through color-changing flames.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxZero">Star Fox Zero</a></em> the Granby has a new shield that it uses in response to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> on Pepper's flagship, preventing the weapon from having any effect. However, the Granby cannot fire through its own shield, so it must open small holes in the shield to fire its lasers through. The player has to slip inside these holes and disable the shield before the ship can be destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sections of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> are sealed off with force fields, especially when it comes to the research stations and the Phazon Mines. Most disabling is accomplished by scanning somewhere, but one goes down when a Phazon Elite <em>punches</em> it.
</li><li> Some fields are used to reinforce the glass walls of the Metroid cages. This allows the Pirates to study the Metroid while still being protected from the monstrous life-sucking jellyfish alien. Once you cut the power, however, they start breaking through the glass to attack both you and the Pirates. This happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">all</a> the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em> games.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em>, energy shielding is a regular part of space combat, though unlike many other universes shielding hasn't been miniaturized enough to protect personnel. There's a constant struggle between shields and weapons to penetrate them, with some games having shields impenetrable by anything other than a special torpedo on the larger warships, while other games allow any weapon to cause damage. This is averted in the capital warship game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> Arena</em>, where the players are flying fighters that are either attacking or defending huge battlecruisers that have massive amounts of armor, but no shielding to free up energy for their guns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em> has these on all ships. The Caldari and some Minmatar ships, rely on shields as their primary means of defense (as opposed to the Gallente and Amarr, who rely chiefly on armor plating).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SinsOfASolarEmpire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a></em>, most ships have this, with absence being the exception. The Vasari have phase missiles that have a chance of bypassing shields and striking armor.

<ul><li> The Terran and Vasudan ships initially have no deflector shields, and the shielded Shivan fighters are nigh-invulnerable to their weapons. Fortunately, observation of Shivan technology allows the good guys to develop both shields and more effective weapons in short order. However, shields do not work in subspace, and the Shivans share this disadvantage. But it comes up exactly <em>once</em> in the entire single player campaign, so it's not something that can be counted on.
</li><li> The Shivan Destroyer Lucifer takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Not only is it the only Destroyer-class warship ever to be equipped with shields, but it's also completely invulnerable against all forms of weaponry.

Segmented into 2,4 or 8 sectors depending on the ship, station or turret type. The main limitation is that shields are disabled by activation of either spatial distortion drive, jump drive or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace">cloak</a>. However, many weapons (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">all kinetics</a> and otherwise weak lasers) can <em>partially</em> bypass shields.

<ul><li> Shields are a major branch of research; ships with a "shield" section get a rechargeable bonus to their health. The Liir and Morrigi are experts in their use, while Hivers and Zuul usually have less than 20% chance of getting even the most basic of shielding. It should be noted that it may not always be the best solution, as a shield/deflector generator takes up a <em>full third</em> of the ship, making it impossible to place weapons on the front of a shielded ship.
</li><li> There are also several different variations of shields. Deflectors create a forward-facing hemisphere that blocks almost any ballistic and missile weapon. Disruptor shields are the reverse &mdash; they create a hemisphere that blocks any energy weapon. Torpedoes are stopped by both deflectors and disruptor shields. Standard shields completely envelop the ship and protect against most types of attack but can be overloaded by too much damage (unlike deflectors and disruptor shields). There are other types of shields, including small directed shield projectors, automatically facing the strongest enemy weapon and mounted on heavy weapons hardpoints. Cloaking generators are also in the same research tree, as the principle is similar.

Essentially, this doubles their health, and the shields (unlike, in most cases, the actual health) regenerate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Deflector shields are a standard equipment on all small ships. The difference between taking shield damage and hull damage, apart from a loud "CLANNNNNNNGGGGG!", is that taking hull damage also hurts your weapons and equipment, eventually destroying them.
</li><li> There are also three types of shields which are strong against some types of weapons but weak against others. For example, graviton shields are strong against laser, photon, and pulse weapons but weak against plasma and particle weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elite">Elite</a></em> games, shields are a necessity. Generators are stackable, not segmented and absorb even collision damage.

Ironically, one of the few beam weapons in the Gundam universe that is canonically designed to bypass beam shielding entirely does not exhibit such behavior in SRW.

This shield functions as extra HP that needs to be shot through in order to hurt the Mechtoid itself, but fully regenerates every time a Sectoid Mind-Melds with the Mechtoid. However, shooting the Sectoid generating the shield not only shuts down the shield instantly, but hurts the Mechtoid too.

However, while shields are great at protecting against various laser and particle beam weapons they provide <em>very</em> little protection against missiles or mass drivers and have a diminishing return on protection against anything other than beam weapons (The actual formula in game uses the square root of the shield power when hit by missiles or projectiles). You need countermeasures to protect against missiles and armor to protect against projectiles.

A third type of ship, the Avatar used by the Chmmr, is surrounded by three smaller ships which are connected by a series of lasers which destroy any oncoming projectiles.

The shield has to be toggled on manually, lasts for a second or two, and then is inactive as it recharges. It probably doesn't protect vehicles from EMP weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyrian">Tyrian</a></em> features recharging energy shields which draw power from the ships generator to recharge; choosing a weak generator can result in a slow recharge and your weapons cutting out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a>:</em>
<ul><li> <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em>, a game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">questionable canonicity</a>, features the Sentinel pods, which can project defensive shields when in groups. In order to form a complete "bubble" over the target, 12 Sentinels are required (the game has a max cap of 24 Sentinels). These shields come in three varieties: green (protects against kinetic weapons), yellow (protects against kinetic and missile weapons), and red (protects against kinetic, missile, and ion weapons). Each level must be researched first. Shield sections disappear when overloaded and take time to regenerate. The shields are of a one-way variety, so the protected ship can still fire its weapons. The Sentinels themselves are unprotected and weak, so it is easier to destroy them rather than the shield. Large objects (e.g. ships) can still pass through the shield.
</li><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">manual</a>, during the testing of the Sentinels, one of them accidentally sliced through a frigate with its shield, destroying it. Unfortunately, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">doesn't allow</a> you to do that.
</li><li> The <em>Homeworld</em> series also features the defense field frigate, which projects a protective energy field for short amounts of time. Its usefulness is debatable though, as it requires a fair bit of micromanagement to actually shield other ships from enemy fire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Perimeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Perimeter">Perimeter</a></em>: The eponymous Perimeter is a dome-like force field players can raise over parts of their bases (or whole bases). It's virtually impenetrable to attacks and incinerates everything that trying to pass through but has a very high energy cost. It also has a unique ability to steal enemy buildings - erect a field-generator close to them, raise the field - vois la!
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series, shields are the only viable defense&mdash;hull is very weak and damage translates to very expensive equipment getting destroyed. Hull defense is significantly upgraded in <em>Albion Prelude</em>, however, to reflect the war situation. That, and making ships more survivable if their shields are down.
</li><li> A strategic aspect in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarRaiders">Star Raiders</a></em>. Although a single hit when the shields were down would instantly kill the player, daredevil pilots would engage the Zylons with damaged (flickering) or destroyed shields <em>anyway</em> just to avoid a time-consuming trip to a starbase.

It's never made clear whether it's a shield <em>composed of</em> plasma or one that protects <em>from</em> plasma (seeing how the Schwarzwelt is, itself, surrounded by a plasma wall that disintegrates whatever it touches,) but not only is it explicitly enabled every time the <em>Red Sprite</em> jumps between dimensions within the Schwarzwelt, but presumably it's what keeps demons from tearing the ship to pieces while the Strike Team commandos are on a mission.

The reason you don't leave shields raised all the time is that doing so may be seen as a hostile gesture, just like having your weapons constantly armed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndOfNations">End of Nations</a></em> many units can be equiped with shields that absorb all the damage for a limited amount of hitpoints and time. Also, the Liberation Front class has access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPower">Support Powers</a> that raise completely impenetrable shields on the units within an area for a very short time frame.

Larger capital ships take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">Subsystem Damage</a> before being destroyed. Bomber wings are the usual counter to capital ships, as they fire shield-piercing photon torpedoes. The usual tactic is to send your bombers to take out the target ship's or station's shield generator. The <em>Forces of Corruption</em> expansion adds the Zann Consortium faction with the <em>Vengeance</em>-class frigates, which lack shields of their own but are armed with shield-piercing mass drivers.
</li><li> The Rebels' counterpart to the Imperial Star Destroyer is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">Mon Calamari</a> Cruiser, which is weaker overall but doesn't have a shield generator subsystem, meaning its shields have to be brought down the old-fashioned way. Admiral Abkbar's flagship <em>Home One</em> is a unique Mon Calamari Cruiser and <em>does</em> have a shield generator subsystem.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusTheJupiterIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusTheJupiterIncident">Nexus: The Jupiter Incident</a></em> starts out with primitive Earth ships that don't have any shields. After acquiring the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Angelwing</a></em>, you get shields. All Noah, Gorg, Vardrag, and Ghost ships have shields. Higher-end lasers are able to pierce them (with reduced effect), but lasers are designed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">damage subsystems</a> not damage the hull (except Ghost lasers, which are powerful enough to do both). Shields deactivate when scanning or cloaked. The Noah fleet has also developed the Fortress Shield, which is fitted on a <em>Colossus</em>-class support ship and creates a huge shield bubble that protects any ship inside but allows ships inside to fire out. It doesn't prevent enemy from entering the bubble, though, although any normal shield fails inside the bubble. The only way to destroy the Fortress Shield is with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Siege Laser</a>, which can only be mounted on battleships and requires the combined energy of three other ships to fire. Ordinary mass drivers don't do much damage against shields. However, there is a whole branch of "energy shell" type weapons that don't do any physical damage but can overwhelm and collapse shields. Higher-end mass drivers are more effective against shields, but it's still better to use energy shells (using both is taxing on your power generator).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GroundControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GroundControl">Ground Control</a> 2</em> has city spanning energy shields, unfortunately the enemy has things that can pass straight though them. The shields are mainly there to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment">Orbital Bombardment</a>, but they don't stop the enemy from landing drop pods.

Docking with a starbase can repair your ship and restore your shields.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps">Naval Ops</a></em> series has two flavours of shields for ships: Gravity shields that deflect physical projectiles, and Magnetic shields that deflect lasers. End-game or New Game Plus enemies frequently have one equipped, as can a player ship after enough research or a lucky drop.
</li><li> In the MMOFPS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide 2</a></em>, successfully capturing a large base (an Amp Station, a Biolab, or a Tech Plant) will cause the facility's defense system to charge up before activating a large, transparent shield around the base. This is purely cosmetic, though, and does not actually impact gameplay.
</li><li> Ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em> have shields which block enemy beams and lasers, but not missiles. The Halberd and Glaive beam weapons can pierce one/two layers at reduced damage, respectively and there's a special laser weapon that can bypass one layer of shields, used by the B variant of the rock cruiser. There is also the "Super Shield", mainly used by the Zoltan, which blocks everything such as missiles, crew/bomb teleportation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> (unless you have a Super Shield Bypass) but it can only take a limited amount of hits before dissipating, ion and beam weapons notably do more damage to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands2</a></em>: In addition to the personal shields carried over from the first game, a plot critical mission has the player fetch a power core for the shield generator that protects the city of Sanctuary.
</li><li> All ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCommand">Star Command</a></em> have shields, although they work differently for enemy ships compared to the player's ship. For the enemy, they merely act as more armor and do not regenerate. For the player's ship, they are significantly weaker (they go down after just one hit), but they can regenerate. Additionally, active shields block an attempt by the enemy to teleport <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingParty">boarding parties</a>. The only exception is the second mission, where the obsolete Soviet transporter technology is able to bypass modern shields, as they're not designed to block them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarbaseOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarbaseOrion">Starbase Orion</a></em>: shields are an ship/starbase equipment that can be researched and used in a design. There are 4 levels of shield research. There are also additional components that improve the shield. Shields normally don't work within a nebula, but a certain component can allow them to function even there. Lasers and plasma turrets deal bonus damage to shields, while Gauss turrets and ion pulse cannons deal reduced damage (Gauss turrets, in fact, are pretty much useless against shields). Unlike armor or structure, shields regenerate during battle. Additionally, ion pulse cannons deal extra damage to structure when hitting an active shield, which can make shields a liability when facing an IPC-armed enemy.
</li><li> Various types of shields are present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ascendancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a></em>. They vary wildly in descriptions and principle, but function basically the same in-game, varying only in strength and the amount of power used up. Shields typically only drain the ship's batteries when struck by enemy fire, except for one low-level passive shield that doesn't drain power at all. Visually, if a ship is struck by a weapon that is completely absorbed by the shield, the effect is only a shield fizzle. If the weapon even partially penetrates the shield, the weapon's explosive effect is shown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InvisibleInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InvisibleInc">Invisible, Inc.</a></em>: Unique to special K&amp;O guards, they grant the highest armor in the game but can be hacked and deactivated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheArcadeGame">Star Wars: The Arcade Game</a></em>: Your X-Wing Fighter can take several hits before its shield is destroyed, with one more hit ending the game. Completing a level with the destruction of the Death Star regenerates the shield by one hit point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FromTheDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FromTheDepths">From the Depths</a></em>, boats and aircraft use multiple planar shields rather than the typical all-encompassing bubble. With the game's heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">Design-It-Yourself Equipment</a>, players place shield emitters, customize the size, angle, and their effectiveness with a corresponding increase in engine power drain. Shields can reflect or deflect incoming missiles and cannon fire, but have no effect on lasers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">ramming attacks</a>. Of note is that improperly configured shield arrays can make incoming damage <em>worse</em> at certain angles, as shields can end up funneling ricocheting projectiles to singular points.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Sunrider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Sunrider">Sunrider</a></em>, both capital ships and certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">Ryders</a> can project shields over a large radius. Because shields are so common and they become stronger where two or more shields overlap, they've rendered traditional laser weapons practically useless if you don't have a way to remotely switch off a target's shields. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">they offer no protection against kinetic weapons, which were designed specifically to counter them.</a>

</li><li> In Level 8's tablet base defense game <em>Modern Command</em>, your enemies will start sending A.I. tanks and bombers that are protected by force fields. When that happens, you better research and build <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualAmmo">energized ammo of some kind</a> fast as enemies with force fields will shrug off purely kinetic attacks. As well your base eventually upgrades to have force field screens instead of concrete walls.
</li><li> Shield projectors can be added to techs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech">TerraTech</a></em>. They use energy to stop bullets, as well as over time, needing plenty of batteries to be of much use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a> 1</em> has separate Miracles to block physical and magical attacks, while the sequel combines them into one. In each case, the Miracle creates a spherical barrier of any size, which drains the caster's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> over time at a rate proportionate to its size and the amount of damage it absorbs. However, people and Creatures can walk straight through.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SierraOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SierraOps">Sierra Ops</a></em> has vector fields, which are normally so bulky and energy-intensive that they can only be mounted on space colonies. The <em>Sierra</em> and the <em>Lapis</em> are some of the first spacecraft capable of defending themselves with these fields, thanks to their prototype Lomonosov Particle Drives. In gameplay a vector field will prevent all damage to the ship until it overloads, and while it will eventually recharge, you&#146;ll need to switch it back on manually.

Most relativistic interstellar ships are covered in a thick layer of rock in front to deflect debris when traveling at high speeds. There are deflector shields but they're active systems that use a powerful laser to ionize particles in front of the ship and then magnetic fields to deflect the ions.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TechInfantry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TechInfantry">Tech Infantry</a></em>, although all starships have standard electromagnetic deflector shields that protect them from micrometeorites and induced cosmic rays when traveling at a substantial percentage of light speed. Some of the larger warships have gravity-based shields created by their gravitic drives, but these are of limited utility, as it's hard to shoot out through a zone of such intense gravity that it can bend weapon beams away or crush incoming missiles.
</li><li> An almost universal technology in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAngel">The Last Angel</a></em>. The basic technology completely disintegrates physical objects that strike it, but only partially diffuses energy weapons, allowing them to penetrate in weakened form. Unlike standard scifi shields, Angelverse shields actually use 'more' power the weaker they are, collapsing only when either there is no longer enough power to keep them up or, more commonly, when the shield becomes so saturated that the shield generator(s) cannot keep up with the stress and have to be shut down before they fail catastrophically. On top of that, each major power has a different implementation of, and terminology for, the technology:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Compact</a> "Screens" are a simple bubble that surrounds the entire spacecraft and all the surface area means that they can take a <em>lot</em> of damage before they finally go down, but once they go down, they stay down for far longer than any other design.

Each individual barrier can be brought down quite quickly, but can be restored just as fast.
</li><li> The United Earth Confederacy, and by extension <em>Nemesis</em>, used "shields" that consisted of a single large plate covering each major facing, overlapping at the edges, providing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">balance</a> between the above systems.
<ul><li> Red One has improved on the Confederate technology significantly in her two millennia of existence, equipping her ship self <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and those of her children</span> with so called "reset shields" that use a combination of secondary systems and technology beyond the other powers to restore a shield section to full strength in a matter of seconds instead of minutes.

</li><li> In "The Crystal Empire", Cadance shields the eponymous city from King Sombra with a similar barrier, which breaks down when she becomes exhausted. This time, Shining Armor can't use his own barrier spell because Sombra nullified his magic with black crystals.

Danny, as a half-ghost, has a special advantage against ghost shields in that he can pass them while in human form. Which doesn't <em>quite</em> make sense when you consider that he still registers as "ghost" on various equipment whether he's in human form or not... and that he can seemingly use almost all his ghost powers (minus flying) while in human form too.

In season three it becomes a plot point: because of Valtor's attacks on the Magical Dimension, a protective barrier serving as a Lockdown is put up around Alfea, but Tecna creates a device that can break through it, and the girls sneak out at night often (usually to fight against Valtor or deal with other problems). When they are caught, Faragonda and Griselda explain that the more they break through the barrier, the weaker it becomes.
<ul><li> Cloud Tower has one too, that prevents uninvited people from going to the castle. Valtor and the Trix get around it by transforming into a deer and three wolves who some students try to coax into the castle for a spell.

There's also "Field" spells that dissipate magic energy within them, as well as magically hardened armor in their Barrier Jackets.

The barriers themselves can be invisible or semi-visible, resembling a pane of glass. The barriers don't have any inherent special properties, other than acting as an indestructible wall.

Outer Shells are what make adventuring and fighting against monsters possible. The protagonist Rude has an exceptionally powerful Outer Shell (as seen in the title) which makes him a great tank. Even more so since he has two unique skills that take full advantage of it &mdash; one that allows him to take all of the damage to his comrades' Outer Shells in their place, and another that allows him to deliver a powerful counterattack based on how much of his Outer Shell was depleted. Unfortunately, he was unaware of these skills (skill appraisal is a very rare ability in that world), so it looked like he simply had an Outer Shell that drained away abnormally quickly &mdash; this was the justification the Hero Kygras used to kick Rude out of the party. Which in turn would have dire consequences for Kygras since <em>his</em> skill was one that drained his own Outer Shell for a power boost &mdash; and he had just kicked out the tank who was taking the depletion in his place.

Ostensibly these are designed to repel, or at least deflect, bolts from the plasma-type weapons the Confederation Marines are equipped with. Since 99% of trouble spots where said Marines gets deployed features combatants with no such weaponry, and the shields don't do a thing against projectiles, they very quickly went out the window in favor of "old-fashioned" body armor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, shields are a common defense used by many wizards. Harry Dresden carries a "shield bracelet," which is a magical focus that allows him to finely control his magical power to generate shields in a variety of shapes. His initial shield only produced a barrier against kinetic attacks, to defend against things like bullets, but after a cunning villain took advantage of that with flamethrowers, he developed a different focus that could defend against nearly anything, including magical attacks. In a couple of cases, he's actually used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">barriers as a weapon</a>, by using them to deflect incoming fire or altering the barrier to reflect light, creating a mirror to startle opponents.

Personal shields of assorted types tend to stop pretty much anything (exceptions are rare), but can be overwhelmed by sustained fire from suitably heavy weapons readily enough.
</li><li> Another fantasy example is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle">The Death Gate Cycle</a></em>, where the Patryns tattoo magical runes all over their bodies for magical protection. However, these aren't perfect shields &mdash; in the second book, when faced against a giant monster, the main character's magical shield broke under the giant's assault with a tree trunk. The explanation being that the powerful blows caused cracks to form between the sigla that comprise the magical barrier, thus weakening and ultimately obliterating the shield.

<ul><li> Like everything else in <em>40K</em>, personal force fields are available in a wide variety of sizes and craziness. The Imperium, Tau and Eldar use force fields of varied effects, rarity and effectiveness to protect their higher ranking troops and Orks build "Kustom Force Fields" which they carry into battle to protect blobs of troops. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Titans</a> have Void Shields, although that's stretching the definition of "personal", while all large spacecraft have void shields or an equivalent, with the occasional possible exception of orks.
</li><li> Included among the various personal shields are:
<ul><li> Refractor Fields (Imperial) generate a dimly-glowing energy field that attempts to disperse the energy of a hit throughout the entire shield and are the "default" Force Field of Imperial Forces. The Iron Halo worn by some Space Marines is a variant of Refractor Field technology. A more rare variant is the Reductor Field, which attempts to simply nullify an incoming attack's energy rather than redirect it. Commissar Yarrick wears a Reductor Field.
</li><li> Conversion Fields (Imperial), which attempt to convert incoming thermal and kinetic energy into radiant energy. The more powerful the hit, the brighter the flash of light. In the spin-off game <em>Inquisitor,</em> a Refractor that stopped a sufficiently powerful attack had an effect very similar to a flashbang grenade on nearby models. The Rosarius worn by members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Ecclesiarchy</a> and Space Marine Chaplains are a compact variant of Conversion Field technology.
</li><li> Displacer Shields (Imperial), which aren't quite shields in the usual sense; they attempt to detect incoming attacks and <em>teleport the wearer away.</em> Given that Imperial teleportation tech is unreliable, poorly-understood and prone to spectacularly lethal failures, the Displacer is almost as likely to kill you as the incoming attack is. On the upshot, when the Displacer Field works, it's 100% effective since you and the triggering attack are no longer in the same place. It's worth noting that the Orks have weaponized this technology in the form of the Shokk Attack Gun.
</li><li> Shadow Fields (Dark Eldar) are energy sinks which absorb incoming attacks completely, providing excellent protection, though they can be overwhelmed by attacks that transfer more energy into them than the Shadow Field can absorb.
</li><li> Shimmershields (Eldar) project a wide-area energy field (sufficient to cover an entire squad) that interferes with melee attacks. Shimmershields offer no protection against ranged attacks, implying that they are only effective against slow-moving weapons.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bhja');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4bhja" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bhja');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Given Eldar mastery of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a>, Shimmershields may be generating an effect that locally reduces the effective mass of any object within it with a velocity above a fairly low threshold. This would reduce the effectiveness of melee weapons, which tend to rely on mass to do damage, but would leave fast-moving projectiles, which get the majority of their energy from velocity, largely unaffected.</span>
</li><li> Shield Generators (Tau) appear to function similarly to Imperial Refractor Fields, projecting a spherical energy field around the wearer that glows and crackles as it spreads the energy of an incoming attack across its entire surface.

</li><li> <em>Globe of invulnerability</em> is another spell, this time creating a globe around the caster that blocks all low-level spells anyone tries to cast through it.
</li><li> Also an item called Bracers of Armor. They come in eight different strengths and while considerably more expensive than normal armor of the same protective quality, they serve the same role without inhibiting mobility in any way. They are also considerably lighter, weighing only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCustomaryMeasurements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCustomaryMeasurements">one pound</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Telekinetic</a> power <em>kinetic control</em> absorbs impacts while storing the energy, so the user can be battered and shot without any harm, then deliver all this abuse or part of it to some poor sod or piece of furniture instantly with a touch. If not discharged, it kicks even worse upon deactivation, though.
</li><li> The abjuration-specialized Wizard in 5th edition gets an arcane ward that protects them from damage. At lv. 6, they can use it to defend their allies.

Energy force fields are early model force field projectors and offer weak to decent levels of damage absorption before collapsing. Kinetic force fields are more advanced and offer significantly more protection. Magnetic force fields a.k.a Repulsion force fields don't absorb damage like the previous two types. Instead this type of force fields makes it more difficult successfully strike a target (Repulsion fields increase "armor class" with the amount depending on the quality of the projector).

Aside from being lighter and easier to conceal (hence the "discreet"; the flavor text indicates it was originally made for diplomats, spies, and others who would want to be armored without looking like they were) than normal armor, it's explicitly compatible with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalMartialArts">Supernatural Martial Arts</a>, which normally prohibit the use of armor.

<ul><li> The "kinetic barriers".

Interestingly enough, the shields' ability to only deflect certain shapes of objects traveling at certain speeds is used heavily in-game to create bullets that fly at different speeds or are shaped differently than the standard to cut through kinetic barriers more effectively.
</li><li> Although kinetic barriers are referred to as "shields" in gameplay, biotically talented forces like Adepts, Vanguards, Collectors, Cerberus Phantoms and Banshees use their powers to project something actually referred to on the health bar <em>as</em> barriers.

<ul><li> Mage character Evie has magical shields as her main source of defense. These block all magical and physical attacks; but only seem to extend as far as the surface of her skin, since clothing and armour can still be damaged (underwear can't be damaged, but that seems to be mainly due to the devs aiming for a PG-13 audience).
</li><li> As of the "Labyrinth" expansion, Evie aquired a skill that creates a large, crystal-shaped shield that offers complete invulnerability for a short time. Casting time is instant, but casting cost is high. Unlike most personal shields (and her normal magical shield), the character is fully immobilized inside (curled up in a ball); although the shield itself can be knocked around by enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, several different kinds of personal force shields are available to player characters depending on their class. Since the visual effect looks like a vaguely glowing ellipse around the character, they're often referred to as "bubbles".
<ul><li> Paladins, most famously, have <em>Divine Shield</em>, which makes the paladin completely immune to all damage for 8 seconds. They also have a spell called <em>Hand of Protection</em> which they can cast on their fellow party members, which makes them immune to physical damage for 8 seconds (but does not prevent magic damage).
</li><li> Priests can cast <em>Power Word: Shield</em> on themselves and others, which absorbs a certain number of damage points before collapsing.
</li><li> Warlocks who have summoned a Voidwalker can "sacrifice" that Voidwalker, which throws a protective barrier around the Warlock. Like the priest's shield, this barrier absorbs a certain amount of damage and then fails.
</li><li> Turtles and Beetles, two of the Hunter's Pet species, have racial abilities called "Shell Shield" and "Harden Carapace" that temporarily reduce all damage done by 50%. The graphic for the abilities is a translucent golden dome of hexagonal panels forming a shield over the Turtle/Beetle.
</li><li> Mages learn <em>Ice Block</em> which prevents all damage but also prevents all actions for 10 seconds. A more traditional example would be <em>Ice Barrier</em> which lasts a minute and prevents a given amount of damage (based on spellpower). Against weaker enemies, that latter can functionally prevent all damage done to a mage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> feature many shields. They function as additional HP gauge that can regenerate with time. If the shield you are currently using isn't up to the level of the enemies you are facing, you will not last. Electrical damage shreds them. Some shields have special properties, such as resisting a particular type of damage, dropping shield chargers when damaged that quickly let you recover your shield, being extra large at the expense of your HP, or bouncing melee damage back.
<ul><li> <em>Borderlands 3</em> also adds a small shield to Hyperion guns that deploys around the gun.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyGun">Multitool</a> module that lets you deploy a shield in front of you.

Made even cooler when the Fire shield makes most fire-based attacks pass right through, the Lightning shield doubles as a ring magnet, and the Water shield lets you breathe underwater indefinitely...until the time limit runs out, of course. These three shields returned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>.

<ul><li> Your tank can upgrade its energy shields up to three times. Getting hit will decrease the shield level by one. However, there are many attacks in the game that will destroy you regardless of shielding.
</li><li> The "Reflex Aircraft" enemies have an energy shield around them, this one has the added bonus of spraying indestructible purple shots everywhere should your regular attack damage it. However, their shields are useless against your special weapons.

The latter three also feature the Shield Gun, which is always on-hand and can be used near-indefinitely, but is less effective than actual armor.

It makes you invulnerable during the time is turned on, except against lava (you'll still catch fire as normally, although you won't lose health until the shield wears off) and sea water.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">FEAR</a></em> series, the Power Armor and Elite Power Armor units you fight usually use energy shields.

<ul><li> The series has long had a "Shield" spell, which protects the user from incoming physical damage based on the strength of the Shield spell being cast. There have also been a number of elemental and general magical variants, which protect from incoming magical attacks.
</li><li> Daedroths, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSmileAtACrocodile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSmileAtACrocodile">crocodilian</a> form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">lesser Daedra</a>, are capable of casting a Shield spell upon initiating combat, reducing the amount of physical damage they take.

Ward spells spell protect you from magic attacks (as long as the spell being cast isn't too high level for your barrier) but instead of deflecting it absorbs the energy from the spell. Naturally it's a spell in the Restoration school of magic. Ward spells reappear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">Online</a></em>.

In for Answer, your shield can even be weaponized, turning it into an explosive blast of energy that deals massive damage and completely strips other Primal Armor in the vicinity thanks to violent reaction between both. Note that this shield doesn't deflect as much as reduce impact with solid weapons due to the forcefield slowing the velocity of incoming projectiles. Bolts of laser penetrates it, plasma plays merry havoc with it, getting hit repeatedly, getting hit with something with faster-than-supersonic speeds, get hit up close either with a laserblade or a super-dense pilebunker will ruin the forcefield. On top of that, engaging extra boosters in your mech consumes the forcefield, <em>and</em> it's made from a highly toxic particles. Despite all that though, getting hit without it reduces your mech into a fiery wreck very, very fast, so it is useful to a degree.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VividConceptions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VividConceptions">Vivid Conceptions</a></em>, a "telekinetic shield" is the <em>weapon</em> of the protagonist&mdash;it kills or harms nearby bugs, and gets rid of destructible blocks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em>:
<ul><li> Booker earns not one, but two deflector shield type powers. The first is given to him as an Infusion by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Lutece Twins</a>, which causes him to generate an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">"intrinsic magnetic field"</a> that absorbs damage for brief periods of time, in the "regenerating temporary health" fashion.
</li><li> The second version is acquired late in the game, in the form of the "Return to Sender" vigor. Its first function generates a much more powerful magnetic bubble that deflects projectiles for a short period of time. The second function catches projectiles and crushes them into a semi-molten mass which Booker can then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">lob back at the offending foe(s)</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts">Xenonauts</a></em>, some larger alien ships are equipped with such. Curiously, while their efficiency is absolute, they take long to recharge, which has a major impact on air combat tactics.

Like the books they explode when hit by lasers but the detonation just destroys the target and the shooter instead of producing a nuclear reaction, not that there are many laser-equipped units outside that House. And they attract worms which would explain why no one else uses them.

Aero created a lasting barrier that halved any damage received, while Reflect produced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier">Beehive Barrier</a> that briefly negated all damage, with both spells gaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a> properties when upgraded.
</li><li> The protagonist of the first-person shooter <em>&Uuml;bersoldier</em> has the ability to temporarily generate a forcefield around himself that stops bullets. What's more, he can use it offensively, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">launching the stuck bullets back at the enemies</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">special weapons</a> is the Bubbler. When activated, it creates a bubble around its user that makes them temporarily invincible, making all damage sources push them away instead. These bubbles can spread to allies by contact, which in the right situations can completely turn around a battle.
</li><li> The Splash Wall sub weapon is effectively a throwable version of this. When thrown, it creates a raining wall of ink that stops enemy attacks dead in their tracks and instantly splats anyone foolish enough to walk into it. They stay on the field for a limited amount of time, but do dissipate faster with damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Factorio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Factorio">Factorio</a></em> has personal shields as a late-game item that can be slotted into the modular armor or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>. Individual shields don't have much health - especially the standard MK1 shields - but they regenerate <em>significantly</em> faster than health. As they are massive energy hogs when recharging, they are difficult to power until the portable fusion reactor is unlocked.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondTwoSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondTwoSouls">Beyond: Two Souls</a></em>: One of Aiden's powers is to protect Jodie by projecting a force field around her, though he really has to focus hard to do it. This allows her to do things like jump off a moving train at high speed, deflect bullets, and ram straight through a police barricade on a motorcycle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile">Path of Exile</a></em>, all armor with Intelligence requirements innately adds some amount of Energy Shield, which acts as a second layer of health that regenerates on its own. The only major caveats are that Chaos damage ignores your shield, no flasks restore it the way life flasks do for your life stat, and in general it's harder to make a functional character build that relies on Energy Shield than one focused on increased life and armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RoadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RoadRedemption">Road Redemption</a></em> has enemies that use these, which swords and tasers are specifically good against.

Both the player (with the right crystal for the Thule Medallion) and enemy Scribes are capable of projecting them, the latter with the choice of either protecting themselves or a pair of nearby mooks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans">Destroy All Humans!</a></em>, Crypto has a shield that regenerates if he doesn't take damage for some time. If the shield goes down, he's able to be killed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MogekoCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MogekoCastle">Mogeko Castle</a></em> Moge-ko has one as a special skill, Moge-ko Shield! It's strong enough to block an RPG round without issue.

Archmages and Arcane Blades have abilities that make damage shields more effective, and even characters who aren't casters can still use shield runes.
</li><li> Ion Lattice Armor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cthon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cthon">Cthon</a>.</em> It seems to be a Repulsion Field (ie, slows projectiles down instead of stopping them cold) rather than a deflector, as it provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a> instead of a second health bar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryingSuns">Crying Suns</a></em> has two distinct types of shields, both of which are represented as a bubble surrounding the protected squadron or battleship component. Absorb Shields are blue and will block a set amount of damage before collapsing, while Force Fields are golden and will make the shielded unit completely invincible for a few seconds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkDevotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkDevotion">Dark Devotion</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is a blessing which grants you a green barrier whenever you enter a room. It breaks after protecting you from one attack. Jezebel the Erratic can conjure a stronger version of this barrier, and she drops a spell book which lets the player do the same.
</li><li> Martyr the Shredded carries a magical lantern which protects him with an impenetrable red barrier. In the player's hands it becomes a floating, shapeshifting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">shield</a> with a low stamina cost.

First Starlight conjures a personal round shield (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>-style), then Twilight creates a hemispherical bubble, followed by Starlight encasing herself in a crystal-shaped field.

She later leaves Starlight in the shield in order to fetch Luna.

At first her friends believe it's Twilight's doing, but she denies it. Then the forcefield carefully lift them, bringing them to a large gathering of unicorns and other creatures coming to helps, and it expands to protect the whole group. We thus see the shield was erected collectively by all the unicorns assembled, all of their horns glowing. As the big battle is raging, the shield starts taking its toll on the unicorns and it finally falters.
