There's only one thing worse than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow">people not watching your favorite show</a>: people actually watching your favorite show.
</p><p>You'd think that your favorite artist making it big would be something to celebrate. To a large segment of modern youth, and to the eternal critic, however, a wide fanbase does not mean the media in question appeals to a lot of people, but rather that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">low-IQ trash with No Soul</a> that has "Become Commercial" and "Sold Out," possibly to the Marketing Machine or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> Himself. This results in a subsection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> and an extreme form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a>.
</p><p>In some cases, it's not an unreasonable complaint if the quality of the work begins to suffer as a result of the artist's popularity. If the artist begins to squander their talent or water down what made it interesting to make it acceptable to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">Pandering to the Base</a> rather than expanding themselves as artists in the process, then it's not unreasonable that the fans might start crying foul. Likewise, if the artist becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">raging egomaniacal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">tool</a> who believes that they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader">treat their fans like dirt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">don't need to listen to their critics or higher ups</a>, things might go downhill fast. Perhaps their fame rises <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment">beyond a level they can cope with</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a> could possibly become an issue if the new crop of fans fundamentally misses the point of the work and latches on for all the wrong reasons. The new fans may also bring along a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> if they are rabidly devoted to the artist or work to the point where they are constantly starting fights with anyone who criticizes the work (no matter how reasonable) or, worse, who doesn't like the work "enough", which often means starting trouble with older fans. On another, more subjective note, the popularity and acclaim of an actually solid artist or work may rise to hyperbolic, unwarranted heights, which can have a negative effect if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">the hype cannot possibly match the reality</a>. Where live performances are involved, larger, less intimate venues will generally be required - perhaps a situation in which the performers don&#146;t come across so well - and audience demographics may change, the newcomers behaving differently to the older fans, causing an overall change in atmosphere. The live shows themselves may change - acts that used to be known for their energy and spontaneity may move towards a heavily produced and choreographed live show that focuses more on spectacle than actual performances, and may become so reliant on backing tracks (especially if vocal pitch correction or outright lipsyncing is involved) that it becomes a hollow and artificial experience. Production values may also change - acts who rely on a more stripped-down, raw aesthetic may wind up switching to a cleaner, more polished production style, which can be a jarring shift that very well may be incongruous with the work's style. And finally, some things <em>are</em> better in small doses, in which case the last thing you want is to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">over-exposed to it</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>However, in too many cases, the cry of "It's Popular, Now It Sucks!" is more about snobbery than anything else. The fandom itself becomes what economists call a "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/the-economics-of-political-correctness">positional good<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>." When the artist is a small name or a cult favorite, being one of their fans feels like being in an exclusive little club, but once membership has been opened up to the 'sheep', the original fans may feel a lot less special. Alternatively, some critics seem to enjoy the attention that comes from criticizing something popular, or feeling more intelligent and superior about being the only ones capable of possessing the high standards not to "follow the herd". Some also seem to believe that artists should work and create art <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">solely for the sake of art</a>, without consideration of anything so uncouth as critical, popular or especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">financial reward -- forgetting (or perhaps not even realizing) artists still need to put food on the table and pay rent</a>. (There's an ugly undercurrent of class snobbery to this attitude, a usually unspoken assumption that a "real" artist wouldn't <em>need</em> the money.) In these cases, it might be more accurate to say that when these fans say the creator should create art 'for the sake of art', what they actually mean is that the creator should create art 'for the sake of my ego'.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In either case, this elitist tendency essentially turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fandom">Fandom</a> into a speculations market &mdash; if you like it before it's popular, or if you hate something because it's popular, only then does your profit margin in coolness points amount to anything when you fling away your shares in the fandom in horror of the masses. (Incidentally, note the jargon here. "Speculations market". "Profit margin". "Shares". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Ironic, no?</a>) If it never Sells Out, no one will get the name recognition when you say "I liked X before it was popular." Ironically, fandoms of little-known works almost always expand by word of mouth &mdash; <em>the very reason it became popular</em> is that these people kept talking about how cool it was, and enjoying acclaim from being the one "in the know" about a good work before anyone else. (Which they lose when it becomes popular.) For further irony value, these snobs often claim to be X's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">original and/</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">or true fans</a> &mdash; but, in dropping X like a hot potato after X becomes popular, they actually reveal themselves to be fair weather fans (or, if you prefer, foul weather fans), since if they truly were a fan of X, then they would be supportive of X regardless of its popularity.
</p><p>As you can see on the quote, sometimes people only just trash something that's popular because they want to be accepted by their peers - you'd be surprised how many people actually <em>do</em> trash stuff that's popular may have only read an opinion leader's review no matter how flawed and marred with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a>.
</p><p>A variant of this trope is the cry that "It's Popular, <strong>so</strong> it Sucks". To these people, the only way a work can become popular is by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">dumb, "safe" and middle-of-the-road</a>, and therefore mediocre. (Sometimes however, lesser known works are prone to criticism for some people simply by virtue of obscurity, believing that anything that isn't mainstream is "too weird". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QualityByPopularVote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QualityByPopularVote">However that's another story entirely</a>. It might inspire backlash of this kind.) At the extreme end are the people who like something obscure, then denounce it when it so much as becomes visible by the mainstream, even the parts they liked before. Unlike the people who claim they "liked X before it was popular," these people claim that they never liked it in the first place or consider it an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>. To <em>these</em> people, they get into obscure or impenetrable things <em>because</em> they are obscure or impenetrable to deliberately cultivate an image (or a collective image), or to distance themselves from the "sheep" as much as possible.
</p><p>Many of these works that get this tend to get subjected to the fallacy that "the more mainstream something is, the more critical people are of it." High profile works in particular are prone to getting picked apart, while lesser known works are looked on much more favorably, with their flaws mostly overlooked, or perhaps even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow">granted immunity to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnacceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnacceptableTargets">any form of criticism</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">in any way</a>.

(More thorough translation, they actually <em>know</em> how to pronounce Kaneda's name, and the fact that the 80s dub got a PG-13 rating thanks in part to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> while the 2001 redub is rated R...)

Back then, any and all feedback were about how frickin' awesome it was, and how it's a shame that it's so obscure and no-named. And <em>then</em>, it got big. It's amazing how many countless people (including the fans who liked it back when it was small) have changed their tone to "I hate <em>Bleach</em>, it sucks because it's popular."

Dub argument aside, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> in general has fallen victim to this. Back when it was new, <em>Death Note</em> was the greatest series in years, all the cool kids liked it, and making references to <em>Death Note</em> was the best way to flaunt your otaku elitism. Then the anime came along and <em>Death Note</em> became super-popular, and so now the trendy thing among the otaku elite is bashing it and making fun of all the stupid <em>Death Note</em> fanspawn.

The return of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> also brought back many of the last generation of fans.

Then when people realized everyone was watching it (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> dubbed version), it became trendy to bash it for being "kiddie" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWomenDontWearDresses">sexist</a>.

Since then, many fans of modest shoujo avoid it like the plague due to its rampant popularity at the time.

Over time, it emerged as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a> and with the airing of the anime has become one of the most popular series around.

As a result of this, the show received an incredibly huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> at the expense of people who tried to interpret in a negative way almost any little thing in the work to prove to everyone that it "was not as gorgeous and revolutionary as you all say!". And in a more narrow example, part of the show's own fans, distanced themselves from Rem as a heroine, blaming her fans for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> and complaining that because of her popularity, most of the series' products were devoted to her, despite the fact that she was not even the main character.

</li><li> Every fan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhonenVasquez">Jhonen Vasquez</a>'s comics (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnnyTheHomicidalManiac">Johnny the Homicidal Maniac</a></em>) from "back in the day" seems to hate and look down on fans who found out about Jhonen's work through his cartoon show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>, a show that &mdash; being a cartoon on a big name children's cable channel &mdash; was accessible to a <em>much</em> larger and more varied audience than his early comics.
</li><li> The comic community site Scans Daily seems to have a rule of "the more mainstream it is, the more critical we are." High-profile events in particular seem to be prone to getting picked apart, while lesser known comics are looked on much more favorably. As a general rule if your stuff is smaller or more underground the community will like it, but heaven help you if you get to write an A-list character. A prime example is Dan Slott, whose Spider-Man work, which is generally well received by critics and fans, couldn't be ripped to shreds fast enough. On the other hand one would think that Slott's Silver Surfer work was the greatest thing since sliced bread according to SD. The difference? Spider-Man consistently sold in the better than most, while Silver Surfer was middling at best.
</li><li> Some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> (and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">himself</a>) began sneering at the thought of someone reading the comic because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">the movie</a>. And it happened as the trailers caused the comic to become a top-seller again. Good for the comic, bad for Moore (who doesn't make a cent off of Watchmen due to licensing.)

<ul><li> Disney animation often gets this treatment due to its influence and dominance in the animation world. Some, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>, see Disney as only creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> tendencies amongst competitors which discourages diversity in animated filmmaking.
<ul><li> A lot of Disney movies from the animated canon get this effect; while some of the most obscure and less popular movies (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron">The Black Cauldron</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet">Treasure Planet</a></em>) are praised wildly, Disney's most popular films (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">The Lion King</a></em> is a prime example) suddenly get bashed for their unevenness and plot issues, though this seems to be dying down. One of these successful Disney films, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>, has been subjected to this trope. The movie gets this treatment <em>hard</em> from the young male demographic. Quite a few males enjoy the movie anyway, or at least parts of it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0u89t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0u89t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0u89t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Elsa is a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestosteroneBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestosteroneBrigade">Testosterone Brigade</a> magnet, and Kristoff, Olaf, and other characters were made to appeal to them (and younger boys) directly.</span> However, you're also likely to find men who originally ignored <em>Frozen</em> due to it just being another good-quality Disney princess movie that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto">not really for them</a>, but began to resent it as it became the colossal juggernaut of a success that it is now.

<ul><li> One small group of people was particularly turned off of it: When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/AustinPowers">pinball machine</a> came out in 2001, the existing pinball fans at the time, by and large, <em>loathed</em> the Austin Powers movies and were baffled as to how it became so popular (or would rather pretend it was never popular in the first place). Reviews of the pinball machine often cited the theme as a reason why it's bad with no further explanation, under the assumption that you, the reader, must hate the movies too.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zqof');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1zqof" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zqof');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There were many other reasons why this pinball machine was bad though: It had poor build quality, disorganized rules, low-resolution art, and cacophonous sound balancing.</span> That being said, pinball, by then, was aimed at a much older audience than the Austin Powers movies.
</li></ul></li><li> Look at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>, or really any popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">Superhero</a> film from the last decade or so. Chances are, you will find vocal fans of the source material that absolutely <em>hate</em> the publicity and popularity the franchise has received in light of getting a movie adaptation. For instance, it's not uncommon to hear Marvel fans complaining about how they have to put up with a bunch of kids and "fangirls" because of the popularity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">MCU</a>.
<ul><li> Some complain because the popularity of the MCU has affected the comic universe. Now Nick Fury has been replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Nick Fury, Jr.</a>, whose name wasn't even Nick Fury initially, but he is Fury's illegitimate son, and also half-black, meaning they can have a counterpart to the Samuel L. Jackson version from the films. For that matter, the Hulk has rejoined the team after decades of hating them, and Phil Coulson has officially become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">canon immigrant</a>.
</li><li> Some audiences grew to dislike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superhero</a> movie genre for its overwhelming popularity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>. While there are only 6-10 superhero movies released per year, their high profitability means that they dominate much of the popular discourse and end up receiving the bulk of studio marketing and theater screens at the expense of other films. The relative popularity of superhero movies have frustrated some critics and filmmakers, most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, for overshadowing other genre films and making it more difficult to green-light smaller theatrical films.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasStory">A Christmas Story</a></em> suffers this, largely due to over-exposure from the 24-hour marathon of the movie that's run every year at or around Christmas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> has suffered this. Considering it's the 12th highest-grossing movie of all time, it seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">the higher the popularity, the higher the suck.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em> managed to avoid this, if only because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s movie was so massively hyped and generated so much controversy that it was bound to attract the interest of everyone, whether they liked it or not. As near as one can tell, <em>Batman</em> energized three very large, vocal and/or influential sectors of the viewing public: young adults, who delighted in Burton's "hipster" aesthetic and edgy humor; film critics (most of them older people) who were offended or even outraged by that same edginess and only watched the movie because it was so huge they just couldn't ignore it; and hardcore Batman fans, who were just so thrilled to finally get to see a true cinematic treatment of their hero that they didn't really care (or at least didn't care too much) that Burton's take was so radically different. (Incidentally, <em>Batman</em> ended up attracting a surprise fourth demographic: children, many of whom thought the movie was a lot of fun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">even though it was intended primarily for adults</a>.) Generally, It's Popular Now It Sucks only applies to works that enjoy a <em>moderately</em> high level of popularity. If a work becomes <em>insanely</em> popular, as <em>Batman</em> did in '89, it turns into a phenomenon so awesome that no amount of backlash can truly hurt it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em>, when it suddenly went from being a brilliant-but-weird movie that was buried in obscurity after 9/11, to a massive cult phenomenon that every teenager has seen. Somewhat ironic, in that it mostly became popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">via word-of-mouth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable">Vindicated by Cable</a>.

</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s next film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> received a similar treatment. After the initial wave of glowing praise, the film garnered its fair share of detractors. The main reasons given by viewers who dislike the film are one or more of the following: it's too complex, it's not as complex as everyone makes it out to be, it plays with an idea but doesn't develop it, there are (or seem to be) contradictions within the film regarding the "rules" of dreaming and that it attempts to pander to an action film fanbase with its spectacle, slighting fans of serious cyber punk science fiction and psychological thriller films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em> was initially a relatively small-time indie film with limited release. It skyrocketed from cult hit to mainstream success seemingly overnight, and endless merchandising and commercialization of its catchphrases changed a lot of opinions just as quickly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a> has made many critically acclaimed films, but it seems that to many on the Internet and even on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">the more viewers his films get, the worse the film is</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic (1997)</a></em> at first actually got a decent amount of public and critical acclaim. The backlash set in both after it was clear it was going to make hundreds of millions, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> came out, and the loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Oscar nominations and wins</a> it got. At the same time, it was subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> by people who consider the film flash over substance; a series of well-done set pieces offset by cardboard cutout characters.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> came out, it had a skyrocket of public acclaim and defining the standard of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie">3-D Movie</a>, with many proclaiming 'Oh man, Avatar was awesome!', only for about a few months later when it became the highest-grossing film of all time, a huge hatedom came out and proclaimed it as one of the worst films of all time while quite a few of its fandom changed their mind and stated 'Yeah, it's just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">in space</a>'. Conversely, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHurtLocker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHurtLocker">The Hurt Locker</a></em>; which was directed by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftForDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftForDead">Left for Dead</a> as a box office flop until somehow, it came out of nowhere around awards time to huge critical acclaim, with many proclaiming, <em>'Avatar</em> is Lame. This is Best Picture right here'. Its momentum would be enough to upset and punch out <em>Avatar</em> at the Oscars and the BAFTAs, including the Best Picture award for both (and making it the lowest-grossing film of all time to win Best Picture), leaving <em>Avatar</em> to only beat <em>Hurt Locker</em> in the Golden Globes. For extra irony, in the wake of Avatar becoming the new highest grossing movie, it actually started to become trendy to <em>like</em> Titanic again. The one thing <em>everyone</em> agrees on with <em>Avatar</em> though - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">the visuals are incredible</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArtist">The Artist</a></em> suddenly got this. Despite winning over 13 Best Picture awards from various critics groups, the Golden Globes, the BAFTA, and the Oscars, plus a 97% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score, the film is now considered as overrated and not the best film of the year by some people.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a>. Some fans have accused him of being a sell out, a label he has no problem with.

This, despite the fact that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">took a significant pay ''cut'' to ensure the film could have the R-rating he thought it deserved.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">The Collector's Edition</a> contains a meta-example. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateDVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateDVDCommentary">alternate commentaries</a> in it are explained as existing because every other DVD commentary is always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the cast and crew commenting on the development of the film</a>, and a film like theirs deserves commentaries by college philosophers and movie critics instead.
</li><li> The sequels suffered from this because of the first movie's massive popularity. It made such a significant impact on pop culture that practically every action movie made between 1999 and 2003 ripped off its special effects and cinematography (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ResidentEvil">and some movies are still doing it even today!</a>), to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">the two follow-ups were seen as painfully derivative and unoriginal</a> by the time they finally came out.

Full swing after making the movie adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. You'd be amazed at how many of his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">fans</a>" despise the fact he made a film that cost more than a million or so and look down on fans that were brought into the fold via <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. Claims that he "sold out", "lost his touch", and "became a hack" are common in certain circles of his older fanbase. Not that he catches a break from those who became his fans <em>because</em> of <em>Lord of the Rings</em>; a widespread criticism of Jackson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005">King Kong (2005)</a></em> was that it was very long (a Jackson hallmark), presumably because he'd become so popular he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a>.
<ul><li> Immediately once the credits began rolling at the first screening of <em>The Return of the King</em>, fans began screaming for him to make a <em>Hobbit</em> movie. The legal battles that ensued, when it seemed that a movie would be made but Jackson would be denied the opportunity to direct, had fans frothing at the mouth at the very idea that someone else would be allowed to direct this movie. Finally, Jackson was announced as director, and fans were happy...until he started actually making them and it turned out he wanted to make two (later three) movies. Cries of "he's become a hack", "he's blinded by greed", "he doesn't get Tolkien", etc. started being shouted well before we saw any footage. The actual movies themselves have been widely accused of being too populist, being too focused on homages to the original trilogy, etc. In other words "Jackson's too popular, the original series is too popular, these movies will be too popular, so they suck, and so does he."

</li><li> While many <em>claimed</em> this was happening with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> (as shown by the current page image), the reality is that it never seems to have been anything more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a>, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutComplaining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutComplaining">there seemed to be more people complaining about this trope than actually practicing it</a>. In particular, the articles claiming that Trekkies hated the film for having good special effects and writing reeked of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">The War on Straw</a>. That&#146;s not to say it didn&#146;t happen at all; there most definitely were some who feared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">the franchise</a> was being dumbed down for the sake of reaching a wider audience, but it was hardly the universal opinion many portrayed it as.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, despite being mostly an aversion when it first released, has suffered through this, especially when the prequels came out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> had his reputation take a nosedive. Some film snobs have gone as far as blaming the popularity of <em>Star Wars</em> for killing off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewHollywood">New Hollywood</a> era as the franchise's success convinced studio executives to bankroll movies based on their ability to generate money through sequels and merchandising. And now that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> is one of the top-grossing films for the year (adjusted for inflation, only the 1977 film in the series has made more), combined with Disney having thrown away the rich history a la "de-canonized" the old EU, it's worse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>. Early in his career, he gained a cult following, most of his early films did well, but not huge numbers at the box office. However, as his films became more popular, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> grew and grew, in large part due to his popularity with the Goth and Emo crowd, and much because of this trope. It seems to be mostly due to the misconception that he and his movies are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">whiny, mopey, self-indulgent</a> navel-gazers, missing the part where he's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">pretty funny</a> and doesn't take himself that seriously at all.

"Could you roll the I.V. in here? I'm feeling a bit...faint."
</li><li> Certain parts of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> fandom, over the year or so before the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">the 2007 live-action movie</a>, preemptively expressed the sentiment that "It's going to be popular! That sucks!" Everyone else was rather confused. It becomes very silly when people accuse <em>Transformers</em>, a franchise that was created specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">to sell toys</a>, of selling out. <br><br>This being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> fandom, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> if ever there was one, there's also a very vocal segment that runs counter to this trope, and cheered every time it topped charts. Transformers is somewhat a subversion as more fans were happy with the movies success as it made the franchise relevant again in the eyes of the public. More relevance means more plastic (and even better, more <em>die-cast metal</em>), which has always made 'True Fans' happy even if they despised the related series.
</li><li> On the other hand, part of the reason why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em> purists hate the movies so much is because of their popularity; they're pissed that more people are familiar with the CGI Transformers starring in big, dumb action movies than their original, detailed cartoon incarnations. (Fans of more widely praised incarnations such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> also react this way if they dislike the movies).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a> is an extreme example of this for actors. After years of toiling away in often-quirky roles in mainstream and off-the-wall fare to frequent critical acclaim, he parlayed his eccentric stylings into 2003's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</a></em>, and became one of the biggest movie stars in the world. In the ensuing ten years, he reprised the role of Jack Sparrow three times and played similarly outre characters in other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummerBlockbuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummerBlockbuster">Summer Blockbuster</a>-style fare; two of the <em>Pirates</em> films and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010">Alice in Wonderland (2010)</a></em> pulled down $1 billion apiece. Critics effectively went into mourning as the smaller projects he used to alternate big films with have dwindled, seeing him as "squandering" his talent on mindless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a> fare. North American audiences ultimately tired of him in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> as those movies and his roles in them grew stale (with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a> status the death knell). His ex-wife Amber Heard falsely accusing him of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> in 2016 made matters <em>much</em> worse &mdash; though he remains popular internationally, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> filmmakers have received a lot of criticism from the <em>Harry Potter</em> fandom for not recasting his role with someone who doesn't have his personal baggage.
</li><li> Inverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TRON" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TRON">TRON</a></em>, which received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">Colbert Bump</a> due to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>. The TRON fandom was actually quite accepting of the newcomers.

<ul><li> Often inverted for Gluten-Free diets. Outside of places like California or Boulder, CO, if you had a gluten allergy in the 90s...good luck finding gluten-free stuff outside of expensive specialty stores or health food stores! Now that Gluten-free diet has become a fad diet (or that people are actually more aware of Gluten-free diets), those with Gluten allergies can actually go <em>out to eat</em> more often and actually <em>not</em> have to shop at expensive health food stores. (Course, those are <em>still</em> the best places to go if you have a gluten allergy, but still.) Unfortunately, this also comes with a downside: it can sometimes be difficult to convince the waiter that, yes, you actually do have the allergy and aren't doing this for the fun of it, and can they <em>actually be careful</em> with your food. However other fad diets this has played through, some of them aren't actually <em>meant</em> to be taken seriously and are often misunderstood. (i.e. Atkins isn't eating nothing but meat forever and ever, and the Grapefruit Diet isn't eating <em>just</em> grapefruit.. It's eating grapefruit <em>before</em> each meal)
</li><li> One easily noticeable trait among food enthusiasts is their total disdain for any chain restaurant. Chain restaurants get noticeably worse reviews on sites like Yelp than local restaurants. They might make an exception for regional chains like In-N-Out Burger or admit begrudgingly to liking some chains as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasures">Guilty Pleasure</a>. Some take it a step further and badmouth even local non-chain eateries that are popular and/or have attractive signs and architecture to bring in the curious. The most extreme eat from a single small and nondescript place that's hard to notice and nowhere else, and deride other food enthusiasts for eating anywhere else. However, there is another group that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverts this phenomenon</a>: chain restaurant fans, who by and large ignore local restaurants, embracing It's Unpopular, So It Sucks.
</li><li> In the specialty coffee world, admitting to liking Starbucks is the same as admitting to cannibalism.
</li><li> Pretty prevalent among beer enthusiasts&mdash;it's as if the quality of the beer is inversely proportional to how much beer the company makes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2wx0j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2wx0j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2wx0j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Justified in that, like any mass-produced product, it's at least as important to produce something consistent as something good, and creating large volumes of anything means you have to be less picky about the raw materials that go into it.</span> Also, for the more hardcore cases, if the beer maker does so much as create an advertisement or license its name, the beer automatically becomes garbage&mdash;good beers spread through word-of-mouth alone. There is also some justification for this when a micro is acquired by a large macrobrewer - increased volume, the shifting of personnel, and the relocation of production facilities all tend to lead to a drop in quality, not to mention the potential for the production of poor-quality new beers to cash in on a trend, or gimmick beers that were likely produced more for their marketing potential than for their quality.
</li><li> Justified for most wines. Producing good wine depends on a combination of the land, the vines, and the care taken by the vintners; there are ways to increase yield and speed production to meet increased demand, but these almost always mean sacrificing some measure of the quality of the final product.
</li><li> It's hard to find any carnivore who doesn't love chicken wings. It's very easy, on the other hand, to find people who hate the massive explosion in popularity for the things that began in the late 90's, because it took what used to be the absolute cheapest part of the bird and drove prices through the roof, where they've remained ever since.

Then, about the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> came out, its popularity skyrocketed, the movies received stellar reviews from critics and audiences alike, and a small but incredibly vocal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a> led by an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster">Hipsters</a> rose up.

The widely disliked movies certainly didn't help.
</li><li> This happened to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> with the massive turnout for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a></em> &mdash; many "fans" assumed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J.

However, they didn't so much drop the fandom as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">stick around to complain about everything</a>, thus proving their worth as True Fans. Happened to a lesser extent with the influx of new fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">the film</a> brought, but the fact that most of them read the books anyway reassured the original fanbase somewhat.
<ul><li> It has slowly started to happen to one of its characters. Not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the protagonist</a>, Harry Potter himself, as one would guess, but to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a>, Draco Malfoy, to the point that some say that the only reason he is popular is because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomFelton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomFelton">the actor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">who</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">played him</a>.

Many "old-school" fans consider the movie lovers shallow and frivolous, <em>especially</em> if said movie lovers were subsequently turned on to the books by the movies. In one way at least it was quite relevant that older fans of the books hated the success of the movies- it made buying replacements for your now venerable and worn copies extraordinarily expensive. The books went from being $10~$15 each ($35 for the set including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>) to $20~30 PER BOOK. As with most major movie merchandising, every older print of the book suddenly disappeared, only to be replaced with new editions with oversized, tie-in covers....and that's only the LotR books themselves. Tolkien's books had always had a great deal of secondary literature (books about the books), even a few written by J.R.R. or Christopher Tolkien, but after the movies came out? Merchandising mayhem.

But that's nothing compared to the dismissive attitude they have toward fans of the TV show that have yet to read the books. They refer to them as "Unsullied" and speak of them the way you'd speak of particularly immature children.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> has gained a substantial hatedom merely because of how insanely popular the books are among young girls. This is especially true among fans of traditional horror stories and vampire stories, who will often yell "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourVampiresSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourVampiresSuck">Your Vampires Suck</a>!" due to its portrayal of vampires as brooding, beautiful, sparkly, baseball-playing teenagers. The character of Bella and the nature of her relationship with Edward has also garnered lots of criticism, as well as its retrograde views toward women.

The increased ratings could be attributed to more popular guests, more homes with cable/satellite, and Jamie Spears. The decreased reputation could be attributed to a change in the tone of the show, the complete replacement of all the old actors and writers, and Jamie Spears.

As the show increased in popularity they have needed to do more of their farcical stunts overseas, where they are not so well known. As a result of this, many of their older fans are getting bored of them and jumping ship, so to speak. This hasn't stopped a good chunk of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">complaining</a> that the show is ending after its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity">3rd Season</a>.

<ul><li> The classic series was for a long time very popular, becoming something of a national institution in its home country. By the time of its cancellation, however, it had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">for</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut">numerous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">reasons</a> become something of a cult show, something which only intensified with the development of the largely fan-driven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> media. When the new series came along and restored the show to its former popularity a certain subsection of these fans, having apparently forgotten that its period of being a cult was the exception rather than the intention, seemed to be convinced that the show's newfound popularity was a bad thing and that it should have remained the cult relic cherished only by a few fans and mocked by everyone else. Whilst the new series is significantly different in style and tone from the old series in many ways, thus generating plenty of legitimate criticism for numerous reasons, a significant portion of the critical response to the new version does seem to be comprised of people who are upset that it's not "theirs" anymore.
</li><li> There have been several people who have criticized the new show as being this, namely that it's become too big for its own good. Some have noticed that ever since the show went from "popular in Britain with cult audiences elsewhere" to "massively popular in multiple markets," some people think there's been a slight downturn in quality. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/doctor-who-amy-pond_b_1924022.html?utm_hp_ref=doctor-who">Some have theorized<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that, since the show has become a worldwide success and therefore made the BBC a lot of money, they've been deliberately simplifying the stories to make them easier to translate and therefore easier to promote and export.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> times a million. To be fair, the back nine episodes are quite uneven, but plenty of people were hating on it before the season even officially started because the pilot was shown at the beginning of the summer of 2009, kicking off an extremely aggressive and relentless ad campaign by Fox (the most amusing facet of which was when they came up with the term "Gleeks" and then tried to pretend that hardcore fans had christened themselves that).
</li><li> This can also cross over with music elitism, too, since there are many people who despise <em>Glee</em> for the simple fact that it causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">surge in popularity</a> for whatever classic rock songs are features in a given episode.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> was relatively low key, especially in the online fandom.

</li><li> This seems to be happening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh">The Mighty Boosh</a></em>. Many original fans have complained the latest series is too mainstream and lacking in invention. Whether there's been an actual drop in quality is debatable.
</li><li> There seems to be a substantial backlash of this sort to anything by the legendary comedy group <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a></em>, (especially, however, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>).

For comparison, the fifth season's average viewers (19,800,000) was 600,000 more than that of the preceding fourth season (19,200,000), the latter included its highest rated episode ("Leonard Betts"). Its Nielsen ratings rank declined after the fifth season.

Interestingly, each wave of popularity leads to a status increase for past newcomers, to the point where "Goldies" (newcomers after the release of the "ABBA Gold" album), who were ridiculed on their arrival, are now praised as "true fans" by the older fans who criticized them. Many of these older fans ignore the fact that they first liked the band in the 1970's, at the all-time peak of their success and popularity.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> has managed to avoid this for the most part, but there is still a portion of the fandom that believes the band was better before Brian Johnson replaced the deceased Bon Scott on vocals, simply because of the massive success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackInBlack">Back in Black</a></em> (still the second best selling album of all time to this day) which was the first album to feature Johnson.
</li><li> Against Me! not only got this, but their fans got outright hostile about it. Fans claimed the band sold out when they moved from the tiny No Idea label to Fat Wreck Chords in 2003, to the point where fans slashed the tires of the bands tour van and vandalized it and reportedly poured bleach over their merch table. The bizarre thing is that Fat Wreck Chords was well known for being anti-establishment indie label. Ironically, there was a lot less outcry when the band left FWC for an actual major label, Sire Records in 2007.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllTimeLow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllTimeLow">All Time Low</a> got this treatment starting from "Nothing Personal" in 2009, although it got better with the release of "Don't Panic".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax">Anthrax</a> was accused of selling out when they chose John Bush as their new lead singer and with their more mainstream-sounding album, <em>Sounds of White Noise</em>. The band's rhythm guitarist, Scott Ian, commented on this in an interview saying, "The bottom line is, everyone in this business is in it to make money. Myself included." They also got this treatment when they dared to commit the unforgivable crime of trying to give fans of different genres some common ground when they did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapMetal">Rap Metal</a> project with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicEnemy">Public Enemy</a>.
</li><li> The Arctic Monkeys' EP <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Who The Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys</a></em> was designed specifically to stop the band from falling victim to this trope by being unlikely to be played on mainstream radio (due to the profanity in the title), and deliberately ineligible for either the single chart (due to containing five different tracks) or the album chart (due to its length).
<ul><li> After the release of <em>AM</em> (which bought a massive amount of new fans), many people have accused the band of becoming "americanized" due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">slick haircuts, suits and stage presence</a> which they feel is a betrayal of their original image of humble, shy teenagers.

<ul><li> One of the few artists to be both massively popular <em>and</em> adored by critics.

Plus, their massive success and influence and having stood the test of time more than most musicians is used to claim that they are overrated. Additionally, a number of people find it cool to hate The Beatles by dismissing them as a 60s pop group. Y'know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">not putting them in the context of the 60s and realizing all the things they helped to make popular</a>, not least the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutPeopleNotLikingTheShow">sheer timelessness of stuff like ''Rubber Soul'' and ''Revolver''</a>.

</li><li> Similarly, some of those who take this attitude don't even provide or consider the "'60s" qualifier and just compare them to whatever current pop act they don't like or which happens to be at the top of the charts, without any consideration for how 1960s popular music and contemporary popular music might be different. This one tends to work both ways, however, with subscribers to this trope who happen to like the Beatles often driven to paroxysms of fury that anyone might <em>dare</em> consider or compare the Beatles to a 'mere' pop group &mdash; despite the fact that, at least early in their career, this is arguably a fair comparison in many ways.

The popularity of their song "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" as a result of it forming the centrepiece of the popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> skit "More Cowbell" has seen something of an injection of new fans based on this song &mdash; much to the irritation of the existing fans, who feel that the band's other songs are being overlooked in the process.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobSeger">Bob Seger</a> after he allowed his song "Like a Rock" to be featured in Chevrolet commercials. Never mind the reason he did it; Chevrolet is owned by General Motors, which is headquartered in Seger's hometown of Detroit. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, and Seger had a lot of friends who worked for them. Not wanting those friends to be out of jobs, Seger allowed the song to be used, and it saved the company.

It got worse when his next two albums (<em>Tonight</em> and <em>Never Let Me Down</em>) followed in that vein to diminishing returns, thanks in part to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicIsPolitics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicIsPolitics">pressure from his record label</a>. As well, when he tried to merge his latest sound and stadium venues with the visual stylings and older tunes of previous tours for the Glass Spider Tour of 1987, he sold a lot of tickets but found that audiences didn't appreciate his efforts while critics called them overblown. Bowie, now far wealthier than he'd been in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> but dissatisfied with his work and risking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment">Artist Disillusionment</a>, chose to move on &mdash; first to the unsuccessful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock">Hard Rock</a> group Tin Machine and then to solo work that was driven more by art than commerce.

Fans at first praised its inclusion, and it would seem that this trope was averted. Then the game came out, and the cries of "Sellout!" came with it. Seriously, just go on to any video of the band on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, either their music videos, their live performances, or their interviews and count how many comments read along the lines of "I liked Dragon Force before <em>Guitar Hero.</em>

Among other things, people think that the world of electronic music has become over-commercialized with a focus on big-budget festivals and artists having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a>, the previously underground world of electronic music being overrun with new "fans" using "EDM" as a catch-all term for a number of genres (particularly progressive house) because they do not know all the specific sub-genres, people whose only exposure to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dubstep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dubstep">dubstep</a>" have been the significantly harder styles of names such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Skrillex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Skrillex">Skrillex</a>, "big room" tracks that suffer from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i0tj4k6IZY">a lack of real differentiation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and fans who straight-up do not actually give a fuck about the music and view shows as an opportunity to do as many drugs as possible and nothing more. When Hardwell usurped Armin van Buuren as the #1 "DJ" on the DJMag Top 100, people <em>knew</em> something was wrong.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Evanescence</a>. When they began to take off, fans were in denial that the band had hit the Lycos 50 (yes, you read right, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">search engine results</a></em>!), even though their only album before <em>Fallen</em> was <em>Origin</em>, a glorified demo tape.

Many fans think that the quality of the albums are negatively proportional to how popular they are, which would mean essentially that they haven't done anything good since "Take This To Your Grave"...or "From Under The Cork Tree", if they're feeling charitable.

Thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>, they are a textbook example of this trope. If you want to see someone have an aneurysm, just ask a fan of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> era what he/she thinks of the <em>Invisible Touch</em> album. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanPsycho">Wall Street psychopaths</a> like that song.
<ul><li> Much of the backlash against the group very likely was a product of the backlash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a> received in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, as his popularity and visibility increased through the decade. It was difficult to escape Phil at the time, between his session work, solo albums, Genesis, his hit movie themes, acting work and numerous charity concert appearances (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LiveAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LiveAid">Live Aid</a> especially).

Even older fans of "old school" punk rock, who complained about Green Day commercializing the genre and watering it down for the masses.
</li><li> Cries of "sell out" were also heard the previous decade, once they signed with a major label and released <em>Dookie</em> - which committed the extra sin of selling 10 million copies in the US alone!

Since they'd already had 5 years under their belt, they managed to score a very favourable record contract that allowed them control over their recordings and the ability to organise their own shows. Regardless, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> came fast and furious: one particularly psychotic fan wrote to the band <strong>wishing for their death in a fiery van accident</strong>.

Once the initial rush of what was effectively his high school garage band filling up function halls several states away and blowing up all over MySpace before taking him across the world just a few years after forming had worn off, he began to feel that they had gotten way too big way too fast without really having earned it. Co-headlining with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Behemoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Behemoth">Behemoth</a> and being billed above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HateEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HateEternal">Hate Eternal</a> with just one album was a particularly big sore spot for him, as he loved both bands and felt that he should have had to pay his dues supporting them. This also led to their collective decision to abandon the deathcore genre; <em>Doom</em> fast became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a> for them, as none of them particularly liked deathcore and hated that they had blown up because of it, and they all decided that they would rather play death metal and risk losing their status and having to get day jobs than play a genre that they didn't care for just so they could make a living off of their music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a>, particularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, was a very successful and high-profile entertainer with multiple demographics and a larger-than-life image. His albums sold astronomically and/or had rave reviews, his tendency for flamboyance was at an all-time high, and he always seemed to be in the news or creating controversy with his outspokenness or humor. High-profile friendships with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Billie Jean King</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a> also gave him notoriety, along with his ownership/management of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">British soccer club Watford F.C.</a> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">appearance</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who's</a> 1975 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical">rock musical</a> adaption of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy">Tommy</a></em> as the "Local Lad" in "Pinball Wizard" was considered <em>the</em> highlight of the movie, and Elton's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">cover of the song</a> outsold the original. The critics' reviews and his treatment in the press <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash">seriously declined</a> with "Elton Mania", and he was denounced as a "one handed piano player", "disposable" and "bland soft-rocker". Similarly to Phil Collins, this may have led to much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalBacklash">Critical Backlash</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> against him by the end of that decade (middling albums and his outing in 1976 didn't help. Although he had major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">comebacks</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, often they were led by equal levels of backlash as his profile increased.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a> has gotten a double dose of this trope:
<ul><li> Most millennials know this band only through one song, due to unending drunken singalong renditions of "Don't Stop Believin'" and its continual use in movies and TV throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The2000s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The2000s">The 2000s</a>. As a result, the band has entered mainstream pop culture as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> with a widespread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">camp</a> status that really has nothing to do with how they present themselves. Any irritated Generation X fan of the band will tell you that <em>Journey</em> was far better off as a just another memorable old school band instead of becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnthem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnthem">National Anthem</a> for drunken happy hour. However...
</li><li> Those irritated Generation X fans forget that Journey was the epitome of the "It's Popular, <strong>so</strong> it Sucks" variant all through its heyday in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, after Journey changed from artsy psychedelic rock to pop rock with their fourth album, <em>Infinity</em>. Critics and rock magazines such as <em>Creem</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/RollingStone">Rolling Stone</a></em> despised the band because it was so popular, labelling them as faceless corporate sellouts for decades until Journey was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>. Journey themselves often complained about the label in interviews, with lead singer Steve Perry stating "We gotta pay bills, we gotta pay taxes, and we gotta eat. And we enjoy eating as much as anybody", in the band's only interview with Rolling Stone.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a>: Many of the people that supported him when he made videos on YouTube abandoned him when he ascended superstardom at the turn of the New Tens. Now his hatedom greatly outsizes his fandom.
</li><li> Kings of Leon after <em>Only By The Night</em>. Many of their fans who followed them throughout their first few albums felt that particularly "Sex On Fire" was an uninspired sellout compared to their earlier work. It evidently turned several off them, as neither 5th album <em>Come Around Sundown</em> and its accompanying single "Radioactive" were as much of a critical or commercial success.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> to some extent, though the real irony is that the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">self-admitted,</a> entire reason for existence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">was to sell a look and style on the road</a> and not so much their <em>songs</em>.
</li><li> Lene Marlin. The Norwegian singer had a huge success in Italy and Japan (of all places!) with her first album, <em>Playing my game</em>. Released with little fanfare, the album was not technically exquisite, but most fans loved it anyway and thought of it as simple yet made with passion &mdash; music for the sake of itself, rather than in the pursuit of the holy dollar. As a result it was a surprise hit, and good times were had by all. Then year 2003 came along, and with it the highly anticipated release of the second album, <em>Another Day</em>. Cue many of the fans (the most outspoken ones, usually) lamenting sore disappointment that Lene had sold out, that while the quality of the music had improved that of the lyrics had plummeted, that the album had been written to cash in on the success of her name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlahBlahBlah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlahBlahBlah">Blah Blah Blah</a>. The third album, <em>Lost in a moment</em>, was unsurprisingly met with even more bashing. Fourth album's now out, <em>Twist the truth</em>. An experimental album, it was unsurprisingly met with cries of "it's too different!" by the same people who used to complain that Lene's music was always the same.
</li><li> Many fans of the Canadian singer Lights became less keen on her when she started to gain publicity and become something of a darling of the hipster music circles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LimpBizkit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LimpBizkit">Limp Bizkit</a> and the whole <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal">Nu Metal</a></em> genre in general circa the early 2000s after the release of <em>Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water</em>. In the late 90s they had a reasonable following in the rock/metal world, however were unknown in the pop music charts. <em>Chocolate Starfish</em> was then released at the end of 2000 with several singles charting high and even one single ("Rollin'") reaching Number One in UK and Ireland, leaving many original fans feeling betrayed that their music was now being listened to by the same people who listened to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. This was also the view within the nu metal genre as a whole, who hated how Bizkit had usurped the genre and turned it into literally everything it wasn't supposed to be, and the general view among their peers by 2000 was that they couldn't go away fast enough.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a>:
<ul><li> When "What I've Done" and "New Divide" were featured in the Michael Bay-directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> movies. This is an especially bad instance of this phenomenon because Linkin Park was plenty popular <em>before</em> that happened, with <em>Hybrid Theory</em> and <em>Meteora</em> having achieved widespread success, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">yet this trope was not in force for those albums.</a> For other fans including those two songs to an action movie wasn't what sold them out. It was the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> included "Leave Out All the Rest" to the soundtrack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">one of her movies</a>, which led to Twilight Fans entering the already divided fanbase and dividing it even further.
</li><li> Linkin Park's only output before <em>Hybrid Theory</em>, though, was a couple of demos of which only a few hundred copies were ever pressed. They never really had time to hit that sweet spot of indie-dom, since <em>Hybrid Theory</em> was selling millions of copies fairly quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> received a lot of hatred because they too made their sound more mainstream in the early nineties with <em>Countdown to Extinction</em>. They later began moving back towards their traditional style for a little bit before deciding to jump right back into the sound of their nineties output with <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Th1rt3en" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Th1rt3en">Th1rt3en</a></em>, which received a less-than-enthusiastic reaction, and continued on that path with <em>Super Collider</em>, which was met with near-universal dislike.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>, oh, good lord, Metallica. The most evident example is their 1991 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Self-Titled Album</a>, aka "The Black Album", which was the most mainstream of their albums at that point and also marked a change in their style from thrash to a more general metal sound. It provided them a lot of success, at the time making them the biggest metal band in the world but also gave them an incredible amount of hate and sellout accusations from their original fan base. <br><br>Though, really, they've been accused of this to a certain extent with every album following their debut usually on account on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>. Frontman James Hetfield finds it quite amusing. <em>Ride The Lightning</em> for having a ballad; <em>Master of Puppets</em> for being slightly less thrash sounding, <em>And Justice For All</em> for having more of a progressive sound, as well as (GASP!) <em>having a video</em> for their song, "One" and (THE HORROR) earning them <em>a Grammy nomination</em>, <em>Load</em> and <em>Reload</em> for also having different styles, and <em>Death Magnetic</em> for not being a exact copy of <em>Master of Puppets</em>. No matter what they do, Metallica is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">never going to catch a break</a> from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">so called "fans</a>". And, to make it worse, this was piled onto legit hate for them from their battle with Napster, which amplified the problem with the fan base, and those that didn't like their Napster battle joined in on the sellout hate. It made it very difficult to tell who was just hate dumbing and who was actually saying a legit problem they had with the band.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ModestMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ModestMouse">Modest Mouse</a> suffered from this after <em>Float On</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Muse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Muse">Muse</a> has suffered a lot of this since the release of <em>Black Holes And Revelations</em>, and to a lesser extent since <em>Absolution</em>. Muse were considered very cool when they were indie artists on their first two albums, <em>Showbiz</em> and <em>Origin Of Symmetry</em>, and reached their peak when they hit the mainstream with <em>Absolution</em>. By the time <em>Black Holes</em> came out, it was considered a disappointment because the singles released from it were pop songs rather than rock. This happens a lot, in fact, if an album is represented by the songs which are atypical for the album itself. Ever since "Supermassive Black Hole" was featured in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series film, you can't go to a Muse video on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> without fanboys shrieking about <em>Twilight</em> fans liking Muse due to said song in movie. Sad, because while <em>Twilight</em> is a polarizing series, almost everyone likes Muse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback">Nickelback</a>. For a band with such a vocal Hatedom, and that so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltyPleasures">few people claim to like publicly</a>, you'd think they'd get less airplay and make less money. A lot of their hatedom from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">grunge</a> fans stems solely from the fact that the band can fill stadiums and arenas. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bustedtees.com/blamecanadafornickelback">Blame<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">Canada</a> for Nickelback, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">eh</a>?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>:
<ul><li> It's widely believed that frontman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> killed himself as a result of his fear of this trope and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">came to hate</a> the band's signature song, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">supposed to be a parody</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">same fans it started attracting</a>) often refusing to play it live. Additionally, the band's popularity is often used to claim that they're overrated, and even some grunge fans don't like them solely because of it.
</li><li> Kurt Cobain often wrote pop songs to subvert this. Even <em>Bleach</em>, their most abrasive and inaccessible release has "About A Girl" on it, which he wrote after listening to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> all day. They followed up <em>Nevermind</em> with <em>In Utero</em>, which is much sludgier than <em>Nevermind</em> but ultimately reaches a compromise: songs which were heavy enough for <em>Bleach</em>/<em>Incesticide</em> fans, but melodic enough for <em>Nevermind</em> fans. "In Bloom", from <em>Nevermind</em> points fun at the people who listened to Nirvana because they were popular and didn't understand the lyrics, as well as the fact that plenty of the kind of people who bullied Kurt in high school were now listening to his music but were still losers.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a> with <em>Tragic Kingdom</em> which put them on the charts with their hit singles, "Don't Speak" and "Just a Girl". Even more so with <em>Rock Steady</em> which was seen by their &#145;90s fans as essentially the first Gwen Stefani solo album and was created solely to pander to pop audiences.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a> gained a huge following of teenage girls in the U.K. through their appearance on the 2010 season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">The X Factor</a></em>. Some of their original fans were <em>not</em> happy to see them become massive worldwide and were especially turned off by their success in the United States, and feared the boys would abandon their British fans to pander to American Directioners. Those fans eventually jumped to support new artists like <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConorMaynard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConorMaynard">Conor Maynard</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UnionJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UnionJ">Union J</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVamps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVamps">The Vamps</a>, hoping they avoid "Americanization."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> has never really gotten the full treatment of this, but his solo work being more popular and successful than his work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> is often the only basis snobbier fans use to claim the former isn't as good as the latter. He also got some minor claims of this with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOsbournes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOsbournes">The Osbournes</a></em> reality show in the early 2000's, which brought him a whole new generation of fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a> actually kind of inverted this to turn less commercial, everything after <em>Vs</em>. were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">New Sound Albums</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>:
<ul><li> Happened after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></em> in the minds of some of their fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">who preferred their old psychedelic music</a> over the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">harder and darker</a> material.
</li><li> Though in this case, the band themselves felt this way, particularly Roger Waters, who didn't like the larger, noisier audiences that their greater exposure attracted (leading to his infamous, sputum-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a> during the <em>Animals</em> tour).
</li><li> Also poor old Syd Barrett, who passed his own fame-tolerance threshold back when they were plugging their first album, leading to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">taking permanent refuge in drugs.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>, particularly in the years after Freddie Mercury's passing, where their most famous works skyrocketed in popularity with their use in films, commercials, sports events and random Internet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memes</a>. The trope, however, most likely began to take effect as early as 1974 when "Killer Queen" started climbing the charts. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WeWillRockYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WeWillRockYou">We Will Rock You</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BohemianRhapsody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BohemianRhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a></em> have only intensified the sentiment amongst older fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a> parodied this on his 1999 ode to over-the-hill rock stars, "I'm Dead (But I Don't Know It)."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' popularity became so high at the time of <em>Stadium Arcadium</em> and its singles overplayed that even they became exhausted by the fame, going on a 3 year hiatus after the tour finished. This caused their guitarist John Frusciante to leave the band for the second time, for exactly the same reason he left the first time (except that the previous time he was also a heroin addict).
<ul><li> It should be noted that there were fans who accused the band of selling out when they signed to Warner Bros and released the ballad Under The Bridge way back in 1991, even though most of its parent album Blood Sugar Sex Magik was a continuation (and possibly even improvement) of their old sound. Had Internet forums been around back then, there would have been a lot of this sort of debate on it. Even more so in the Californication and By The Way periods which were full of introspective ballads(One Hot Minute escaped this trope largely because it was not a massive radio success). By The Way in particular is incredibly divisive for the band, something they readily acknowledged with the rockier single Fortune Faded (itself a rerecorded By The Way outtake) and the more funk-based album Stadium Arcadium. The band has sunk in popularity with their latest album I'm With You and its singles series, indicating that they might be becoming a cult band again.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> fans felt this way about the band after they made the move to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a>, and specifically in the wake of their surprise "Losing My Religion" hit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RiseAgainst">Rise Against</a>. Many fans feel their first few albums were closer to hardcore punk, faster, and generally less melodic than their previous two. It doesn't help, then, that these were their two real 'mainstream' albums (though they had some success prior to them). While the subjects of the songs are much the same, older fans often feel that the albums are intentionally more accessible to non-punk fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a>. A lot of people found <em>John Henry</em>, their first album with a full band, to be selling out. God only knows what these people think of the band's four (so far) children's albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>. Because of this trope, their fanbase is divided into two groups; pre-"Joshua Tree" and post "Joshua Tree".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVerve">The Verve</a>. A lot of fans of their earlier psychedelic work (pre-"the") absolutely despise the hugely popular <em>Urban Hymns</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>. The band was always popular, but when they became international sensations with the release of <em>Tommy</em>, fans of their earlier work thought they were becoming <em>too</em> popular.

</li><li> According to many a disillusioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OFWGKTA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OFWGKTA">OFWGKTA</a> fan, the group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever">completely fell off</a> following the success of frontman Tyler, The Creator's viral single "Yonkers" and subsequent album <em>Goblin</em> (a view that Tyler himself shares to some degree, as he hates "Yonkers" and most of his old output, and sought to distance himself from it with <em>Flower Boy</em>). Earl Sweatshirt openly sought to invoke this circa <em>Doris</em>, stating that he knew he'd gain some new fans and lose some old ones, and was happy that he would because he <em>wanted</em> to lose the old fans who were just there for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">horrorcore output</a> and didn't want him to grow as an artist.

</li><li> A case of It Was Popular, So It Sucks: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgPhilippTelemann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgPhilippTelemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a> was the most (commercially) successful and highly regarded German composer of his time and in the course of an extremely long and productive life (1681-1767) wrote more music than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeFredericHandel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeFredericHandel">Georg Friedrich H&auml;ndel</a> combined. After Bach was rediscovered in the mid-19th century, it became fashionable among musicologists and music-lovers to regard him as <em>the</em> great genius of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaroqueMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaroqueMusic">Baroque Music</a>. Since Bach had not been very successful commercially, it was easy to paint him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible">a misunderstood and unappreciated master</a> who wrote for eternity while the "shallow" Telemann marketed himself by pandering to the tastes of the uncouth audience and producing notes as if in a factory. It would take over a century, during which other German Baroque composers besides Bach and H&auml;ndel were rediscovered and reappreciated, for Telemann to (largely) regain his original stature. The ironic thing was that Bach and Telemann admired each other<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jzn5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3jzn5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jzn5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (Telemann at Bach's request became godfather to his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, and wrote a sonnet in Bach's honour when he died) </span> and Bach not only copied out by hand entire cantatas written by Telemann, but would also sometimes incorporate Telemann scores into his own works, as was perfectly normal in the 18th century (before copyright laws). And then admirers of Bach like Philipp Spitta and Albert Schweitzer (yes, <em>that</em> Albert Schweitzer) inadvertently used pieces attributed to Bach but actually written by Teleman (as it turned out after musicologists properly took stock of the surviving part of Telemann's huge oeuvre) to "prove" the nigh-infinite superiority of Bach over Telemann.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntonioVivaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntonioVivaldi">Vivaldi</a> was popular during his lifetime, but died in obscurity and was forgotten by most of the world until the 20th century. Today, his <em>Four Seasons</em> has a fair <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadToTheBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadToTheBone">due to them being overplayed in popular media</a>, especially <em>Spring</em>.

</li><li> Averted with <em>Lata Mangeshkar</em>. Despite being one of the most popular singers that Bollywood ever has known plenty of Indians consider her to be one of the greatest people that ever lived due to her incredible singing voice. One has to wonder how heavily Bollywood averts this though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Watain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Watain">Watain</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> community is notorious for its elitism towards bands that achieve even the slightest amount of mainstream recognition. So it goes without saying that when the band received a Swedish Grammi for <em>Lawless Darkness,</em> the fandom went berserk. Interestingly, there are some who accuse them of always having sucked, and being little more than knockoffs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dissection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dissection">Dissection</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4xbpa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4xbpa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4xbpa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Never mind that Mayhem have received a quite a bit of critical acclaim amongst the fandom as well, in no small part due to the controversy they brought on themselves in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a> genre <em>as a whole</em> fits this trope. Not only is hip-hop undeniably one of, if not the most, popular music genres in the world, but it's listened to by so many people that it can be <em>very</em> hard to tell how many of them genuinely enjoy the genre, or how many of them either listen to it because it's trendy or haven't explored enough music to find something they personally like more. It's gotten to the point that fans of other genres instantly write off rap due to how commercialized it is, and label its fans as ignorant people manipulated by the masses, even though that is certainly <strong>not</strong> always the case. Doesn't help that core hip-hop/Rap fans kinda share the same cynical opinion about modern Rap/Hip-Hop.

<ul><li> This happens ALL THE TIME in wrestling.
<ul><li> Especially in the IWC (Internet Wrestling Community). There were a lot more haters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> when they turned face than when they originally found their footing as "bad guys". (Look at some of the reactions Rock got on rec.sport.pro-wrestling between 1999-2000, for instance!) Granted, the fan favorite versions of both, and others, tended to pick up a bit of "Austin Powers Syndrome" in that their "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">characters</a>" became catchphrase machines.
</li><li> The IWC once LOVED <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> at one point!
</li><li> ...and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, probably before all the political stories came to light. That is, if the dirtsheets are to be believed...
</li><li> And something happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>, as he came there minus the IWC fans who called him one of the best workers in the world, instead ridiculing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">his delusional radio interviews and etc.</a> and his past refusals to address supposed drug problems.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark">Smart Mark</a> darling on the independent scene, with the fans hailing him as quite possibly the best wrestler in America (or at the very least, the best wrestler in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>, which is kind of synonymous these days). Then he signed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, and became the centerpiece of its ECW revival, and now all of a sudden you can't go into a wrestling forum without hearing about how Punk is overrated and a sloppy wrestler. Some of this might be spillover anger from the ECW revival being mishandled; but Punk was one of the few bright spots of the show, and yet he seems to get the most criticism. Now that he's moved away from ECW onto Raw and then Smackdown and become world champ, the criticisms have only gotten worse. Partially due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> &mdash; a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark">Smart Marks</a> kept hearing how great Punk was from ROHbots when he was working long main event matches, against top level opponents, with free reign over his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick">gimmick</a> and promos. Five minute extended squashes over Justin Credible didn't quite match up... Now that CM Punk has turned into a crazy cult-leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">Heel</a>, he's won over a <em>lot</em> of his former detractors. And from there, we had the 2011 'Pipe Bombs' and suddenly Punk is back to being among the smarks, as he so proudly declares, the <em><strong>BEST IN THE WORLD.</strong></em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvanBourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvanBourne">Evan Bourne</a>, formerly known as Matt Sydal. Hell, just calling him by his WWE name is enough to set off indy wrestling purists in some communities.
</li><li> Pick <strong>any</strong> wrestler who's being used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">Jobber</a> or just not being featured enough. You will find many IWC fans putting them over on message boards and saying they deserve pushes etc and how much they should be treated better than how they're being used right now. The wrestler gets a push - they're not underrated anymore so cue large amounts of haters and complainers bashing them.
</li><li> At the start of 2010 Evan Bourne was a jobber getting squashed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> most weeks. Many fans were complaining about how unfair this was to him. In the middle of the year he got a bit of a push by main eventing Raw and working great matches with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>. Suddenly cue large amounts of threads bashing him for not looking old enough or some even complaining about how weak his kicks were. Oh boy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart">Natalya</a> got this too. Ever since she was depushed in mid 2008 plenty of IWC fans were complaining about how she barely wrestled anymore and how they were dying for her to get a push. The Hart Dynasty split in late 2010 and Nattie got pushed in a Divas' title feud. She won the belt eventually and suddenly fans were complaining about how boring she was. When she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in early 2015, she suddenly gained back support, with fans once again complaining about her not being used properly.
</li><li> This happened with John Cena. Hell back in 2003 when he faced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> for the belt at Backlash, the majority of fans <strong>wanted</strong> him to win the title. Nowadays any IWC fan wanting Cena to win a title is almost unheard of. The main reason he's hated is because he's got a large kid fanbase.
</li><li> A bit of a borderline example. When former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Tyler Black</a> decided to sign a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> developmental contract in late 2010, the ROH fans immediately turned on him and called him a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sellout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sellout">sellout</a>". Black admitted in a later interview that this bothered him, and he used those feelings as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">heel gimmick he took up due to the news</a>. (In perhaps a bit of irony, Black supposedly also had the chance to re-negotiate his ROH contract, or also sign with TNA. Who convinced him to sign with WWE? The aforementioned Evan Bourne).
</li><li> Black isn't the first ROH wrestler to turn an impending move to WWE into a heel run; the aforementioned CM Punk did the same thing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> was very popular during his days as the muscle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>. After the group disbanded and Reigns got a singles push, almost everyone turned against him. The reason being that he was clearly being positioned as the next top babyface despite not being anywhere near ready for that position.
</li><li> Like fellow indie-wrestlers-turned-WWE-superstars CM Punk and Daniel Bryan before him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> saw a very similar reaction. When he debuted in The Shield and went on to have his solo career, Ambrose could do no wrong in the eyes of the fans, especially the IWC. After Daniel Bryan, Ambrose pretty much had the second biggest amount of grassroots support from fans imaginable and &mdash; especially when Bryan's career was on hiatus &mdash; seemingly almost everybody wanted him to become WWE champion. After he finally won the WWE Championship from Seth Rollins, however, a lot of fans turned on him for a variety of reasons, whether it was accusing him of becoming complacent on the top or accusing him of being a really limited wrestler in the ring. Ambrose himself, on the other hand, didn't seem to mind people turning on him too much because as he told Ziggler in a promo, anybody who becomes world champion had better have ice water running through their veins in order to put up with all the doubters and nay-sayers. Fortunately for Ambrose, the backlash died down significantly, and he was nowhere near as despised as his ex-Shield stablemate Roman Reigns.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> was extremely popular when she was on WWE NXT, and was given a thunderous ovation when she made her move to the WWE main roster in 2014. Nowadays, she's seen as another example of a dumbed-down and underwhelming Diva, saddled with mediocre matches and badly written angles, and she's today considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a> at best and a full-on Scrappy at worst. And that's not even getting into her personal life. Ultimately subverted following her return in late 2017.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte Flair</a> was once one of the "Four Horsewomen", four female wrestlers from WWE's NXT brand credited for helping revitalize women's wrestling. However, as her career made the shift to WWE's main roster, fan opinion of her began to sour, with her being seen as another wrestler who was largely a disappointment to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">her father&#146;s legacy</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss">Alexa Bliss</a> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> during her run in NXT and her run on SmackDown Live. Once she was drafted to RAW in 2017, becoming both its top female heel and RAW Women's Champion, she became booked as both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a>. Her unique gimmick was largely stripped down and replaced with a generic heel persona, and her first major feud on RAW against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> was a disaster that hurt both wrestlers&#146; credibility quite badly, especially due to a universally panned "This Is Your Life" segment. Many people started turning on her, seeing her as an average worker who was only being pushed because of her looks. The heat reached nuclear levels when she won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> ladder match in 2018 over several newer stars. The backlash died down once she was booted out of the title picture to put the focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a>, but even now, she is still seen as largely a joke.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>'s popularity started dying down once he won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, due to both the obvious notion that WCW didn't know what to do with him after putting the belt on him and fans getting sick of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> schtick. Anti-Goldberg signs and chants became increasingly common, which was countered by WCW allegedly piping in chants and cheers for him. The whole point of the Starrcade screwjob and the fingerpoke of doom was to make Goldberg vulnerable and have him work his way back to the title by ramming through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">New World Order</a> one member at a time. But it never materialized and Goldberg never quite recovered his momentum after that.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Microsoft Windows</a> became an Internet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiChrist">Antichrist</a> when it clearly dominated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComputerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComputerWars">Computer Wars</a>. Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacOS">macOS</a> did the reverse and became an Internet darling when it became the apparent underdog. Recently though, Mac has rebounded in popularity with the help of the iPod and may have picked up this trope as well but Apple hate is nothing compared to Microsoft hate. Don't dare to criticize any of its competitors or even point out their flaws: on a forum can bring the suspects that you're paid by Micro$oft to bash other OSes, while others are so good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">they would never do it</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of Apple, Apple Inc itself has become this. While still an underdog in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComputerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComputerWars">Computer Wars</a>, the company has recently diversified beyond home computing, its dominance of the portable music player market and the downloadable music market (with the iPod and iTunes respectively), along with the success of iPhone, has made the company highly profitable even though it doesn't retain the share of the PC market it enjoyed in its computer-heyday. It has even overtaken long-time competitor Microsoft's share value <em>and</em> net worth. However, Apple's increased presence in these new markets and among ordinary people becoming Apple users (not to mention the late Steve Jobs' sporadic rants about competing products or Apple's heavy-handed tendency to enforce litigation against anyone who leaked details of unreleased or rumored products) have invoked this trope, where long-time fanboys are upset that the company is no longer part of the counter-culture they aspire to. The shift from its previous "Think different" campaign to the present somewhat-elitist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanProduct">Strawman Product</a> advertising as well, not to mention that Apple seems to get away with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">anything bad they do</a> unlike Microsoft, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">often snobbish user base</a> also contributes towards this. <br><br>Some say that this may mark the end of "<em>Microsoft's empire</em>" and are calling Apple "<em>the new Microsoft</em>", but there's little sign that Microsoft is becoming "<em>Unpopular, now it Rocks</em>" considering that Microsoft is still dominating in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComputerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComputerWars">Computer Wars</a>.
</li><li> Ubuntu has made Linux more user-friendly and easier for newbies. Many GNU/Linux <em>users</em> complain about how mainstream this operating system has become, hence moving to other obscure operating systems such as Plan 9, BSD, and Haiku. A few long-time users are annoyed that the newbies seem more interested in getting actual work done than hacking the kernel. <br><br>Linux itself is becoming this trope for some so-called <em>experts</em> which only tell people to <em>Google it, n00b</em>. (One wonders if those are paid by Google or just want a job there)
<ul><li> In this case, there is a partial justification: making a system easy for beginners to use means adding extra components that will slow it down or otherwise make it inappropriate for experts to do very specific things. Continuing to harp on about Ubuntu's mainstream release when there are "expert" distros like Arch (or even Ubuntu Minimal) available is a solid example of this trope in action.
</li><li> To a certain extent, where software is concerned, this trope actually has some basis in reality. The tradeoff between user friendliness (interface complexity) and actual sound design from an internal/engineering standpoint (implementation complexity) is legendary. This is as much true in Ubuntu's case as it has ever been; Ubuntu has gained the former, while neglecting the latter.

<ul><li> For quite a number of years, being a Boston Red Sox fan was something passed down from parent to child. The "Red Sox Nation" went through roughly four generations without a Series win, and most Bosox fans were roundly mocked for supporting a "winless team". When Boston finally took home the Series in 2004, there was an influx of new fans - who were immediately labeled "bandwagon jumpers" because they hadn't endured generations of disappointment. To this day, unless you can legitimately claim to have been supporting them since well before their Series win, you <em>will</em> be derided as "not a true fan."
</li><li> The Chicago White Sox went even longer without a World Series championship, and their fanbase underwent a similar development after the team won the Series in 2005.
</li><li> The same thing happened to the Chicago Cubs in 2016. Given that they had last won a World Series in 1908, and had essentially sculpted their entire brand since then around being the "lovable losers", this had surprisingly mixed reactions among Cubs fans.
</li><li> Similar to the Red Sox example, the 2009-2010 Chicago Blackhawks experienced this trope. Having <em>finally</em> been allowed to show Hawks games on the air<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5rnng');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5rnng" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5rnng');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the owner at the time felt it was wrong to air them on TV because it alienated fans who bought tickets.</span>, combined with the Hawks' potential to reach the Stanley Cup, the otherwise <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Runt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Runt">least-popular Chicago team</a> became The Big Thing for a while. This <em>really</em> ticked off the die-hard fans who had stuck with the team through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>. It didn't help that the 'new fans' were significantly different from the die-hard fans demographically: they were younger, more ethnically diverse, and enjoyed a wide variety of sports. Many of these new fans even enjoyed the successful minor league Wolves up in Rosemont before jumping on the bandwagon, who took advantage of the doldrums of the Blackhawks to build their fanbase up out of fans who wouldn't support the Hawks.
</li><li> The Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL got this treatment. In a league of 8 to 9 teams (depending on the years discussed), the Roughriders have won three championships in 100 years (which is about 1/5th of how many they should have won, for those wanting to keep track). After each win, new fans were instantly shouted at for being not a true fan. It gets worse when, at any other time, the rest of the league will laugh at you for cheering for the lovable loser.
</li><li> When Finland's national hockey team plays in the World Championships tournament or in the Winter Olympics, many Finns, who don't otherwise know or care much about the sport, suddenly get glued to their TV's. This - in some hardcore fans' opinion - causes the broadcasting company to "dumb down" the level of commentary.
</li><li> The game of baseball &mdash; not so much any rise in popularity in itself, but the reason why it does. When home run and scoring numbers skyrocket, more people flock to the ballpark &mdash; much to the chagrin of purists, who insist that "pitcher's duels" are the best type of games.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twenty20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twenty20">Twenty 20</a> cricket is far more popular than traditional Test cricket or even One Day Internationals, and thus many purists refer to it as "hit-and-giggle".
</li><li> Extreme sports in particular are targets of this. Skateboarding fans, for example, tend to complain to no end about the new fans that come with video games series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TonyHawksProSkater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a></em>.
</li><li> Apparently if you are a Pittsburgh Penguins fan, you can't be a true pure fan because you only liked them when Crosby and Malkin came into the team. The same thing happened when Lemieux came over.
</li><li> Cities that have more than one team in a sport (mostly New York) have to deal with fans switching team allegiance depending on which team is more successful at the time. Example, when the Giants won the Super Bowl in 2008, they were New York's most popular team until the Jets made it to back to back AFC Championships in 2010-11, only to become the popular team again when they won it all in 2012. Fans that stay loyal to only one of the teams, regardless of their performance, find this very annoying.
</li><li> Many hardcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UltimateFightingChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UltimateFightingChampionship">UFC</a> fans are quickly turning on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a> after her fight with Bethe Correa and the mainstream media circus that followed, with most of those fans shifting their support to hardcore icon Conor McGregor. It got even worse after her loss to Holly Holm, with fans rejecting her and calling her an overrated fad that was bound to end. However, it barely made a dent in her mainstream popularity &mdash; being "the toughest woman on the planet" still makes her a strong symbol of feminism and keeps her popular with general audiences; in other terms, Ronda Rousey has essentially become the John Cena of MMA.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Rent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Rent">RENT</a></em> received this treatment with the movie version, as fans of the 3-hour stage musical (many of whom can sing it start to finish from memory) were annoyed that people were now allowed to experience the story in half the time. Never mind that it put the AIDS crisis back in the limelight for a while, after it had been relegated to "that disease that kills African people".
</li><li> As a company, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>'s suffered this perception since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, when the success of their tours and Las Vegas "resident" shows spurred a boom period for the company with many new productions being mounted (in 2003 they had three different shows in Vegas alone; in 2013 that number grew to <em>eight</em>). While the newer tent tours from <em>Corteo</em> onward have received the same generally warm reception from North American audiences and critics that older ones have, the fanbase has been far more critical of them. It doesn't help that some of their other productions of late went over badly with casual viewers and fans alike (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BananaShpeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BananaShpeel">Banana Shpeel</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CrissAngelBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CrissAngelBelieve">Criss Angel BeLIEve</a></em>, etc.) or were affected by outside circumstances (<em>ZED</em>, a Tokyo resident show, had to close after the post-2012 earthquake tourism slowdown) over 2008-2013, which gave support to the fans' claims that the company was favoring quantity over quality. On the upside, while the newer shows get a lot of brickbats from fans, the older shows that are still running (<em>Mystere</em> through <em>Varekai</em>, roughly) are regarded fondly, thanks in part to the company's excellent quality control.

Because of this, many fans say the game was a lot more enjoyable before it got popular due to factors in public lobbies like hackers, whistleblowers who tell their friends/siblings who the impostor is outside the game, people calling emergency meetings for frivilous reasons (such as trying to be funny or to plug their social media) and gullible players who believe one-sided claims with little to no evidence.

<ul><li> Many RPG fans just plain hate <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> because their preferred series isn't selling as much.

Interestingly enough; this complaint is <em>only</em> lobbed at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games; and occasionally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>; when any look through a gaming magazine can point out how many other games with big publishers or developers receive <em>just</em> as much advertising if not <em>more</em> than every game that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a> and Bungie make.

Possibly justified in that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> was a very polarizing game even back in its prime, with many praising it and many others considering it the worst in the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> was a commercial failure during 1.0 and it almost ended the game before it went past beta due to numerous problems that the dev team ignored. After a new development team was brought in to replace the former team, the game was redone from the ground up and relaunched with the subtitle <em>A Realm Reborn</em> (2.0). The game had a massive turnaround and became an extremely popular hit among fans, but many players who enjoyed 1.0 denounce the reworked game as selling out to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a> due to the game taking elements that made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> so popular.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> series has gotten popular enough to be alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> as one of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerApp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerApp">faces</a>" of the Xbox platform. Nevertheless, fans of previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EpicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EpicGames">Epic Games</a> titles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars">Console Wars</a> debaters don't really seem too pleased.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> provides an example within a game: there are people in the community that intentionally play unpopular characters, and find to their dismay that their team members leave the queue or flame them all game long because they picked a "bad" champion. But when the character is eventually "discovered" by the mainstream and rises on the tier list, they proceed to complain bitterly about tier lists and flavours of the month, abandon the champion and find a new unpopular character to play. It is apparently considered a badge of honour to claim you liked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGargoylesRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGargoylesRock">Galio</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Irelia</a> before they were popular. This is also expected to happen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Yorick</a>.
</li><li> Many RPG fans don't seem too pleased that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series has become a hit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG">especially since they went towards a different game style</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">than the "traditional" RPG</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, now that Mojang has received interviews in gaming magazines and been plugged on various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> blogs, people are calling the demise of the game. The cries of "Mojang is a sellout!" became even more common among fans once they announced <em>Minecraft</em> would come to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>, which happened because of the game's huge success. Thus, the game was later affiliated with Nintendo. It was received as well as you would imagine.

If any <em>Zelda</em> character (especially Link), or any <em>Zelda</em> game, or any <em>Zelda</em> <em>thing</em> is in a popularity contest of some kind, it's bound to sweep the competition, making most such contests extremely predictable and repetitive, especially to fans who prefer other game franchises. <em>Zelda</em> has a similar dominating presence on Dorkly, a <a class="urllink" href="https://ggnewbie.com">geek humor website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

The style change, while making the series more popular, has caused many fans of the series' original style to feel betrayed, cheated, and forgotten. Some of which are the same fans that, before the release of <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, were complaining that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks">the series had grown repetitive and stagnant</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> was well-received, bringing in newcomers to the series and thus making the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> franchise eclipse the popularity of the main series. Which leads to people complaining that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus">Atlus</a> has "sold out", leaning more towards making their games tailored to the mainstream. Complaints like this are tinged with a hint of irony, as the whole reason the <em>Persona</em> spinoff series was created in the first place was to make a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">MegaTen</a></em> game that was tailored to the mainstream. These complaints are intensifying with the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Golden</a></em> (to the point that Atlus has released multiple genre-bending sequels featuring both the <em>Persona 3</em> and <em>Persona 4</em> cast) is similarly getting trashed for proof that Atlus is "selling out". Even more so when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> joined the two during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">20th anniversary</a>, with tons of promotion for the three of them as well as crossover spinoffs in the vein of <em>Persona 4</em> (Including their own <em>Dancing All Night</em> games). At first, Fans of the (relatively obscure) <em>Persona 1</em> and <em>2</em> duology hated the "3-4-5" trio for straying too far from the more traditional <em>Megaten</em> gameplay of the former and <em>If</em> (and likewise for <em>3-4-5</em> to <em>1-2</em>), but it's somewhat justified franchise-wise since their games were downplayed in most of the anniversary events and seemed to have a crossover embargo due to the lead writers for them leaving Atlus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Nocturne</a></em> also suffers from this, since it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst">first main</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst">game to be released outside of Japan</a> and hence more people have played this one than the original two.

Word of mouth (plus high exposure due to being a <em>huge</em> RPG on the RPG-starved Gamecube) led to it being a big seller and award-winner, and for the first time a lot of gamers outside of Japan started looking into the series. Fast-forward six or seven years and now the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> has a <em>lot</em> of embittered older fans who are mad that the newer games in the series are bigger sellers and more popular than the pre-Symphonia cult classics that were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOFDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOFDestiny">early</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia">games</a>. And it's all blamed on <em>Symphonia</em>'s breakout popularity.
</li><li> The fanbase has been splintered again since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> began ditching a lot of the deep characterization and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">morally grey themes</a> that made the original games so loved in favour of a mainstream <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> themes, which have increased with each passing game. The base is now split between those who prefer this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> approach and those who miss the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine Worlds</a> of the old games. Ironically, <em>Vesperia</em> set itself up to be the darkest in the series with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">vigilantism</a> theme but underwent an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGenreChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGenreChange">Unexpected Genre Change</a> halfway through the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> has been getting this treatment since the PC games came out. Many question how such a simple shooter series became so unbelievably-popular, or take issue with how many fans of the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanworkOnlyFans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanworkOnlyFans">have never played one of the official games.</a> When a news program highlighted a fan-made <em>Touhou</em> video, never mind that <em>Touhou</em> wasn't even <em>mentioned</em> (and in fact, the newspeople probably didn't even know that <em>Touhou</em> existed), find a clip of that on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and see how many people are complaining that <em>Touhou</em> is mainstream now, and thus "ruined".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> took off in popularity almost as soon as it launched, making it one of the most popular games of 2015 and also winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> Best Game Ever bracket. A lot of people who don't care for the game or hate it outright are angry that any video featuring the game can rise beyond one million views and they also accuse some people covering/playing the game just to get more hits. Not only is the game popular overall, but it's also <em>very</em> popular within the furry fandom. Because of this, people often view the fanbase as atrocious and full of furries.
</li><li> Among the many haters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> are people who say that say because it is so popular, that it sucks. (That is, the people who have actually seen more than the box art.) Another large group of haters are people who complain that Blizzard has ruined the game by catering to the casual players, and believe the game was better back when raiding was still "hardcore". This is where it overcrosses with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>; since some of these same people were complaining about spending months getting their characters attuned. Typically, it's a <em>very</em> bad financial decision to have a game that locks out a good 75+% of its gamers from content and <em>only</em> cater to that &le;25% of the playerbase, since players typically <em>quit</em> when there's nothing for them. (If you're one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">elitists</a>, then that's what you want.) A large proportion of the time some people spend on message boards is taken up by claiming Blizzard's subscription figures are bogus and thus the game is not as popular as it is claimed to be, because xyzabcblahblahblah (insert personal bugbear or whatever here). Well-reasoned <em>legal</em> arguments with copious citations have not stopped this train of thought.
<ul><li> The cross-genre reaction to Pandarens. During early years of the game, Pandarens were one of the races most desired as playable by the fans. Two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Kung Fu Panda</a></em> movies later and the announcement of Pandarens has been met with immense ridicule.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series has its own twist on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">First Installment Wins</a> trope that comes into play here, as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda</a> has a propensity for building each new game in the series from the ground up, so most players end up comparing every new game to whichever game in the series they played first, their own personal version of "first installment wins". And given that each new game in the series tends to exponentially increase in popularity (for better or worse) over previous games, it naturally matches up with this trope as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> tends to ensue, with fans of the previous installments declaring the newest installment to be inferior.
</li><li> The first two games in the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena">Arena</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em>, were solid games (despite <em>Daggerfall</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a> issues), but were mere drops in the massive bucket that was the late-90s PC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternRPG">Western RPG</a> scene. Still, they developed a fairly strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Fanbase</a> which kept the series alive and, after a six-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">Sequel Gap</a>, led to the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>. <em>Morrowind</em> was a massive critical <em>and</em> commercial hit, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a> for both the series and for Bethesda in general. Owing to both the sequel gap and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiPlatform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiPlatform">Multi-Platform</a> release (PC and X-Box), <em>Morrowind</em> introduced a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">Newbie Boom</a>, contributing to its success. All of this added up to <em>Morrowind</em>'s "Game of the Year" edition still being available in stores even <em>eight years after its release</em>. However, until about 2006, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">small but vocal group</a> of older, "hardcore" <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans derided <em>Morrowind</em> as derivative and dumbed down compared to <em>Daggerfall</em>, which was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">True Art</a>" and was granted "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Immunity to Criticism</a>", and considered <em>Morrowind</em> to be the symbol of everything that was wrong with the gaming industry. What happened in 2006? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> was released. Despite its own "Game of the Year" level successes and popularity, <em>Oblivion</em> was now the symbol of everything wrong with the gaming industry, while <em>Morrowind</em> became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredCow">Sacred Cow</a>. In 2011, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> came out? Ditto. Rinse and repeat.
</li><li> Another angle to the situation for the series is that there seems to be a loose "odd-even" configuration to the fandom. It's not uncommon to find fans of both <em>Daggerfall</em> (The 2nd <em>ES</em> game) and <em>Oblivion</em> (the 4th), who enjoy that those games are closer to classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> while disliking <em>Morrowind</em> (the 3rd) and <em>Skyrim</em> (the 5th) for being too "alien". Meanwhile, fans of these odd-numbered titles favor them over the even-numbered titles for the <em>exact same reason</em>.
</li><li> Yet <em>another</em> angle to the debate is the perception that the series has been getting "dumbed down" as it has grown more popular. Ask a fan, and they'll tell you that <em>their</em> favorite game was the one that struck the right balance of openness and accessibility. For example, <em>Daggerfall</em> has a <em>gigantic</em> world map, roughly 161,600 km in size (similar to the size of Great Britain), while every subsequent game has gone with a much, much smaller world map. However, these games use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCompression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCompression">Space Compression</a> and drop most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyGeneratedLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyGeneratedLevels">random</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">procedural</a> generation that <em>Daggerfall</em> used to fill out its huge world, instead greatly increasing content density and variety within the smaller worlds. Other changes of the course of the series include: armors and outfits becoming less and less modular and customizable, spells and enchantments dwindling in numbers and variety, abandonment of mechanics like birthsigns (which granted passive bonuses and railroaded the status growths into a class archetype).
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Some people believe the insane popularity of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series is what made the <em>Brawl</em> entry cater more to casual players due to the many changes made to the game mechanics and balance.
<ul><li> Let us all remember of the divisive fact: what many considered intricate controlling - wavedashing, the most famous case - was a technique that even the makers thought it would bring a nice differential to the game, back in the <em>Melee</em> days. But the mastering of said techniques were spreading a huge gap between the hardcore players and those playing for fun in the metagame. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">It was the very rivalry between these groups getting out of hand in the communities that got those techniques removed from Brawl onwards</a>.
</li><li> There's also the series itself as a whole, which quickly eclipsed every traditional fighting game in popularity, sales, and mainstream awareness and has never stopped doing that. It's not hard to find fans of traditional fighting games who are quite resentful of that, and you'll likely find at least a few who refuse to play a <em>Smash Bros.</em> game due to the effects it has had on the rest of the genre, such as the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">Newbie Boom</a> each time a new <em>Smash Bros.</em> game comes out and the mechanics being very different than traditional fighting games. The issue is even more pronounced with fighting game fans in Japan, for many of whom <em>Smash Bros.</em> is classified as an "Unmentionable," meaning the mere acknowledgement of the existence of <em>Smash Bros.</em>, even indirectly, is frowned upon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> got a taste of this when Nintendo of America announced an American release for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>. Longtime fans raised such a stink about not only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">localization changes</a> but claimed the onslaught of newbie fans would muck up the nice cozy little fandom club they'd built for themselves.
<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> came out and received acclaim and commercial success, the reaction from 'hardcore fans' was predictable. They got even angrier when both Robin and Lucina were made playable characters for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>
<ul><li> Speaking of <em>Smash Bros.</em>, non-fans of the series began to see this to an extent when Sakurai made Corrin playable rather than a character from basically any other franchise, with special shout-outs going to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>. However, the Inklings were finally added in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>.
</li><li> It continues with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, which not only takes pages from Awakening's book but has the new Phoenix Mode and removes weapon durability. Thankfully, some fans are appeased by one of the two paths having gameplay on par with the older games.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> When Famitsu released <a class="urllink" href="http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Famitsu_Japan%27s_100_favorite_video_games">their<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> top 100 games (as voted by the Japanese) to the Western public tons of fans of JRPG's started to get so angry that they swore to never play a JRPG again. It was also the source of some of the backlash towards <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> in the west.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em> series has started being hit with this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune">Drake's Fortune</a></em> was a moderate hit, but both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted2AmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted2AmongThieves">Among Thieves</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted3DrakesDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted3DrakesDeception">Drake's Deception</a></em> were mega-sellers, garnered tons of media attention, and wound up becoming so successful that Nathan Drake has practically become a mascot for the Playstation, which has naturally started bringing some detractors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> got this when the success of the franchise took off in such a way that the creator behind it, a lone indie developer previously known for making failed games, decided to make three sequels within the span of one year. The hate eventually reached a point where said developer <a class="urllink" href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/997/995/eb8.png">eventually addressed this mentality<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> and how shallow it is compared to people who have legitimate complaints about his games.
</li><li> Even in games that have not experienced this trope yet, individual weapons, characters, equipment, etc. within the game can be the victims of this. If something gets too popular, a good portion of the community will start to label whatever it is as overused. This often happens for competitive multiplayer games.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> has become quite notorious for this. Virtually <em>anything</em> can get this treatment from the GTA community once it gets too popular, be it a car, gun, mask, shirt, you name it, especially in the multiplayer portion of the game. This especially manifests itself on GTA-related forums, resulting in posts/threads that trash fast supercars as overrated and the like. Hell, even <em>GTA V</em> itself gets flacked on from fans of earlier GTA games. (in particular fans of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">the fourth game</a>)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>' already has this attitude as soon as the game was announced as being free-to-play. Suddenly, everyone who had Steam could start playing and it also made people who had to buy this game feel cheated. Calling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">free-to-play</a> is still sometimes viewed as an insult and a synonym for being a noob, although the free-to-play players either quit the game or got competent. (The fanbase was already divided over the addition of hats.)
<ul><li> Wearing the Ghastly Gibus, the Mercenary or the Pyrovision googles is often seen as proof of a lack of skill, as these cosmetics are the only one easily available for free to play players. Free to Play Players cannot receive hats from a random drop, and they can't trade with other players, thus removing the two bigger sources of hats in the game, while the Mercenary is automatically handed to a new player the first time they log in, and the Gibus and Googles are obtained as soon as you land a domination on a player wearing said items. Since premium players never wear the Gibus once they end up getting a new, fancier hat, some players use it on purpose, in order to lower the expectation of their opponents, before pulling off some advanced technique to a rival who didn't planned to receive a complicated tricks.
</li></ul></li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> has started to get hit with this. Overwatch quickly shot up in popularity because of its fun gameplay, where casual gamers and pros alike can enjoy, its charming cast of well designed characters, and its surprising good lore which Blizzard has fully backed with high quality animated shorts films. The game got so popular, that many people who don't normally play video games or first person shooters became fans. The game became huge in the Esports community to the point that a nationwide Esports league was announced among many tournaments. The game became big overseas, especially in Asia, whom ironically have a reputation of <em>not</em> liking first person shooters. It won many Game Of The Year awards in 2016, the year the game was released. However, starting in early 2017, the game began getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> for several reasons.
<ul><li> Given how <em>Overwatch</em> became the most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroShooter">Hero Shooter</a>, many games in the genre had to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCopiedItSoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyCopiedItSoItSucks">the stigma of being shallow clones of Blizzard's title</a>. Many hero shooters released after <em>Overwatch</em> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battleborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battleborn">Battleborn</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LawBreakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LawBreakers">LawBreakers</a></em> flopped partially because of unfavorable comparisons to <em>Overwatch</em>. Even successful games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApexLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApexLegends">Apex Legends</a></em>, a battle royale game with an edgier sci-fi art direction and gameplay inspired by <em>PUBG</em>, gets pitted against <em>Overwatch</em> just because it too has a colorful cast of characters. For many, the <em>Overwatch</em>'s popularity and status as the genre standard has created an environment where it becomes impossible for hero shooters to stand out and be judged only on their own merits.
</li><li> Then there's its hated loot box system in which players are incentivized to pay actual money to open boxes in hopes of getting cosmetics through a randomized system. While the system garnered complaints in the beginning, it didn&#146;t take until much later for the system to become more common in the gaming industry. Many people blame the game for popularizing and normalizing a gameplay mechanic that some have likened to gambling.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/GrisaiaNoKajitsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/GrisaiaNoKajitsu">Grisaia no Kajitsu</a></em> received this treatment when it was localized overseas for the first time in 2015 and became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a> among the western visual novel community. Its unexpected popularity put it on the same level as other high-profile Japanese visual novels like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em>, and in doing so, attracted a lot of detractors who would argue against the visual novel's overall quality. Some points of contention go towards the story pacing, the quality of the heroines (Michiru often being a popular punching bag), and the entire premise of the visual novel itself. A sizable amount of people flooded forums like Fuwanovel and r/vns just to complain about <em>Grisaia</em>, and in the latter's case, the complaints got so bad that much stricter rules and filters were set in place to prevent similar circumstances from happening again. Nowadays, this trend has largely died down.

There's a reason the term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EternalSeptember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EternalSeptember">Eternal September</a> exists, and some regulars from before the mid-90s even rue the day that Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web.
</li><li> Nearly any online community, forum, or game.
</li><li> This was predicted with the Internet itself around the time US President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> was promoting "The Information Superhighway", and Vice-President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore">Al Gore</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">taking credit for inventing it</a>. While the boom in online population has greatly increased the quantity and variety of information and interest-sharing, those watching it in progress didn't feel it did any favors for the <em>quality</em>. Whether it's better or worse now that it's popular depends on the virtual neighborhood, but at least the technology permitting access has gotten faster and smoother.
</li><li> This has been the reaction of some veteran members of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest">Survival of the Fittest</a></em> following a surge of newcomers to the site.
</li><li> Quite a bit of forums were usually better before those "noobs" and "newbies" came in and ruined it all. This also includes any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Imageboards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Imageboards">*chans</a>.
</li><li> You'll probably <em>never</em> hear anyone glad that their Roleplay chatroom hosts dozens of consistent members.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a> fandom, wowaka and his songs have been experiencing this for a while, especially after one of his songs, World's End Dancehall, debuted at the top of the Vocaloid weekly rankings with an astronomical <em>1.5 million</em> points and stayed on top for two weeks straight (a rarity on the rankings).
<ul><li> Miku Hatsune suffers a lot of backlash purely for being too popular and "stealing the spotlight" from other Vocaloids. The tendency of the media to zero in on Miku rather than other Vocaloids hasn't helped matters.
</li></ul></li><li> The general consensus on 4chan is that you can tell a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme</a> has run its course when it's mentioned by a news source. Most memes which the general public knows about (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChuckNorrisFacts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChuckNorrisFacts">Chuck Norris Facts</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/LOLCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/LOLCats">LOLCats</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverNineThousand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverNineThousand">OVER 9000</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll">Rickrolling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base</a>) inspire little but groan from the average poster. However, this is somewhat justified, since 1. Memes are jokes, and these people have seen the joke everywhere by this point, and 2. Memes are usually fads, and other media usually only find out about them long after the fad has run its course.
<ul><li> It has now evolved to where a meme is hated when it reaches more mainstream image sites like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> and 9gag. These two sites in particular were very unnoticed by 4chan until their memes began appearing on them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It Got Worse</a> when 9gag began to claim the originator of all memes which led to 4chan leading a series of raids on 9gag. Posting an image from either site will be met with a constant stream of "GTFO" and "Go back to Reddit!"
</li></ul></li><li> This applies to Encyclopedia Dramatica's memes; every article on ED about a given meme complains how it got popular and is now unfunny. Logically, the ones that didn't catch on wouldn't have an article at all.
</li><li> This is also the attitude about memes from those around during the earlier days of modern Net culture (i.e. 2000-2010). Those who were around back then would use memes as inside jokes. Phrases like "Pool's Closed" were references to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Habbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Habbo">Habbo</a></em> raids as opposed to racist phrases like members of the public thought (though the penchant of the raiders to form swastikas with their avatars didn't help). But as with nerd culture, memes started going more mainstream (helped out by Hot Topic making clothing of different memes, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> featuring them on their show) until these "inside jokes" weren't inside anymore, and memes started taking on a more "flavor-of-the-month" quality as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Vine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Vine">Vine</a> grew in popularity. As such, the members of that older generation often lament how memes went from being inside jokes that had staying power to suddenly being fleeting fads that show up, get about two weeks of attention, and are never mentioned again.
</li><li> Common among certain fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChannelAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChannelAwesome">Channel Awesome</a>. While their concern is mainly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">fanwriters</a> focusing too much on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">more popular reviewers</a>, they seem to forget that fandom is a hobby and people will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">write whatever they feel like writing</a>.
<ul><li> Especially noteworthy should be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradJones">Brad Jones</a>. When you read the comments on his own website, every once in a while there is someone who claims he was so much better and funnier before he joined the CA-Crew, and that he should stop making crossovers with the other contributors, because they all suck. Various other members of the site can get this treatment as well.
</li><li> This is true for a butt-load of reviewers, really. But especially regarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">AVGN</a>, when even his OWN fans are exceptionally vicious towards him when it comes to almost anything they can imagine. The hilarious thing is, though, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">the fanbase itself can't even agree on why he sucks now without contradicting themselves</a>. i.e.: He curses too much, he doesn't curse enough, the videos are too short now, the videos are too long now, he milks the AVGN persona too much, he keeps making things other than AVGN, there's too many poop jokes, there's not as many poop jokes as there used to be. And 99% percent of them are unable to pin down any specific reason why his videos suck now, often within their own lists of criticism, and begging him to "not suck anymore" for exceptionally vague reasons (if reasons are ever listed).
</li></ul></li><li> The Harlem Shake meme. Most people detest its guts because of how viral it is - the videos are easy to produce, which makes it harder to get people to stop making them.

When the rants returned, and Ben became more popular to the point of having more subscribers and fans (a lot of them are ironically former haters), his older fans for the most part have abandoned his videos and have long unsubscribed to him for the sake of this very trope.
</li><li> The Archfiend is a YouTube ranter that frequently uses this trope. He finds it all-right that you make YouTube videos until it becomes your living (or you can live with that as a job). In fact, he frequently hates on popular YouTubers for asking money from their fans or using tactics that allow them to have a little bit more money.
<ul><li> Though he defends some popular channels as well if they have to delete videos for no legitimate reason.

</li><li> Nightcore emerged in the early 2000's as a style of speeding up slow techno songs to give them a happy hardcore-esque sound. The phenomenon initially had a small fanbase scattered throughout various online communities, but by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, it became wildly popular on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, with lots of nightcore channels being created overnight. Nightcore soon became labelled as "lazy", "uncreative", and "oversaturated". As a result, many older listeners stopped following the nightcore scene. It didn't help that many of the new channels strayed from the original happy hardcore sound, even using non-electronic genres such as rock and hip hop.

</li><li> For a while, using the Phillips CD-I games as a source for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop">YouTube Poop</a> was frowned upon by the members of the YouChew community for years now, although some people are still able to make some funny videos using them, and in more recent years members of the forum frequently make jokes involving CD-I memes, though in a more post-ironic manner.
</li><li> Every widely known social networking site (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Myspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Myspace">Myspace</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>, etc.) <em><strong>ever</strong></em>. Specifically, for Facebook, the introduction of high school and regional networks was what ruined it FOREVER!
</li><li> Early fans of Internet memes can be some of the most vitriolic out there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Dolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Dolan">Dolan</a> hipsters laud <em>even the pre-"gooby pls"</em> days, when the meme looked nothing like its current self and was all in Finnish. Doge hipsters swear allegiance to the "Daily Doge" blog from 2012, before the now-well-known "shibe" face and the associated captions ("wow", "so", "such", etc.) had become standardized.
</li><li> Online fandom and fan activity in general. There's a small but vocal group of fans who just won't shut up about how the scene is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedForever">Ruined Forever</a> whenever it gets any kind of attention from anything resembling a mainstream publication, though the fact that such coverage is very prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">Cowboy BeBop at His Computer</a> admittedly doesn't help.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> is known for having this attitude toward subs that start off small then become popular, or already popular subs that become Default (not always without reason). Generally speaking, niche subreddits tend to be civil and have smaller amounts of quality content and discussion, which decays when more and more people join. It's commonly cited that around 10,000 subscribers, a sub's quality begins to tank.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> clearly got this treatment. The more rabid parts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> accuses people who like the show as being either gay, autistic, a furry, or all of the above.
<ul><li> Within the fandom itself, there are a number of first-wave Bronies who have withdrawn from the show since Season 2, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a>.
</li><li> Some bronies that were fans of the show since the beginning disliked how the writers tried to appeal more to the new fandom after its discovery, which can seem like the case upon comparing the first and second seasons. However, the writers have revealed the second season was written long before they were even aware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>.
</li><li> A large minority of the fans who post on 4chan now refuse to call themselves 'Bronies', due to what they see as a subversion of the term caused "embarrassing people" joining the fandom; more specifically, furries and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em> fans that gave the <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> fandom such a bad reputation. It's also generally claimed that many fans have "jumped on the bandwagon" and that when <em>Friendship is Magic</em> is eventually over, most people will jump on another bandwagon, most of the remainder will eventually let it fizzle out and only the people who have made it so important to their lives that they can't let go will carry the torch.
<ul><li> The fandom entered its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomLifeCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomLifeCycle">cooldown stage</a> in early 2016, shortly after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> which drew a massive fandom of its own, and indeed, many of the fans that simply jumped on the bandwagon did jump off. But the fandom remained quite consistent up until the end of the show in 2019, and generally appears to be continuing to chug along. Many are sticking around to see if Generation 5 turns out good, but it's generally agreed nothing will ever match the initial surge in popularity the fandom had in Gen 4.
</li></ul></li><li> The popularity of the show and bronies made its way outside of the Internet to the point where most retail stores are now selling brony related merchandise. Some bronies love this while others hate it.
</li><li> Bronies also managed to invert this trope. When <em>Friendship is Magic</em> took off, the fanbase exploded - and immediately started bashing on the previous generations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> fans and shows. Fans of G1 <em>My Little Pony</em> love the new show, but if they ever mention that they were fans of the original, they immediately get insulted for liking such a "lame" show (same goes for younger fans who came on board during the G3 era, only even <em>worse</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em> experienced a wave of popularity on sites like deviantART in the hiatus between the first and second seasons, there were a number of fans that cried foul and bemoaned the show becoming popular and no longer their underground favorite, claiming that it would only attract shallow and less intelligent fans who would not appreciate it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArt">True Art</a>. After it had since become prominent enough to gain interviews on the Huffington Post, MTV News, and even earn a Playboy tie-in comic, there are fans that take it as a sign of doom and the creators "selling out".
<ul><li> Season 2 experienced an exodus of fans, similar to the My Little Pony example above as it involved a change in format that split the fanbase. While season 3 received less open flamewars and outrage, there are fans that declare themselves only fans of the "true Superjail" (season 1 and pilot) and don't get along well with people who acknowledge the later seasons (this seems to be a particularly large problem with Season 2, to the point where some fans will acknowledge every season EXCEPT 2).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> got this treatment after it skyrocketed in popularity during its second and third seasons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The live action movie</a> certainly doesn't help matters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> got this treatment when it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> in 2005, after which the popularity of the series skyrocketed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> was widely thought to be a better show prior to 1997 or so, when Homer fully eclipsed Bart as the writers' favorite character and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">the gratuitous celebrity cameos</a> started to take over the show, even to the point that the plots would often be <em>about</em> the celebrities - this, of course, despite Homer indeed being very popular with the fanbase and the celebrity cameos being a main selling point of the show almost from the beginning. However, the trope is averted when it comes to the program's very first season: even many longtime fans are embarrassed by it because its animation is so crude, its characterizations are ill-defined, and it coasts more on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">Toilet Humour</a> than on the much wittier patter and shtick of the later episodes, especially the post-1992 ones.
</li><li> Some fans say they liked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> better back during its early years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">when it was new and edgy</a>, and most kids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">had to watch the show in secret</a> since their parents had banned it from the house. Now that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a>'s highest rated show and widely popular, some people don't like it anymore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> had this treatment as well. Due to its evergrowing popularity in the earlier seasons and the movie, they decided to create more episodes after Nickelodeon Uncancelled it. The popularity might not be a good one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">since the newer episodes are labeled as being stale by many fans</a>, although this is perhaps because the show has had a different director and production team since Season 4.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> after the show skyrocketed around Season 3 plus a series of real-life incidents involving violence in response to a lack of Szechuan sauce saw a marked increase in "ruined", "never liked it anyway" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a>: The show" posts from Internet users on Twitter and 4chan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> got this treatment to a smaller degree when the show was still running, mostly by <em>SpongeBob</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> fans who felt it was unfair that their shows were getting undermined for <em>Rugrats</em> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlaskyCsupo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlaskyCsupo">Klasky-Csupo</a> shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> hit this somewhere in the latter half of Season 4 with the uprising of SU Critical on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">tumblr</a>, to the point where some people join the fanbase just to bash the show.

<ul><li> The "Kony 2012" campaign got this reaction shortly after it went viral. Although to be fair, giving only 31% of donations to the cause and oversimplifying the conflict won't keep many supporters by their side. Moreover, <a class="urllink" href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/03/kony-2012-fallout-moves-to-uganda.html">Invisible Children is being funded by hardcore Christian fundamentalist organizations.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> This revelation turned off a lot of atheist, agnostic, and liberal Internetgoers.

</li></ul></li><li> Mentioning anything related to Project Chanology (the Scientology protests) on most chan boards will now get you flamed, banned, and, possibly, your IP address posted.
</li><li> The coins for Styx's ferryman are already on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll">Rickroll</a>'s eyes, and it now lies on the pyre. All that waits now is the torch. Good night, sweet prince... at least, according to 4chan and Encyclopedia Dramatica.
</li><li> Almost any comedian who makes the transition from relative obscurity on the stand-up circuit to increased fame and public profile (most usually through the television) will lose part of her / his fanbase who will be quick to bemoan the fact that s/he is now a 'sell-out'. Apparently, some jokes become less funny the more people who are laughing at them.
</li><li> Polish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demoscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demoscene">Demoscene</a>. When the Polish videogame magazine <em>CD-Action</em> began publishing a series about the hitherto rather hermetic demoscene, many old sceners claimed that it ruined the demoscene forever, caused an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">influx of talentless newbies</a>, and were angry that while <em>they</em> had to go to great lengths to learn about the community in the first place, all those new youngsters know everything by just reading a magazine.
</li><li> A rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> example: Beautiful secluded beaches. When only you and maybe a few friends know about the location of a secluded beach, its a wonderful thing but if the wrong people find out about it, before long the word spreads around and lots of people start visiting it which means that the formerly beautiful secluded beach turns into just another busy tourist trap. <br><br>This is more to the fact that most beautiful, secluded beaches are fantastic surfing spots, mostly because you can get out onto some fantastic waves without having to worry about grommets and boogie boarders getting underboard. Here in Australia, if you find yourself in a nice secluded spot with a decent swell, the unwritten rule is that you keep it between yourselves and the locals. <br><br>At least along the Florida panhandle, there are quite a few spots owned by the state as "preserves" of sorts where nothing can be built except for the occasional public crapper. They're nearly always deserted, as the more obnoxious tourists tend to gravitate towards spots covered in souvenir shops and overpriced restaurants.
<ul><li> Can also extend to camping locations. As Yogi Berra put it: "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." (He was talking about a then-recently-famous restaurant in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis">St. Louis</a>, but same difference.)
</li></ul></li><li> This also affects beautiful secluded nature sites and landmarks usually off the beaten path outside of protected lands in the age of social media, "geotagging", and selfies. Remote places that were once hidden gems for the adventurous few will become viral bringing in lots of unexpected visitors leading to infrastructure and safety concerns.
</li><li> Two words: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Bruce Campbell</a>. Fans want him to be successful and more than a B-movie star, but at the same time they want to keep him all to themselves and hope he never gets that A-listing he deserves, because then a lot of what makes him cool will simply vanish and he'd be just another Hollywood star. As of 2012, his biggest role is one of the three leads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork">USA Network</a>'s hit show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>. His character is so popular he actually got his own spinoff movie. The fans don't seem to actually mind.
</li><li> Honda is sometimes hit with this. They used to make comparatively tiny cars that were practical, fuel efficient, and sporty, all at the same time. Now the Accord is a veritable land-yacht and the Civic is barely a compact car, and they're not particularly fun to drive. The fanboys cry that Honda has abandoned them, nevermind that Honda is a publicly traded company with a duty to maximize profits, and it's very hard to make a business case for targeting specifically a very small section of the market to the exclusion of the rest. The kicker is the Honda Fit, which is everything Honda used to stand for, all in a modern, safe package.
<ul><li> This trope sometimes plays a role for car buying in general. Some people get tired of seeing the same cars over and over again, never mind that said cars are often popular because they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">practical, fuel efficient, and easy to maintain</a>, and opt for a more obscure model that may be less reliable and it's harder to find parts for, but stands out more.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> subculture is beginning to be hit with this, even though it's only a few years old. There are purists who believe that the whole essence of Steampunk is to make everything yourself. If you so much as buy a pair of premade goggles, you're just a poser and it should never be allowed to enter the mainstream, as that would dilute it. There are others who believe that it needs to get popular or die. When it enters the mainstream, all of the stuff, goggles, brass and the like will become cheaper, possibly lessing the "Steampunks are Goths with money" mentality that many have.
</li><li> Although not exactly a fandom, many followers of various conspiracy theories seem to subscribe to this mindset; many seem to reject the official record not because they sincerely believe it's wrong and want to know the truth, but simply <em>because</em> it's the official record and has been widely accepted. These 'theorists' then cling to the alternative theories because accepting them makes them feel smarter than the 'sheeple' who accept the official record ("I'm smart enough to see The Truth and you're not!"). This can have interesting results in cases where the official 'lies' are actually more accurate and / or make more sense than the alternative theory, or the alternative theory is patently flawed and nonsensical. Although actual examples are numerous (and far too bitterly contested to be discussed in detail here), many of the alternative theories around 9/11 appear to have attracted these types.
<ul><li> Some conspiracy theorists also have a hatred for the hard left/right for this very reason, as they launch a conspiracy theory into the mainstream thought. David Icke, for instance, said that he would rather prefer being ruled over by reptilian humanoids rather than religious fanatics.
</li><li> People debunking them have also a similar mindset, Belgian conspiracy theorist Mark Peeters (known for saying that the moon landings are fake because it is impossible for a ball to get out of the orbit of the earth if thrown from the ground) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">well-liked</a> by them because at least he does not follow the common fallacies conspiracy theorists usually make. Justified, as debunking the same conspiracy for the umpteenth time really gets on your nerves.

<div class="indent"><strong>A comment on the name Seth:</strong> Cool name. It's masculine, brave, and caring, everything you could want in a boy's name. Too bad it's getting popular. <br><strong>A comment on the name Elias:</strong> ...I only hope that, with the growing popularity of Biblical names, this doesn't become popular. I hate trendy names. <br><strong>A comment on the name Aaron:</strong> This name is getting to be too common!
</div><ul><li> Keep in mind that a name being too common is a legitimate concern; if there's a class with, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">three kids named Michael, then it gets confusing</a>.

However, motoring press and the public's opinion differed on this car.

</li><li> One of Fametracker's main features was "The Fame Audit", a rather justified/averted form of this trope, where, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">as the title suggests</a>, the evaluated the relative merits and demerits of various pop-culture figures, both famous and somewhat under-the-radar, and would determine whether they were getting the appropriate amount of fame, and whether or not for the right reasons. Notable nods included a then-under-the-radar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart">Jon Stewart</a> from when he was only a year into hosting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em>, where they determined that he deserved even more fame. Cut to the Re-Audit four years later when he was already quite famous, and they not only still loved him, but wanted his fame to continue to grow. ([FT] may be gone, but the former editors are still clearly pleased with his current fame.) In spite of the clear cases where they feel are low-talent (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonStone">Sharon Stone</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnTravolta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnTravolta">John Travolta</a>) or on the wane (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> circa the 2002 audit) among other things, they are rather objective in their assessments, sometimes choosing to either leave well enough alone or suggest a bump up in fame for people they might otherwise be ambivalent about who are nonetheless unpretentious and enjoyable enough to deserve some sort of extended presence. Beyond that, they have recommended that stars they have liked stay at their exact same spot of fame lest they become too overexposed or pushed into overly high-profile projects (see: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillFerrell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillFerrell">Will Ferrell</a> and Steven Soderbergh via their audits), or consequently a bump down for said cases either already beyond that point (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a>'s audit) or simply in need of going away in order to refocus (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LisaKudrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LisaKudrow">Lisa Kudrow</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardNorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardNorton">Edward Norton</a>).
</li><li> When the Netherlands decriminalized marijuana, its use among teenagers dropped from a rather low 11% to 8%. Guess we know who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">just trying to be a rebel</a>. Then it became common knowledge that the Netherlands had legalized weed and suddenly, the tourists came in like a tidal wave seeking legal pot. This has caused considerable backlash among people who find the idea that the Netherlands' biggest draw may be for drug tourism a mite embarrassing, in addition to the problems (perceived and actual) that these foreigners cause. In 2012, a law was passed which forbade tourists from getting cannabis at <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeeshop_(Netherlands)">cannabis coffee shops<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> nationwide, and restricted the purchase of cannabis among citizens to those carrying a "pot pass". However, actual enforcement of this law has proven to be a bit hit-or-miss. In Amsterdam, for instance, foreigners can come in and purchase pot from a coffeeshop without discrimination or legal repercussion, whereas some smaller towns and villages in more rural parts of the country, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeCantHaveNiceThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeCantHaveNiceThings">its banned across the board, for everyone.</a>
</li><li> Actually, its not uncommon for some people to stop pushing for any progressive cause once it gains legal status, to the point of backing away from vocally supporting it. The 2010s backlash against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie">Soapbox Sadie</a> may have its roots in this, with activists being now perceived as hypocrites often just motivated by money.
</li><li> Apart from this, the popular belief of societies and cultures becoming more liberal with the pass of time has been defied in a few occasions. It can be pointed out that the higher push for "decency" in the 2010s can be linked to the extreme liberalism of previous years. The 1980s "conservative revolution" is arguably a better example of this.
</li><li> Happens constantly in politics. When a politician is polling at 5%, they can be a political gadfly, constantly taking principled, unpopular stances. Once they get up to 40% and there's a chance they could actually <em>win</em>, their activist base will often accuse them of turning into just another politician.
</li><li> Hipsters. Their entire shtick is "I liked X before X was cool!" If X becomes even the least bit popular, they decry it. Saying that the creators have now "sold out".
</li><li> Fixed gear bicycles used to be the domain of weirdbeards and bicycle couriers. Hipsters adopted them because they liked the courier aesthetic and fixies immediately became uncool. Now that the fad's mostly died off, the same weirdbeards and couriers are still riding their bikes, but now it's easier for them to get parts.
</li><li> Nerd subculture. With superhero films and genre works becoming more and more mainstream, video games being played by every boy in the country, and "nerd" protagonists becoming more common in TV shows and movies, some nerds are rather upset. This is understandable to an extent: when you've been mocked and ostracized for years because you like X, it can be rather jarring when X becomes popular and the people who previously mocked X fans now obsess over X themselves. As a result, a lot of long-term nerds have gotten defensive against new fans. Female newbies tend to be disproportionately attacked, since the "nerd" subculture was seen as a guy's thing for such a long time, so <em>obviously</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">a girl couldn't be interested in anything nerdy unless she was just doing it to seem cool</a>. They also have some troubles with hipsters in general for appropriating their lifestyle and making it mainstream.
<ul><li> An increasingly common criticism towards mainstreaming of nerds and geeks is the tendency for a lot of self styled nerds/geeks to base their qualifications on passionate interest in topics that are solely entertainment oriented as opposed to topics that require above average intelligence, technical skills, and serious study well above and beyond the layman's level. Being a fan of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience">Websites like this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> just won't cut it when compared to a real scientist.
</li><li> It probably doesn't help that movies depicting a nerd as a hero still routinely make use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerd</a> types, tend to have the nerdy hero end up with a girl way out of his league, and often because he rose "above" his nerdiness to attract her. Shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> make heavy use out of the idea that all nerds are socially awkward and <em>want</em> to be accepted by the "in-crowd", when in fact, most nerds are perfectly capable of social interaction and are perfectly happy being nerds.
</li></ul></li><li> In the similar note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention">fan conventions</a>, as they are physical spaces which can be negatively impacted by overcrowding. Hosting organizations can be overwhelmed in trying to accommodate greater attendance, and expanding themselves as a response leads to the risk of oversights that can severely disrupt the organizations' efforts. The actual building which a convention is hosted in may not be built for larger crowds, which leads to safety issues such as fire hazards and stampeding. Even the surrounding community (especially hotels) may become wary of the debauchery that comes with each con. Meanwhile, attendees would have greater difficulty socializing - or even moving about - in a crowded convention hall, and lines are more likely to be an issue. With these factors, a greater attendance means a greater likelihood that older attendees won't be able to tolerate the aforementioned factors, and give up those conventions.
<ul><li> In addition, many conventions, when they become big enough, will expand their scope beyond what their initial focus due to drawing the attention of fans of other things. This can result in cries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a> from people who were fans before or people who aren't fans of the expanded topics. San Diego Comic Con is a good example of this, as it's now more famous for its panels on TV shows and movies than for comic books, leaving some comic book fans pretty upset. This can even extend to behavior of fans at conventions: For instance, some hardcore anime fans are upset that Anime Expo is full of anime fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cosplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cosplay">cosplaying</a> characters from western media, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Can happen to countries as well. When Japan and Japanese culture got popular amongst anime fans, people started to bash Japan by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">bringing up Pearl Harbor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">heavily exaggerating the country's flaws</a>.
<ul><li> The inverse has happened as well: With Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics, anime fans got upset over the immense boost in tourism to Japan it would bring in.
</li></ul></li><li> Noam Chomsky argues that this happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a> when Emperor Constantine became a convert. In his words, "Constantine shifted it so the cross, which was the symbol of persecution of somebody working for the poor, was put on the shield of the Roman Empire. It became the symbol for violence and oppression, and that's pretty much what the church has been until the present."
</li><li> There are people who don't like wines like Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, or Chardonnay because those wines are so popular. They argue that this is, unusually, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> example, because, since those wines are so popular, the market has been flooded, including with many bad versions. This is not to say that there are no good ones, but it is impossible to tell just by looking at the bottle, so unless you have reason to be confident in a particular vineyard and year, it's a crapshoot. By contrast, with a less popular variety, the argument goes, one can safely assume that that wine would not have made it to the shelf of your local shop at all unless it were a particularly good example of that wine, precisely because it is not a popular variety. There are also those who argue that with less well-known varieties, you are at least more likely to get something surprising and interesting, rather than just another Cabernet or Merlot, even if it is a good one. Not everyone agrees with this reasoning, of course: there are plenty of people who will say that this is just post-hoc rationalization for not liking certain wines just because they are popular.
</li><li> Message boards/forums will always have veteran members that have been around in the early days of the site and said members will have formed a tight-knit community. If the site gets more popular or opens itself up to more people, veteran members will decry that the newfound popularity makes the site less appealing since everyone is trying have their voices heard or are ruining the once small and close community.
</li><li> Justified for dog breeds (or pets in general, if animals such as rabbits or rodents are to be taken into account). As demand increases, breeding increases which leads to more inbreeding and genetic problems also leads to less responsible breeding and puppy mills. One widely-publicised example was when the 1996 live-action remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians1996">101 Dalmatians</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredAndTwoDalmatians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneHundredAndTwoDalmatians">sequel</a> was released. Children <em>begged</em> their parents to buy them a "spotty dog" after seeing them in the films, not knowing how much of a <em>pain in the ass</em> a Dalmatian would be in the hands of an inexperienced owner, leading to <a class="urllink" href="http://cinema.com/news/item/103/activists-protest-disney-dalmations.phtml">protests<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by animal rights groups over the unwanted attention the films brought to the breed. Similar concerns about well-meaning owners joining in on "pet fads" and eventually abandoning them may have led <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> series creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh to portray Perry as a platypus owing to its relative obscurity compared to mainstream animals. While not directly naming <em>Dalmatians</em>, Marsh <a class="urllink" href="https://www.looper.com/163473/the-untold-truth-of-phineas-and-ferb">stated<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that in an interview "We wanted to pick an animal that kids couldn't go pick out at a pet store and beg for." The animal's obscurity also gave the series creators more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">flexibility</a> with the character; despite this, Perry nevertheless became popular for all the right reasons.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">Goth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">Emo</a> subcultures. Aside from suffering from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">The New Rock &amp; Roll</a>, after that stigma had passed, these groups are made fun of by outsiders who hate how surprisingly expansive they've become. Goths get targeted for being either perpetually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">sad</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear">angry</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">openly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">violent</a> (the latter of which stemming from crimes incorrectly attributed to goths). Emos are attacked for having a similar aesthetic, but being infinitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">whinier</a>. There's also the stereotype that teenagers turn to these subcultures as a result of teen angst, and that these are just a phase. The fact that stores like Hot Topic specialize in merchandise appealing to these groups doesn't help.
<ul><li> Hot Topic, in turn, also suffers from this. People who aren't part of the goth or emo subcultures hate how the store promotes them. On the other hand, abiding by this trope, actual goths and emos hate Hot Topic because it became "mainstream"; this resulted in jokes about "mall goths" who are just wannabe "poseurs" who think that just because you shop at Hot Topic, that makes you goth. (Granted, there are probably plenty of cases of this, but not as many as people claim.)
</li></ul></li><li> In cities that get a lot of tourism, locals have a tendency to avoid the popular, touristy areas of the city, bashing said areas as being full of cheesy tourist traps. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">Times Square</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">Fisherman's Wharf</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Hollywood</a> are notorious for this.
</li><li> The Hippie movement was "declared dead" by mid-1967. Yes, that was exactly the time which most people associate with the start of the hippie movement. However, being an "alternative lifestyle", it can't simultaneously be popular with member of the mainstream public.
</li><li> The Afro. Influenced by the "Black Is Beautiful" cultural movement, which saw Africans and African-Americans embrace African traditions as a means of resisting assimilation and integration into the predominantly white societies of the Western world of the 1960's, the Afro became a symbol of rebellion against racism and the demand to conform to Western cultural norms. Eventually, it became part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and was thus adopted by a number of notable African-American celebrities to show their support of the movement, and people started wearing Afros of gigantic proportions. However, as it became more popular in the mainstream&mdash;to the point where it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">being adopted by people not of African ancestry</a>&mdash;it became considerably less popular among African-Americans, and was largely a thing of the past by the end of the 1970's. Now, most people see the hair style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAfro">as a goofy anachronism</a>, though smaller and less outrageous versions still see some popularity.
</li><li> Justified when it comes to going to a live concert, for basically the same reasons as any place where large crowds suck. Depending on the band's popularity, tickets could be sold out within a matter of days or hours. And chances are a good portion of those tickets were bought up by scalpers to be sold on resale sites at ludicrously marked up prices. Assuming you got a decent ticket at a decent price, you still have to deal with traffic, huge crowds, and trying to find a parking lot that doesn't charge an insane amount to park there (and some cabs and ride-sharing services will increase their rates if they know you're going to said concert). Of course, some people might find all this worth it, but it's easy to see why some people might get upset when their favorite band suddenly takes off in popularity.
</li><li> When MoviePass started it charged users $35-$45 a month for a movie ticket a day, though its membership plateaued out around 20,000 subscribers, and in late 2017 its new parent company slashed the subscription price to $10 a month, attracting over three million new subscribers. The service was once known for its reliability and strong customer service, but buckled under the load, in part by many of its new users buying tickets <a class="urllink" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/moviepass-scammers-poop-popcorn-vengence">far more often than expected<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and by July 2018 it had to suspend service when it ran out of cash. The company had to institute a slew of new and constantly changing rules to curb its large user base such as requiring pictures of ticket stubs and surge pricing, and eventually limited users to three tickets a month and only supporting 5-6 titles a day with major releases blocked out for several weeks.
</li><li> Beats by Dr. Dre. While generally regarded as good-sounding headphones, most people also agree that they aren't <em>nearly</em> high-quality enough to warrant their high price, and that half of its retail cost is only justified by the brand. Audiophiles in particular will deride them for being mediocre when asked about them, and go on about how the only reason they're so popular is because they look good, and that you can find better sounding headphones for around the same price from other companies.
</li><li> Heck, even time periods and civilisations aren't safe:
<ul><li> Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome for how romanticised and glorified they're in pop culture. People praise them for being the cradle of western civilization and providing the world with philosophers, theatrical plays and the Olympic Games. And then, you have those who will remind you of its bad side: class systems, people dying early of diseases we nowadays have proper treatment for, slavery, democracy only for rich upperclass males citizens, bloody battles etc.
<ul><li> Specifically speaking, the Ancient Spartan culture receives this treatment a lot. Thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCultureOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCultureOsmosis">Pop Culture Osmosis</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a> was, it has become extremely popular to modern people and thus, getting a lot of praise. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Three" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Three">Three</a></em> was explicitly created to showcase some of its nastiest parts and that it isn't a good idea to idolise it.

Although he is only concerned that enjoying Tolkien's trilogy will make it (gasp!) mainstream to be a nerd, therefore depriving people like himself of their "special" status.

</li><li> Used in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Phonogram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Phonogram">Phonogram</a></em>; since the series is about a group of magicians who are not only indie-music snobs, but basically derive their magical power <em>from</em> their indie-music snobbery, there's naturally a lot of this about. A quick read of each issue's crib sheets gives a few hints that the authors of the series might not be entirely free of this mindset either. There's a reasonable amount of self-awareness about it, however, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in the first arc essentially revolves around the main character, if not exactly deciding to abandon this mindset, then at least deciding to be a bit less of an insufferable dick about it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic's</a> editorial "Can Hype Kill a Good Film?", citing the example of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> above. He brings up the point that, if a work of fiction is less well known, a fan of it can feel a bit more unique for knowing about it and feel a stronger connection with other fans of the same because it's not ingrained in the public consciousness.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>:
<ul><li> This comes up in the very first episode, "The Curse of Dethklok", when the band plays the "Duncan Hills Coffee Jingle" a reporter asks, "Is Dethklok selling out?" to which Nathan denies and insists that they're just trying to make coffee metal because they want to make everything metal.
</li><li> Parodied in S2 Ep03, "Tributeklok". Dethklok is decried by fans when they refuse to play at a gig they won't make any money off of, and after they do an endorsement for chewing gum, a little boy spits in Nathan's face and calls them sellouts. The band members decide they need to get back in touch with their rock n roll roots which consists of joining their own tribute band and doing nothing that the successful Dethklok would do (not eating fancy food, only using amateur made fliers to advertise their shows, living in poor conditions). However, when they decide to play the gig that they refused to play before, (since it's the opposite of what they would do) the same little boy from earlier calls them sellouts again, saying the real Dethklok would never play it. Deciding it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">no win situation</a> they decide to just go back to being wealthy and successful.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when Vrunkus trashes his <em>own</em> music as soon as it's complimented by a commercially successful musician:
<div class="indent"><strong>Vrunkus:</strong> Do you <em>liiiike</em> it? <br><strong>Pickles:</strong> I dunno, it's okay. <br><strong>Vrunkus:</strong> Then I hate it.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied in Season 2 Episode 09, "Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls" which focused on film snobbery about independent films being better simply because of the "independent" label: "If you work in the entertainment industry, and you make money, you're a sellout."
</li><li> Parodied in Season 3's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS3E11Chinpokomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS3E11Chinpokomon">Chinpokomon</a>", where the parents thwart the plan of the Japanese toy sellers to brainwash the children with the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Chinpokomon</a> toys by buying the toys themselves, hence making the kids think the toys now suck (although this is more because "Adults are uncool and lame, so anything they like must also be uncool and lame" than this trope).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, Lance joins a band, then gets kicked off after his appearances draw a huge crowd.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "The Day The Earth Stood Cool" dealt with a "cool" new family moving in next door bringing in lifestyles like breastfeeding, retro fashion and natural substances. Springfield gets overrun by these hipster types and are adopting their lifestyles. When New York Times declared Springfield the "coolest city", all the cool people moved out when the town has been "played out".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a>'s It's Only Rock and Roll</em> special (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith">The One with...</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackstreetBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackstreetBoys">Backstreet Boys</a>), Francine has this opinion on Backstreet, that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">only in it for the money</a> and not for the art, (not to mention Muffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirl</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squee">ing</a>), which she sticks to for the whole special.
