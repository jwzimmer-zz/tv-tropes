</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Evil Parent</strong>: The child is blameless (or at least not guilty of anything deserving of death); the parent just wants to dispose of the child for some reason. Maybe there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">prophecy</a> about the kid coming back and killing the parent and the parent figures "It's me or them"; maybe the parent has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">keep a pact</a> made with a dark power in which the child's life is the price; maybe the child is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">The Un-Favourite</a>; maybe the child was born as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyCouldntYouBeDifferent">an unacceptable nonconformist</a>; Whatever the reason, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">mother</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">father</a> is ultimately just a murderer.
</li><li> <strong>Evil Offspring</strong>: In this scenario, the parent actually does love the child, at least a little, but there's something seriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">wrong</a> about that kid. The parent may be the only one who can stop the child or perhaps feels responsible for doing the deed personally.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>The Choice of Abraham</strong>: The parent loves the child. The child loves the parent. But some other overwhelming force is demanding a sacrifice. Maybe God is testing Abraham. Maybe the Nazis are making Sophie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">choose.</a> Regardless, no one wants this, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">going to happen anyway.</a>
</li><li> <strong>Accidental Murder</strong>: Maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByMistake">they were trying to kill someone else</a>, or maybe a chain of unfortunate accidents stemmed from their actions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">led to their child's death</a>. In any case, they never wanted it, it just happened.
</li></ul><p>In the worst case scenario, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSapientSpeciesTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSapientSpeciesTropes">entire species</a> will be like this, in that case, you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveAlienParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveAlienParents">Abusive Alien Parents</a>.
</p><p>Sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">there have been many cases of real-life parents</a> &mdash; both mothers and fathers &mdash; who murder their own children. In case you are wondering, the technical term for this kind of murder is "filicide".
</p><p>For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>/opposite of this trope, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">Self-Made Orphan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Patricide">Patricide</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matricide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matricide">Matricide</a>. A subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInTheFamily">Murder in the Family</a>.
</p><p>Usually also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>, as most examples have the offspring be younger than a teenager. Otherwise, it doesn't overlap.

<ul><li> Because Cronus had been prophesied to be overthrown by one of his children, he ate all of his offspring alive, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Zeus</a> who was saved by his mother. Though as they were gods, this didn't kill them. They matured inside his stomach.
</li><li> Cronus' father Ouranos had earlier shoved Cronus' siblings into Tartarus.
</li><li> Zeus himself ate one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">many consorts</a> when she was pregnant, as a male child by her was prophesied to be greater than Zeus himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">That one backfired, tho,</a> thankfully the child born was Athena, who, being a daughter instead of a son was <em>not</em> greater than Zeus, and a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">Daddy's Girl</a>.
</li><li> Zeus also killed his son Iason out of anger for sleeping the goddess Demeter (who also had been Zeus's lover... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">and sister, of course</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few parents of Greek heroes tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> by having their children killed. Of course, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>, this frequently backfired.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing">Oedipus the King</a></em>: Oedipus' father, King Laius, pierced his feet and left him on a hill to die, in attempt to prevent him from fulfilling the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.

</li><li> Perseus' grandfather Acrisius locked the newborn and his mother Danae in a trunk and set them out to sea since it was prophesied that kid would kill him when he grew up. With a little help from the Gods, they were saved by drifting to an island, and Perseus would grow into one of the most famous heroes of Greek myths.
</li></ul></li><li> Other characters from Classical Mythology killed their own children for vengeance, madness, to appease the gods or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>:
<ul><li> To bring shame on the gods, Tantalus had his own son Pelops killed and cooked to serve him to the gods (the boy was later restored to life, though).
</li><li> Heracles famously was driven insane by his stepmother, Hera, which led to him killing his first wife Megara and their children. The myths vary on how many children, but the best-known account is that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a>'s play <em>Heracles</em> which describes three sons.
</li><li> Phaedra, the second wife of Theseus, was attracted to her stepson Hippolytus and after declaring her love to him (or <em>raping</em> him in some versions) she felt so ashamed and fearful that he might tell his father that she accused him of raping her. Theseus believed her and cursed his son, asking Poseidon to kill him. Poseidon was his bud and so he caused Hippolytus' horses to go wild and drag the poor guy to his death. The story is told in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hippolytus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hippolytus">Hippolytus</a></em>.
</li><li> When Meleager was born, the Fates predicted he would only live until a brand, burning in the family hearth, was consumed by fire. Overhearing them, his mother Althaea immediately doused and hid the brand. When he grew up, Meleager killed his uncles Iphicles and Eurypylus (Althaea's brothers) in an argument; Althaea was so pissed that ran back to the house, retrieved the brand from it's hiding place, and put it on the fire, killing her son.
</li><li> In his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Metamorphoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a></em>, Ovid tells the story of Queen Procne of Thracia: Her husband, King Tereus, raped Procne's younger sister, Philomela, and then cut out her tongue so she couldn't tell anyone. Philomela weaved the event onto a tapestry, which she showed to Procne; Procne, in a fit of anger, killed Itys, (her son by Tereus), and served him to his father for dinner.
</li><li> Cepheus and Cassiopeia, who had offended the Nereids, were willing to sacrifice their daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Andromeda</a> to a sea monster, either their kingdom would be destroyed by it. To the parents' relieve, however, Perseus killed the monster and saved Andromeda.
</li><li> Agamemnon ordered the sacrifice of his own daughter Iphigenia to obtain the Gods' favor on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">Greek campaign to Troy.</a> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a>, Iphigenia was spirited away by the Gods to the Taurians at the last minute, but in the older version, the sacrifice was indeed carried out. The sacrifice of Iphigenia is also often given as the original reason for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Clytemnestra's grudge</a> against her husband, which later led to her murder of Agamemnon. As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCartoonHistoryOfTheUniverse">The Cartoon History of the Universe</a></em> put it:
<div class="indent"><strong>Narration:</strong> Torn between duty to brother, love of daughter, sympathy for wife, and fear of army, Agamemnon tricked Clytemnestra into bringing Iphigenia to the sacrifice. <br><strong>Clytemnestra:</strong> (<em>visibly angrily walking away</em>) You haven't heard the last of this, boy! <br><strong>Agamemnon:</strong> (<em>running from the altar, arms open</em>) But Clytemnestra!
</div></li><li> Ironically, Clytemnestra later treated her <em>other</em> daughter Electra like crap because she would not forget her father. In the tragedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Electra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Electra">Electra</a></em>, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedRoomInTheMiddleOfNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedRoomInTheMiddleOfNowhere">gets the poor girl locked away in a cave to die of starvation and thirst</a>.
<ul><li> Totally his own fault, too, as he only needed to sacrifice Iphigenia because he had angered the goddess Artemis before. He really should have known better than to insult a goddess. And also he started the war to a certain extent so it's not like he was forced into that situation.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Medea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Medea">Medea</a></em>, the eponymous Taurian princess killed her own children by Jason when she learned that Jason planned to leave her for another woman.
</li></ul></li><li> According to history and myth, Lucius Brutus (Ancestor of the assassin Marcus Junius Brutus) the founder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a> did this. Two of his sons worked defected to Tarquin. In order to prove that the Republic played no favorites, Lucius Brutus was forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">Make an Example of Them</a> and ordered the death of his own sons.
</li><li> Examples from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> Subverted in the so-called "Binding of Isaac": God orders Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac; but when Abraham is just about to go through with it, an angel appears and grabs his hand, revealing that it was only a test. It's also a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> in that God has already explicitly said to Abraham that <em>Isaac</em> will be the son through whom his descendants are counted (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genesis">Genesis</a> 21:12). Funnily enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a> tells the same story...only it's Ishmael who gets trussed up, rather than Isaac. No mention is made of "the son who counts", however.
</li><li> Played straight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen Athaliah</a>, except in this case it's Grandchildren Genocide. She tried to kill off all the heirs to her son Ahaziah's throne (in those times the queen was the mother, not the wife of the king) to seize power. Only one, Jehoash survived.
</li><li> Played with somewhat when Jephthah made a promise to God that he would give Him the first thing that came out of his door to greet him as a burnt offering if God would give him the victory over his enemies. And, as it turned out, the first thing that did greet Jephthah when he came home from his victory was his only daughter. "And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year."
</li><li> Endorsed in Deuteronomy 21:18-21: parents are allowed to bring their incorrigibly disobedient children to the elders of the city to stone them to death.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>: The Mesopotamian god / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> Apsu tries to slaughter all of his descendants, including his immediate offspring, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnumaElish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnumaElish">En&ucirc;ma Eli&#154;</a></em>. After they kill him in self-defense, his mate Tiamat picks up where he left off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeMyopia">even though she's the one</a> who tried to stop Apsu and then warned them of his attack. She also ends up killed by the younger gods.
</li><li> An old Welsh tradition about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">"King" Arthur</a>, related as early as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HistoriaBrittonum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HistoriaBrittonum">Historia Brittonum</a></em>, is that he killed a son of his own called Amr. The circumstances are not known, but possibly this is the root for the later tradition that Arthur killed his own son Mo(r)dred (in the process being himself mortally wounded). Note that with Mordred at least this was Type 2.
</li><li> Germanic heroic legend has the story of the hero Hildebrand who returned to his native land after thirty years of exile: When, on a reconnaissance mission, he ran into an enemy warrior, he was challenged to combat. He realized that the hostile warrior was his own son Hadubrand, but Hadubrand, who thought Hildebrand was dead, accused him of being an impostor and forced him to fight for his life. It ended with Hildebrand inflicting a deadly wound on his own son. Hildebrand's tragic fight with Hadubrand is the subject of the oldest surviving piece of German heroic poetry, "Hildebrandslied" ("Lay of Hildebrand"). In the 13th century, an alternate version arose that provided a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding">Happy Ending</a> by letting Hadubrand survive.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Celtic Mythology</a></em>: Cu Chulainn's illegitimate son Connla had three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas">Geas</a> placed on him. He must never turn back on a journey, must never turn down a challenge, and must never give his name. One day, Connla decided to go on a quest to meet his father for the first time. When he finally met Cu Chulainn, he was challenged to a fight for refusing to introduce himself. Cu Chulainn only figured out who he was fighting after Connla was killed, and was struck with grief.

One of the more justified examples, as Horus at that point had just led a daemon-empowered invasion of Terra, ripped the Imperium apart in civil war that had claimed <em>trillions</em> of lives, corrupted half of his brothers, killed one of his brothers who remained loyal to the Emperor, consorted with daemons, destroyed multiple planets, laid siege to the Emperor's palace and was at that moment trying to eviscerate the Emperor. As with everything, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> justifies a trope, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">doesn't do it by halves.</a> It says a lot about how much the Emperor loved Horus that none of that was actually enough to force the Emperor to kill Horus. Even as he was being torn apart, he still hoped that Horus could be redeemed. Then a lone soldier (who prior to retcons, was an ordinary human being with absolutely no chance of hurting Horus) stood before Horus in a futile attempt to defend the Emperor. Horus casually flayed the man alive with a glance. This cold-blooded murder is what finally convinced the Emperor that Horus needed to die. So the mortally wounded Emperor launched a psychic attack of such power that it obliterated Horus and sent the four Chaos gods who had possessed Horus screaming back to the Warp.

Hoyt killed all five of her biological children; she also had an adopted son, who stayed alive. Tinning is suspected in the deaths of seven of her eight biological children (one died from meningitis) and one she adopted, but she was only convicted of murdering the last one.
</li><li> Darlie Routier was convicted as the murderer of her two young sons Damond and Devon, but a lack of any clear motive and numerous errors discovered in the evidence used against her in court has led many people to believe that she is innocent. The answer remains unknown.
</li><li> Judith Barsi, the original voice of Ducky (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime">The Land Before Time</a></em>) and Anne Marie (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllDogsGoToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllDogsGoToHeaven">All Dogs Go to Heaven</a></em>), was killed by her father three months before the former film's release.
</li><li> Jennifer Hudson's nephew, Julian King, was found shot to death in a white SUV days after his grandma and uncle were murdered. Julian's stepfather, William "Flex" Balfour, has been charged with the crime.

</li><li> Ivan IV of Russia, popularly known as Ivan the Terrible, struck his son Ivan Ivanovich on the head with his scepter during a heated argument, accidentally killing him. This also had a nasty side-effect of ending the Rurik dynasty's 700+ years rule in Russia, since his second son and successor Feodor died childless and his last son Dimitri was killed soon after his father's death.
</li><li> Also in Russia, Peter I (Peter the Great) had his eldest son Alexei tortured and killed

</li><li> Deborah and Timothy Nicholls are a rare instance of <em>both</em> parents doing this. They were drug addicts in severe debt to a drug-dealing motorcycle gang, so set their house on fire with their three kids inside (whom they had doused gasoline onto) to collect on their life insurance...only to learn afterward that they had never purchased insurance for the kids in the first place. Initially, only Timothy was charged for the murders, but Deborah was also convicted a few years later when evidence popped up. Both received life sentences.

It's not clear why neither woman chose to simply allow their children's fathers to have the kids; both fathers expressed the wish to have gotten custody rather than dead children.
<ul><li> Penny Boudreau killed her twelve-year-old daughter Karrisa because her boyfriend did not want to be a father specifically to <em>her</em>, as the strained relationship she and her mother had irritated him greatly. Again, it is unclear why she simply did not give her daughter to her ex.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Garner">Margaret Garner<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was an escaped slave who, in 1856, murdered her two-year-old daughter and attempted to murder her other children to prevent them from being returned to slavery. Dubbed "The Modern Medea", there was a debate, then and now, over whether or not she was justified in mercy-killing her child. Her case served as the inspiration for a major plot point in the novel <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beloved</span></em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debora_Green">Dr. Debora Green<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was convicted of setting fire to her house, killing two of her three children (the other escaped unharmed), as well as poisoning her estranged husband several times with ricin (he survived&mdash;barely).
</li><li> During the persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe brought on by an unofficial crusade (led by a monk between Urban II's call to crusade and the sanctioned departure time of the First Crusade), there were stories of Jewish women killing their children to avoid their dying a worse death or being forcibly converted.
</li><li> In Oregon, Angela McAnulty tortured and starved her teenage daughter, Jeanette, to death in 2009. She was sentenced to death.
</li><li> During the early 1980s, California single mom Theresa Knorr tortured and starved her teenage daughters Suesan and Sheila to death, then dumped the bodies in remote locations. Suesan's death was particularly bizarre: she'd been shot in the chest by her mother but recovered, and some time later developed sepsis when Knorr tried to remove the bullet and was subsequently burned alive. The girls' bodies remained unidentified for nearly a decade until their surviving sister came forward with the bizarre stories of their deaths. Theresa Knorr was subsequently sentenced to two consecutive life terms. The story has been profiled on TV series such as <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCaseFiles">Cold Case Files</a></em> and <em>Deadly Women</em> and in a best-selling book, <em>Mother's Day</em>, by Dennis McDougal.
</li><li> Julia Maesa, the grandmother of the Roman emperors Elagabal and Alexander Severus, had the former and his mother - that is, her daughter - killed. This may have been done for the good of the empire and the dynasty: Elagabal was both a religious fanatic and a heedless hedonist (not contradictory in ancient times!), and his mother was enabling him. By contrast, Alexander Severus was a serious boy who seemed cut out for rulership, even if he would need a regency (led, of course, by Julia Maesa). It didn't work out&mdash;serious boy or no, he was dominated by his grandmother and then his own mother, which made him unpopular with the legions, and when it came time for him to go to war, he was assassinated by a military conspiracy. This not only ended the Severan dynasty but brought on the Crisis of the Third Century (the darkest time in Roman imperial history before the collapse of the Western Empire).
</li><li> One of the disappeared children shown in the <em>Runaway Train</em> video by Soul Asylum was a young girl who turned out to be a victim of this. Her parents were in a bitter custody dispute, and her mother preferred to kill and then bury the girl in her backyard rather than to risk "losing" her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DateMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DateMasamune">Date Masamune</a> nearly became a victim of this. His mother hated him because he lost one eye due to smallpox. When he was <em>23-25</em> years old, after he had succeeded as the daimyo, he was nearly poisoned to death by said mother, who wanted to put his little brother to the position instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Liu Bei</a> did this to his adopted son Liu Feng, after the latter both failed to aid the general Guan Yu and was unable to hold on to his newly conquered territory. To be fair to Liu Feng, he didn't have the forces necessary to aid Guan Yu, and he was both outnumbered and betrayed from within when he tried to defend his territory. Liu Feng was also a potential future rival to Liu Bei's blood-related son Liu Shan (he had gained a reputation for being a reliable and capable military commander, while Shan had no real accomplishments to his name), and so there is a strong argument that Liu Bei decided to take Feng's failures as an opportunity to nip a potential succession crisis in the bud.
</li><li> Herod the Great had no fewer than three of his own sons put to death for allegedly plotting against him.
</li><li> Constantin the Great put his sons to death for plotting against him.
</li><li> Practiced in a roundabout way by the Ottoman Royalty: In order to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crises</a>, the crown prince was allowed (indeed, encouraged) to off his brothers, and the whole practice was very strictly codified in the legal system. In essence, though he did not do the actual killing, the Sultan knew that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne">There Can Be Only One</a> and implicitly agreed for his other sons to be killed when he picked his successor. In an ironic twist of fate, the abolishment of the system and the subsequent measures to <em>prevent</em> the princes from killing each other by placing them under strict security led to a string of Sultans who had grown up out of touch with the world and drove the empire to the ground at a time it was facing new challenge from Europe and desperately needed strong, experienced leaders.
</li><li> Probable in the case of many child victims of the mass murder/suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. Additionally, high-ranking People's Temple member Sharon Amos and her three children died in Georgetown that same day by the same knife. Available evidence indicates that Amos killed her two younger children, ages 11 and 10, by herself. Then, 21-year-old daughter Liane assisted Mom's suicide before killing herself.
</li><li> Supposedly, the ruling families of Carthage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2a1wu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2a1wu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2a1wu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The city was an oligarchic republic</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">sacrificed</a> their own children to their god Milkqart ("King of the City") in times of extreme crisis. The symbolism was that all families lost equally.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine</a> Empress Irene did this to her son, Constantine VI, in 797 in order to get an exclusive hold on power.
</li><li> For further proof of how cruel Mother Nature herself can be, many animals have been known to participate in killing their own children. Oddly enough, with animals it's often more of a necessary evil than an act of malice&mdash;it's no coincidence that this behavior is more common among animals who tend to have more than one offspring at a time and not enough food to feed all of them, let alone themselves. For these animals, killing or abandoning one baby is a small price to pay if it means that the other baby (or babies) survives to adulthood.
</li><li> Donna Scrivo drugged her 32-year-old son Ramsey with Xanax and then strangled him to death. After that, she dismembered him and disposed the parts on the side of a road. She is sentenced to life in prison. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3086949/Woman-guilty-murder-death-dismemberment-adult-son.html">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Queen Fredegunda of Neustrian Franks choked her daughter Rigunth between a chest and its lid.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://web.kitsapsun.com/archive/2000/11-10/0026_spokane_murder__dad_sentenced_to_.html">William Brad Jackson<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> murdered his 9-year old daughter Valerie so as to get back together with his girlfriend, with whom she didn't get along. Even worse, the girl's mother disappeared 9 years earlier and he is strongly suspected of having murdered her as well.
</li><li> In February 2012, Joshua Powell, the main suspect on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">the disappearance and probable murder</a> of his wife <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Susan_Powell">Susan Cox<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, grabbed his estranged sons from a social worker during a supervised visit and blew up his house in a murder-suicide; autopsies on the boys revealed they were attacked with a hatchet before the house exploded. It is believed that the reason he murdered his sons was to prevent them from revealing the location of their mother's body, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">keep him from getting a death sentence</a>. The police have since stated that they believe Joshua killed Susan and appeals to declare her dead have begun.
</li><li> On one tragic Father's Day in Australia, Robert Farquharson drove his car with his three sons in the back seat into a dam and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInASinkingCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInASinkingCar">left them there to drown</a>, all because he hated them. He got three life sentences. His ex-wife (and the mother of the boys) became an activist against domestic violence.
</li><li> In another Australian example, John Edwards shot his two teenage children after years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> towards them and their mother in July 2018, before turning the gun on himself. His devastated ex-wife eventually committed suicide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">out of grief</a>.
</li><li> A few of the above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> examples are based on the real-life practice of infant exposure. While directly murdering a child was considered barbarous, leaving the infant exposed to the elements would leave their ultimate fate to the gods and thus was used to get rid of unwanted children. Passerby could and did adopt exposed infants, but many others would pick up exposed children to be used as slaves.
</li><li> In the U.S. there is considerable effort made toward warning parents how quickly the temperature in a parked car can reach lethal levels, especially in summer. This comes after a rash of incidents in which parents would leave their kids in the car while buying groceries or whatever, and come back to a hot car and a dead kid. A few such cases have even been prosecuted as intentional murder.
