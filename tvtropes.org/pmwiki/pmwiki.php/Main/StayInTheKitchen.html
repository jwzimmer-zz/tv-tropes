Women currently require roughly half of the physical requirements of men, but combat pushes even those men past their ability to contend with. In the Middle East, the male squadmates often must carry the females' packs on long patrols. Current and former female Marines and soldiers seem to approve of the military's consideration of possibly requiring female infantry to pass the male physical requirements.

Apart from the usual projection of one's own (bad) experience with women, male fans who use this trope contend that a woman just <em>can't</em> be as badass as a man, just <em>can't</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverASelfMadeWoman">achieve anything by herself</a> and that women fighting each other looks too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">titillating and ridiculous</a> to actually be taken seriously.

In the West, the prevalence of more conservative, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">old-fashioned</a> social mores keeps the number of strong females low, although that is changing.

The counterargument from Rei? <em>He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatByModesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatByModesty">shreds her clothes</a></em>, and when she covers herself in shock, he asks why she's doing that if she isn't a woman. Rei was hardly intending on laying a hand on her and the context of the scene has to do with Mamiya worrying about being useless in a fight, and after this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">she becomes genuinely useful in battle itself</a>, rarely needing help except when greatly outnumbered or fighting an opponent who is completely exotic &mdash; and this is a woman without Ken or Rei's ridiculous training and martial arts style.
<ul><li> Interestingly, this was changed when the scene was adapted for the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FistOfTheNorthStarKensRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FistOfTheNorthStarKensRage">Hokuto Musou/Ken's Rage</a></em> video game, adding a scene where Toki assures Mamiya that Rei wasn't being sexist, but wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">keep her safe out of love</a> and narration from Rei that confirms this. What makes this notable is the original writer was in charge of what got included in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a> of the story.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: Casca, being a female knight in Medieval European society, occasionally gets this treatment, especially from Adon, the leader of Tudor's Blue Whale Knights. Every time he and Casca fought, he would berate her for being a woman and threaten to have his men have their way with her (if he didn't take her first). Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">he gets killed by Casca</a>. Guts also gives a speech to this effect to her once. At the time, she was having her period which got her to faint from exhaustion and got both of them to fall off a cliff as he tried to rescue her. Right after, he berates her by saying that a woman has nothing to do in war since it only took her PMS-ing to become incapacitated and that women's weaker and less enduring body was unsuitable for warfare. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyGirl">Casca being who she is</a>, it doesn't work. Their ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">Back-to-Back Badasses</a> moment further proves him wrong and gets him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">view her as a potential lover</a>. However, among the Band of the Hawk, this trope is nowhere to be seen: Casca is the second-in-command of the entire mercenary group, and the men of the Band have nothing but respect for her both as a fighter and as a leader.

Which is true on one hand as she has a naturally gentle disposition and hates hurting even her enemies, but on the other hand, she's very good at defense when properly motivated (the strength of her powers depend on her willpower and state of mind). However, the one time she decided to interfere a fight and saved Ichigo's life, Ichigo told her "Thank you, but never do this again." but it was to have a 1-on-1 fight with Ulquiorra. Future attempts at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taking a level in badass</a> don't really amount to much, as she's immediately sidelined before being able to do anything beyond healing. However, she's taken more steps as being Ichigo's shield from Uryu's arrows and protect him at times, even marching up with him to get to Yhwach. In fact, Ichigo when about to finally fight Yhwach tells Orihime he's counting on her to protect him.

All his in-battle quotes vs female pilots involve referring to them as schoolmarms, nurses, homemakers, or other such female-centric professions. Even against the heavy hitters like Haman, Puru Two, Roux, and Lunamaria, once beaten he derisively dismisses them and will occasionally quote the trope title at them. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> though, he's just a hilariously over-the-top chauvinistic bully.

On some occasions, she tries to accompany the team on missions, but Gateau refuses to allow it every time, even going as far as <em>slapping her</em> to make his point. Nobody comments on this, even though <em>every woman in the manga</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> (with the possible exception of Salad). His attitude would be justified by the fact that she was kidnapped by series' main villain when they were younger, but the reason he kidnapped <em>her</em> and left him to die was <em>because</em> she was the stronger sibling and he wanted her to fight for his cause. Which she later did, willingly. On top of that, he had this attitude long before she ever went missing; a flashback shows him bringing her home after she beat the crap out of a guy who called her weak. He tells her she went too far and that if she doesn't act more feminine, no one will want to marry her. When she says it's too much trouble to depend on someone else and that she wants to be strong to protect her loved ones, he laughs at her.

He refuses to adapt to circumstance and insists that it's the man's job to protect the women from the island's dangers, despite being significantly outnumbered and less strong, competent, and knowledgeable about the island than anyone else. As a result, he's constantly putting his own life in danger and consequently jeopardizing the colony's long-term survival prospects. Amusingly, he constantly gets the shit beaten out of him for this attitude. He can't seem to get over it, though, despite repeatedly being thrown all the way across the island because he took a blow for a girl.

<ul><li> In Zoro's backstory, Kuina, the daughter of the head of the dojo, was vastly superior to Zoro, who was skilled enough to fight adults even back then, and seemed set to inherit the dojo. However, her father wouldn't allow it, saying that women couldn't be as strong as men. Zoro, infuriated by the idea that he'd only surpass Kuina just because she got weaker, made her promise that one of them would become the world's best swordsman. After Kuina died, leaving Zoro to fulfill their promise, Kuina's father regretted his attitude, suggesting in the anime that Kuina might have started to overcome her own limitations.

He quickly lets her do what she wants when he sees how disturbingly determined she is to get Prussia's blood. In the anime, the dub of that episode makes a lot of jokes about Maria Theressa being queen and Prussia's belief that "chicks couldn't lead". There's an interesting inversion in a flashback of when Hungary realizes she's a woman. She comes to the conclusion that she should give up fighting and be content as Austria's maid, while Prussia tries to encourage her to stop wearing dresses and go hunting with him.

Given that he doesn't seem bothered by Yuri's three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">maids</a> helping out with the fighting, apparently that philosophy doesn't necessarily extend to non-nobility.

When Jeanie and her friends come to Ophun in hopes of finding one to add to their travelling party, Ila and Louie explain that female mages in their town don't have the stomach for adventure and prefer to lock themselves away with their studies.

Mega Man is only able to convince her to stop "helping" when she gets their only time machine destroyed. Interestingly, her gender isn't invoked - it's largely her lack of experience and her non-combat design. In a later episode, though, it <em>is</em> invoked when she tries to use powered armor to help out.

Then again, Winry <em>can't</em> fight like Riza, Olivier, Izumi or Lanfan, meaning that she would only be in danger if she decided to help him like she asked many times.

While Machi's boss is impressed with her work, the other man proposes that her work instead be given to a man, since he believes that even if the man isn't as good, he won't end up quitting to get married and have children.

It starts with Littlepip being surprised that there's an Overstallion instead of an Overmare, and Calamity being insulted that she doesn't think stallions should be allowed to be in charge. It quickly becomes apparent that this is the least of the Stable's problems; every position of any real power is explicitly filled by stallions, the few positions that mares are allowed to hold (such as teacher) require them to get help from stallions for basically anything, and the entire Stable is filled with propaganda posters of powerful stallions protecting cowering mares from anything and everything, culminating in a <em>leaky faucet</em>.

Later, when the Royal Guard attack, he tells her to run for the Element of Harmony upstairs while he holds them off... even though <em>she can teleport</em>, meaning there shouldn't have to be any fighting at all. This is just the beginning of a very unpleasant trend.

The other two "spotlight" DA women, Hannah and Susan, are entirely defined by their roles as love interests. That's <em>still</em> better than what happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lavender</span>, whose only purpose in the plot is <em>being raped</em>.

Shifu confesses in his memoirs that he was secretly glad she did that because the thought of Song being captured and carried off by a Mongol in the battle was too horrifying to contemplate. However, he does know how insulted Song would take that notion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Xenophilia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Xenophilia">Xenophilia</a></em>, two instances of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderInvertedTrope">gender-flipped version</a> crop out. One is demonstrated when the human Lero mentions offhandedly that he had a mare ask him why he wasn't following this trope and Rainbow Dash (who he had just started dated), Twilight Sparkle and Applejack are completely <em>livid</em>. Later it's shown that this attitude can be manipulated when a stallion named Chuck Wagon deliberately picks a fight with Lero by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">insulting Twilight and Dash</a>, planning on sitting back and letting one of his mares fight with Dash and Twilight.

Interestingly enough, this also ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, as the women are actually fairly capable when they're allowed to fight (In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Battle With the Witches</a>, Ebony gets three out of four of the keys- killing Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, and converting Hermione- while by contrast, Michael gets his off Ebony's corpse after she's killed by Hogwarts, thwarting his attempt use her to get close to Dumbledore).

Here, it's ongoing as far in as Cold Steel, and feeds Roll's insecurities and wanting to prove herself no matter what.

Though at least some try to justify this that one parent should retire, and the mother is going to be out of action for months anyway so it's more logical for her to retire than the father.

To his credit, he doesn't forbid Terasu to train her fighting abilities, he just thinks she shouldn't have to fight and so decides to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Tsuna</a> to improve his own fighting abilities.

Miriam bint-Alhazred makes a point of confounding the expectations of her Klatchian male peers - and on her return home to Klatch, learns to exploit the chauvanism of her male peers to her advantage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAfrikaner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAfrikaner">Male students from Rimwards Howondaland</a> also tend to have an expectation of women - that they are expected to confine themselves to the kitchen, child-rearing, and Church attendance.

The tales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal">A.A. Pessimal</a> expand on this idea.

He protested, but Carol didn't budge an inch and was backed by her mother, so he was left with no other choice but to accept it.
<div class="indent">And not even Carol, his favorite, could convince him to spend the money on a college education. Her grades were good enough. Her test scores were high enough to have some schools sending her brochures asking them to consider spending four years worth of time and tuition money with them, and even offering some incentives in the way of scholarships. <br>Joe wouldn't have it. Sure, he'd taught Carol to fight. He'd taught all his kids to fight. That didn't mean she wasn't supposed to be a lady, and a lady's place was in the home, not acting like some harlot on a movie screen or in Vogue or being some spinster career girl. She was going to get married, and that was that. No sense in spending tuition money when she could have her pick of men right there in Boston. But, he said, she could go to secretarial school, or learn to be a nurse. Those were useful things. <br>So she went and joined the Air Force.

This mostly died down with the founding of the Village System since the lower death toll meant that constantly replacing dead troops didn't become as high a priority.

Captain Janeway is proud of coming from a long tradition of female space explorers, as the first astronauts were women due to weight restrictions, and even after more powerful atomic rockets were invented married couples were preferred for emotional stability on space voyages that could last years. However social mores are changing as Humanity moves from exploration to colonization requiring women to return to being childbearers, and a UN committee has recommended that only men be accepted to command rank due to their "natural authority".

Mr. Incredible's reason isn't that he thinks his wife can't fight, but that <em>he</em> isn't strong enough... to lose her or the kids again (as he thought they'd been killed earlier in the film). Violet and Helen still fight anyway.

This is taken one step further in his song in the musical ("Me"), in which he sings that women "occasionally" serve a purpose in marriage, specifically "extending the family tree". He's clearly portrayed as a villain because of this.
</li><li> This is the entire driving force behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan">Mulan</a></em>. First, Mulan is considered a complete screw-up because she fails at her session with the matchmaker and thus seems unlikely to be married. Then she is nearly killed for disguising herself as a boy and fighting in the army. She wins the respect of everyone by the film's end (though her female relatives still believe in this trope and care less about the fact that she saved the country than the fact that she incidentally caught the eye of a suitor more to her liking than any of the local boys while doing so) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MulanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MulanII">the sequel</a> has her serving as a warrior for the Emperor again, this time openly as a woman. This is encapsulated in the song "Honor to Us All", which lays out what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">that period</a> thought the proper jobs for women should be, mainly getting a good marriage and being "calm, obedient, and work fast-paced".

Nevermind the fact that she has proven her value to him many times over, including in a fight just a few minutes earlier where she beat up mooks with her martial arts skills and saved Spartan's life by shooting one who was about to kill him. This was later ridiculed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a> in his review of the film, going as far as to put together a compilation of all the things Huxley could have done to help Spartan in the final battle when he's getting pummeled.

In 2007, she had a change of heart and began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">training more seriously in order to prevent</a> Alicia and Becky Bayless from making a mockery of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WSU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WSU">WSU</a> during it's transition to being an all-women company and began using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> appearances to promote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaizeeHaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaizeeHaze">Daizee Haze</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SaraDelRey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SaraDelRey">Sara Del Rey</a> and The Lovely Lacey, who she deemed worthy representatives of the sport (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">which</a> really irked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccuserOfTheBrethren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccuserOfTheBrethren">Lacey</a>).
</li><li> Several female wrestlers throughout the history of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix">Beth Phoenix</a>, have attempted to fight this attitude, which is pervasive in both the company and the fanbase. Chyna had a lot of success with this, winning several matches against male competitors and even having a run with the Intercontinental Championship, as well as defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>, who at the time was playing up a sexist gimmick, in a match that ended up actually being Jarrett's swansong with the WWF. Beth was less successful at breaching the gender barrier, but she did have a couple of memorable runs in the company's annual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> match.
</li><li> Because of this mentality, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> rules from the Brand Extension onwards indicate that any male wrestler who even attempts to attack a female wrestler during a fight is disqualified. Naturally, no such rule exists in reverse, nor does this prevent women and men from being in an altercation where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">the man isn't allowed to fight back, or he's an asshole</a>.
<ul><li> This gets even more creepy in the video games, the later versions of which have gone to extreme lengths to enforce this. The prime example? Not only is the instant-DQ rule in Mixed Tag matches strictly enforced, but they are the <em>only type of match in the game</em> that cannot be set as no-disqualifications. Additionally, certain Create A Storyline scenes are gender-restricted, including <em>any scene that shows violence between a male and a female</em>.
</li><li> The game series is strange in itself because, while barring hitting a female wrestler has always been present, only the most recent three games or so (starting in 2010) have enforced the above instant DQ rule. In the older games, male and female wrestlers could actually fight normally, one-on-one, no restrictions. Yes, you could actually have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly">Kelly Kelly</a> fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> in the 2005 game, but for the second decade of the 2000s, you can't.

<ul><li> In the Sword Worlds most woman do this except for the more eccentric ones. The Sword Worlds are a blatantly patriarchal society though not as extreme as some in this regard. Swordworlders almost worship homes and consider hearthfires sacred symbols. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Housewife">housewife</a> is considered the family priestess among them.

</li><li> Among Aslan is a possible inversion. The women ideally do every job except those which have to do with war, politics, and tending a ranch. This is because Aslan believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">A Real Man Is a Killer</a>.
</li><li> K'kree are both more simplistic in their philosophy of the proper treatment of woman and more extreme than either Sword Worlders or Aslan. The <em>only</em> purpose of females among them is simply to adore the males.
</li><li> Baseline Imperial Culture from which most PCs will come is theoretically indifferent to gender roles both legally and socially. However non-starfaring Imperial citizens from self-governing planets (usually NPCs) will naturally be more inclined to their world's culture then the generic interstellar one and local culture can vary. If appropriate this discrepancy can be demonstrated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Gurps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Gurps">Gurps</a> version by giving a PC "Intolerance (uppity women)" as a disadvantage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> averts this trope. Generally speaking, men and women are equal - if anything, the most powerful people tend to be female; Queen Merela, Brigid, Salina, Lillith, Raksi, the Scarlet Empress, Mnemon, Tepet Ejava... Three of the four most prominent Solars in the first age were women who literally shaped history; the fourth is a man most known for using mind magic to abuse his - physically far more dangerous - wife.
</li><li> Averted (sort of) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. In lore, pretty much none of the significant factions have any compulsions against sending women off to fight alongside the men &mdash; the setting is enough of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack Galaxy</a> that everyone needs all the help they can get and anyone capable of firing a weapon &mdash; including children, in the Imperium's case, and the dead if you have a crystal/robot for them to inhabit &mdash; are fair game for military service. However, in actual gameplay, very few of the armies have actual female models (even ones like the Imperial Guard or Eldar which, canonically, rely on females as much as males) and the one all-female army &mdash; the Sisters of Battle &mdash; are the game's most poorly-supported and lowest-selling army. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a> has stated that the reason for this is because female models don't sell well, although their critics suggest it's because the model lines are not supported well by the company (the aforementioned Sisters being the best example of that).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> most human nations are like this, though there is some leaway (particularly in specialist areas like magic) and (like the medieval/early renaissance Europe they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">they tend to resemble</a>) social class counts more for than gender and noblewomen can be quite powerful. The elven cultures and vampires are fairly equalitarian (as with 40k above this is not really reflected in the models for the elves, though female vampire models are far more common) and the dwarves go in for an "equal but different" approach, with dwarven women very rarely leaving their holds but being very powerful within them. With most of the other factions the question doesn't arise; orcs, goblins and ogres don't seem to <em>have</em> women (their reproduction processes are unclear), skaven females are non-sapient and lizardmen are poorly named as they are in fact genderless life forms created from magical spawning pools.
</li><li> Part of what makes the Theocracy of Jarzon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlueRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlueRose">Blue Rose</a></em> one of the jerkier factions is that it follows a religion with seriously misogynistic traits. Indeed, there's so much emphasis on keeping women barefoot and pregnant, and legally barring them from most of the high-status roles (including all roles in the priesthood save the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">Hospitalers</a>, who are still expected to obey their male superiors without questions), that it borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">No Woman's Land</a>. Jarzon escapes being an obviously evil faction because care is taken to point out that they still do a lot of good in the world, or at least have the potential to do good, and there are reasons why it's such a hotbed of bigotry.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> as the gender barrier is almost non-existent, anyone can be a soldier, commander, or ruler in the Inner Sphere. It's even averted in Clans, as the only rule they have is you have to be a badass, with many females filling roles of warriors and even Khans. Also, even implying this trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">the Magistracy of Canopus</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">a good way to get shot</a>.
<ul><li> Played somewhat straight but deconstructed in the Draconis Combine. Sexism is very prevalent in the Combine, as its the only Inner Sphere state with Agnatic (no women can inherit) succession laws. In addition, the 'ideal' woman is portrayed as being meek and dutiful, and even when they join the Combine military they don't tend to get good positions. However, this is portrayed as being a mistake: two of the best rulers in the Combine's history were women, and Theodore Kurita encourages the creations of new regiments that don't follow the hidebound traditionalism of the traditional Combine military, including treating women as equals. These regiments are the best in the Combine military and part of the reason it survives the Federated Commonwealth's onslaught during the War of 39.

<ul><li> In one of the few examples where the trope is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>, Shakespeare's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></em> involves a man verbally abusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">his rebellious wife</a> to the point that she becomes docile and obedient. Then there's the end when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">she pleads with women in the audience to follow her example</a> and act like reverent homemakers. An otherwise good play, the ending <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">hasn't aged well</a>, and in many modern adaptations gets removed entirely, and there's an oft-cut prologue which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">sets up the rest of the play</a> as the <em>dream</em> of a man married to a shrew, so it might count as a 'fantasy of a henpecked husband'.
<ul><li> Thanks to the lack of stage directions, the play is left open to a good bit of alternate interpretations. Many productions try to soften the blow by having Kate deliver the final speech in a sarcastic way, indicating that it's not to be taken seriously. The Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film has Kate give the speech seriously... but then has her sneak out of the party while Petruchio is taking his bows, humiliating him exactly how he humiliated her at their wedding.
</li><li> It's also worth noting that in the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film, there's a scene (not included in the original play) where Kate is lying awake after Petruchio's first abusive tirade, initially looking fearful...until a look of recognition comes into her eyes, and she laughs to herself.

In the original game series, she was built as a household robot and unlike Rock, never upgraded into a combat robot. In other alternate universes of the game series, she often plays a supportive role in combat, as Mega Man is usually better equipped for most combat scenarios he encounters, but she does tend to accompany him in some way and is never rebuffed for it.

Tifa, who made Cloud promise to protect her if she was ever in trouble and has fixated upon this idea, seems to want to be protected more than Aerith, who makes Cloud her bodyguard but otherwise acts autonomously (at one point even telling Cloud "Don't tell me to go home.")

<ul><li> Around Chapter 10 (Eirika's path), if you rescue Innes the Archer with his Pegasus Knight sister Tana, Innes almost immediately tells her to "stop playing soldier and go home". This is explained later in their supports as being a part of Innes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a>: he thinks Tana is too innocent and inexperienced (and she has just finished her Peg Knight training), therefore he wants to spare her from the horrors of war but handles it so bad that Tana resents him. Innes' attitude is similar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a> Eirika, and slightly towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> L'Arachel, especially in their support conversations &mdash; he refuses to let a woman guard him even when injured or exhausted. Nobody reacts well to this attitude &mdash; Innes is often portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">overly arrogant or narrow-minded</a>.
</li><li> This doesn't come up as much in his supports with the Pegasus Knight Vanessa, whom he often praises for her skill and her maturity. As much, Innes says that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid">Just a Kid</a> when they met, but she's grown up into a great knight and suggests that they are unstoppable as a team. This might have something to do with Vanessa's lifelong status as a Pegasus Knight in his charge - Pegasus Knights are <em>always</em> female (because Pegasi don't trust men enough to fly on them) and are expected to guard his entire family.

Justified in the first game in that Kairi was unarmed, had no combat experience, and no way of defending herself. At worst, the scene was misplaced, as it would have fit better in regards to going to End of the World than Hollow Bastion (where all the other unarmed, lacking in combat experience Princesses of Heart are just fine hanging out at). By the second game, Kairi has a year to become more athletic... plus access to a weapon of her own. Sora also regularly tells armed men to leave the battlefield, a notable (and particularly funny) example being Shang in Land of Dragons.
</li><li> This does get awkward in the Port Royal stage. Though Sora does tell Will to leave early on, it's rather strange that he would tell Elizabeth to do the same later in the stage when she actually played an active role in combat in the portion of the movie the game is covering. He also doesn't brush off Will.

This is one of the rare times the main character's gender is mentioned in the plot (aside from the romance arcs), as the rest of the time, the experience of being a female soldier is never discussed despite female soldiers in the real world still being a minority.
</li><li> The krogan segregate their females and leave them to child-raising, though this is actually a result of their severe population loss requiring them to keep women and children protected to ensure survival of the species. It's suggested in the past that krogan females were not originally restricted in this way (references are repeatedly made to the female warlord <a class="urllink" href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Canrum">Shiagur<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a powerful krogan matriarch whose death caused her male followers to go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>) until after the deployment of the genophage made females capable of viable pregnancies such a rarity. Wrex mentions a strategy at one point which involves using sterile females as disposable decoys in battle to prevent the fertile ones from being found. When the other characters object to this, Wrex hastily adds that it was the <em>females</em> who came up with the plan. The Krogan clan in the fourth game that has largely overcome the genophage averts this trope.
</li><li> The series presents a unique version of this with the salarians. As they are amphibious haplo-diploid egg layers, females are created by fertilizing eggs. Social customs restrict only a fraction of these to be fertilized, creating a race that is roughly 90% male. Females thus hold <em>all</em> political power and rarely leave their homeworld, while males fill all other positions of power in salarian society (such as military and academics). A case where women are relegated to a single role...but that role is the one that determines how <em>everything</em> works. The games also mention that women of the race are highly respected.

The first few times, the girls tell him where to shove it. The results are different &mdash; Selan never needs help, being a mighty general and extremely talented. Tia, however, needs a fair amount of rescuing, but the plot makes sure to note that this is because she's a shopkeeper with no real desire to fight except to keep close to Maxim. When Maxim marries at the end of the first act of the game, Tia returns to her shop as she has no more reason to fight. In the run-up to what everyone believes will be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>, Maxim actually tells the girls <em>why</em> he wants them out of the fight: they're the only ones who can coordinate an urgent evacuation effort.

He outright calls the Qun a lie if you ask him about his unorthodox career choice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> we learn that female Qunari <em>can</em> serve in combat roles, with the major distinction apparently being that while they can have jobs involving fighting, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">are not soldiers or warriors</a>; the Ben-Hassrath, an organization in the Qunari priest caste, are similar to the Templars, though rather than direct might they seem to prefer highly directed force, non-violent or otherwise. This ranges from assassination of or spying on a political enemy, to kidnapping and re-educating important figures or vashoth; those who have left the Qun. Qunari society is divided into three castes. The Antaam handles military and labor, and are always male. The matriarchy handles administration and infrastructure, and are always female. The priests are responsible for education and enforcing the qun, and can be either sex because the wisdom of the Qun speaks to everyone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FeliciaDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FeliciaDay">Tallis</a> is a prime example. She is a female elf sold into slavery and then taken by the Qunari, who converted and trained her as an agent of the Ben-Hassrath. Her role, as reflected in her name/rank ("tallis" means "to solve" in Qunari) is to hunt down escaped Saarebas (Qunari mages, literally "dangerous thing"). Female priests may or may not have roles that require them to fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">but they are not soldiers or warriors</a>.
</li><li> Arl Howe's rant towards a human noble Grey Warden late in the game is extra-dismissive if said heavily armed warrior or rogue who slaughtered her way through his guards is a woman, laughing at her acting like a man. Outside of the Qunari, female soldiers are <em>extremely</em> common, so this is just more of him being a jerk than an accepted attitude, or possibly just trying to piss her off given his many female guards and soldiers.
</li><li> After Morrigan lists the skills she can (reluctantly) provide to the party in battle, Alistair immediately asks her if she can cook. Her irritable response makes it clear that she interpreted the question as this trope, but he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">quickly assures her</a> that he only asked because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">his cooking will kill them</a>, and given the assumption that a Warden of either can't cook either, it's a fair concern.

He explains that a Qunari who desires a role normally associated with the opposite sex, such as a woman who wants to fight, <em>and</em> displays a level of proficiency for that role that is normally expected of the opposite sex, is functionally treated as transgender and become a member of the desired role (note that his own second in command is a female to male transgender warrior). Such people are known as Aqun-Athok. After all, your role in society is more important to the Qun than your gender. He's also implied to be doing some mental gymnastics to justify the female warriors on the team; when they're armed and armored, they're male, when they're not they're female. Cassandra, in particular, is bewildered by this attitude. This also sheds light on Sten's claim that a female warden is not female. All three player characters, if female, display a proficiency for fighting that would have them declared Aqun-Athok. He does make it clear he's oversimplifying to translate a complicated concept that falls outside his field of expertise; the only time he actually uses the term is when he's explaining that trans men like his second who live as men <em>all the time</em> are considered men.

This becomes problematic, as one of the letters has Lee ask Naruto what he thinks of women on the battlefield and the possible responses are that female fighters can hold their own or that women should leave the fighting to men. If you choose the former, Lee will get angry at Naruto and end their correspondence, temporarily locking the player out of the ability to recruit him.

When Ben, Gwen, and Max arrive at a Navajo festival they're attacked by an alien that is first believed to be a Yenaldooshi. When Wes, an old friend of Max's, prepares to go out and track it down, he refuses to allow his granddaughter to join them and says "only Braves (men) are allowed to track." This also extends to Gwen, who obviously objects and has been helping since the beginning, but Max simply replies "Their land, their rules."

Tempest, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">an Amazon</a>, was raised to believe that men are the ones who should do all the housework.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> was well known for this. The famous German phrase "Kinder, K&uuml;che, Kirche" (translated as "children, kitchen, church") is nowadays often attributed to the Nazi Party, but it had actually been in use since the 1890s. The Nazis still saw motherhood as the most important duty for women, and actively discriminated against women who worked outside the home. Mostly they hung on to this attitude even when it had clearly become a bad idea (e.g. they didn't replace enlisted factory workers with women to anywhere near the degree that the Allied countries did, which impacted industry output quite a bit). On the other hand, they did allow women to join the military, in non-combat roles. This caused quite a shock when Germany first fought the Soviet Union, which had women serving in combat roles in every branch of the military. The fact that the Soviets had women driving tanks, women flying combat patrols in fighter planes, and women lugging rifles in the infantry was cited as proof of communist and Slavic degeneracy by the Nazis.
</li><li> After WWII, US women were BOMBARDED with propaganda telling them it was now their "patriotic duty" to stop working in factories and return to the kitchen since the men were coming home. Never mind the fact that women proved not only <a class="urllink" href="https://www.prints.co.nz/mm5/graphics/00000001/9291_We_can_Do_It_Vintage_Poster.jpg">capable of the job<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, but that they sometimes did it even better than the men via more attention to detail, causing one foreman to quip, "Nothing gets by them unless it's right." This helped start a second wave of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Feminism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Feminism">feminists in America</a> who focused on ending gender discrimination, pushing for more economic opportunities for women and more sexual freedom.
</li><li> Even though they both graduated at the top of their law school classes from prestigious schools, the first two women Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O&#146;Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had trouble finding jobs post-graduation because they were both married. O&#146;Connor took a job at a district attorney&#146;s office and then later worked for the Army when her husband was drafted. She took a few years off while her kids were young before finding her way into various offices in Republican politics in the state of Arizona and then to the Supreme Court in 1981. Ginsburg ended up in academia where in her first job she was told she was being paid less because her husband had a good paying job. In the 1970s, she ran the ACLU&#146;s women&#146;s rights project while teaching full time. She was appointed to the federal bench in 1980 and then to the Supreme Court in 1993.
</li><li> This is still largely practiced in sports &mdash; men and women's sports are segregated by sex, with the men's team considered the "real" sport. This can be seen in the case of Mina Johnson, a student of Southampton Academy that is also a JV starting defensive tackle. While the school had no problems letting her play, she chose to sit out a game against a rival academy that threatened to forfeit if they had to play against her. To further extend this trope, the treatment of Johnson led to her team wearing pink socks and armbands as a show of unity for her and trouncing the opposing team 60-0.
</li><li> The majority of detractors of the WNBA are either talking about sleeping with them, insulting their gender (and <em>race</em>) outright, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/6/27/8857175/elena-delle-donne-reads-mean-tweets-people-make-same-dumb-kitchen">or quoting this trope.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> In Brazil, the most common phrase for this attitude is "Go back to the washboard!" (even though with the advent of washing machines, hardly anyone does manual laundry). "Go back to piloting stoves!" is also popular, especially when driving since the stereotype that "All women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">Drive Like Crazy</a>" is still strong there.
</li><li> In Greece conscription is mandatory. For men. Women who want a career in the Army can join a military school (and not waste about a year of their life). This is also the case in Cyprus (which is not part of Greece) and in Russia.
</li><li> Mandatory conscription was the case in Colombia but the rules changed so women can join the Army without a problem, but they're usually out of the battlefield. Some have relatively high ranks.
</li><li> Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn famously told a female colleague: "Woman, go <em>cook</em>". It wasn't meant as a friendly joke.
</li><li> American feminist groups in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> would hand out "barefoot and pregnant" awards to politicians who referenced this trope.
</li><li> Curiously, where actual cooking is involved, only domestic cooking is considered feminine. In professional cooking, women are <em>still</em> expected to stay in the kitchen &mdash;or rather, stay in the <em>other</em> kitchen. <em>This</em> kitchen is a <em>man's</em> world, since allegedly "Only a man can be a chef. A cooking woman is merely a cook." (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaChild">Julia Child</a> blew this aphorism to hell). On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a> America</em>, only two of the ten chefs thus far were women (Cat Cora and Alex Guarnaschelli) and <em>none</em> in the original series. However, there were multiple female challengers in both shows.
</li><li> The Chinese character &#23433; (also used in Japanese) for "safe and secure" represents a woman inside a house. Similarly, the Korean word for one's (own) wife is still <em>anae</em> (the one inside) or <em>jibsaram</em> (house person). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Very similar to the aforementioned Korean term</a> is the British colloquialism "Her Indoors" used for describing one's wife, though it's becoming somewhat antiquated.
</li><li> Many of the conservative sects of mainstream religions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">still advocate this</a>. In some cases, this is due to their belief that family is always more important than a career or money.
</li><li> The conservatives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia">Saudi Arabia</a> believe females should never be allowed outside without being covered from head to toe. <em>Even when they're trying to get out of a building on fire</em>. In 2002, fifteen girls died because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">the religious police</a> locked them inside their burning schoolhouse and barred rescue workers from doing their jobs as they weren't covered. This, by the way, is against the Holy Quran. There's a little something called the Law of Necessity (Quran 2:173) which provides for life-or-death situations, for example, you may eat pork if the other choice is starving to death; by Allah's command, those girls should have been rescued even if they were naked in the shower.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany">East Germany</a> was a thoroughly repressive, Orwellian police state run by Communist overlords. Yet it also had ample opportunities for career-minded women and a robust platform of social services to help them, utterly trouncing the conservative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WestGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WestGermany">West Germany</a> of the 1950s. It's almost like the Communists were deliberately trying to spite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">the former, ultraconservative regime</a>. Post-unification, many people pointed out the new, "liberal" attitudes were a step backwards for the east, particularly obvious when the pre-war 'Kinder, Kirche, K&uuml;che'<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note404j2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note404j2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note404j2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">meaning Children, Church, Kitchen', the "appropriate domains" for women</span> slogan reappeared to discourage women from continuing to work.
</li><li> In life-threatening survival situations (such as fights between colonists and Native Americans), some men have been reported as maintaining this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">even when outnumbered and with the woman being a good shot</a>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, there is a delightful proverb which says that "a woman's place is either in her husband's house or in her grave." Conservative Afghan mullahs are known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">inaccurately appropriating this phrase</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a>. Of course, things were especially bad for women under the Taliban. One of the few good things about the pro-Soviet government of the 1980s was that it was pretty good with women's rights, although the Mujahideen viewed that as just another reason to hate it. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1994, women were forced out of their professions and confined to their homes. They were made to wear shoes that kept their footsteps silent, and windows were required to be painted black so that no one could look inside and see them. They were not allowed outside without a male chaperone and were forced to depend on husbands and male relatives for survival (those that had no such things were forced to beg or prostitute themselves in order to survive). Those men could also have them harmed or killed for even the <em>tiniest</em> infractions. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">No Woman's Land</a> situation especially impacted healthcare: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainDrain">female doctors and nurses were forced out</a>, many relief workers had fled the country, and male doctors either could not or would not treat female patients. So many women were left to suffer and die of treatable (even curable) diseases, and to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">die in childbirth</a> (many women were also suffering from mental problems, such as depression and anxiety, related to their being forced out of professions and public life).
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, male nurses in the U.S. Armed Forces were allowed to carry guns for self-protection, but female nurses were not. In theory, this was because women were not supposed to serve in combat. However, since there were practically no front lines in Vietnam and female nurses were exposed to the same dangers as everyone else in-country, they were exposed to the same danger as men without the same right to protect themselves.
