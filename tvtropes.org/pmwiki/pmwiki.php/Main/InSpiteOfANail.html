</p><p>Or, as it may be, not. Sometimes what's different in the new history is less interesting than what has stayed exactly the same.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Consider how a person's DNA is the result of an ovum and <em>one</em> of countless spermatozoa competing to get at it. The slightest change in timing by seconds would result in a completely different person; different sex, possibly different personality and different abilities, etc. (i.e., half the difference between fraternal twins). This is <em>never</em> addressed. Well, hardly ever.
</p><p>An alternate universe could arise where the human race never developed money and society is radically different, but you'll find that you were still born, still live in the same house, and still have that tattered old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T.</a> doll sitting on the mantlepiece.
</p><p>In an ongoing series, there's generally an element of the production team wanting to get the most out of actors and sets that they've already paid for. In both series and standalone works, the writer may be trying to draw interesting parallels between two different versions of the same character or situation, or to help impress upon the reader how things are different by showing them a familiar figure in slightly different circumstances; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichardNixonTheUsedCarSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichardNixonTheUsedCarSalesman">Richard Nixon the Used Car Salesman</a> allows the reader to see how the world is different, rather than Richard Nixon The Person Who Never Existed Because A Different Spermatozo&ouml;n Fertilized His Mother's Egg.

And even when it is, the writer usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">doesn't bother</a>. The other possible explanation could be that there is some form of higher power (like God, for example) preventing the timeline from changing too drastically. Another still would be the idea of chaos theory and the butterfly effect as being unpredictable in relation to its consequences. As the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
</p><p>Naturally, this could to result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">Close-Enough Timeline</a>.
</p><p>(Note that this doesn't really apply to alternate histories where the change was something the protagonists or their parents did or didn't do. You wouldn't <em>expect</em> universal change within one generation.)

This prevents the idea of "infinite realities from infinite choices" from clogging up the multiverse, by using the "core timeline", the one with the highest chance of survival, as a template for all others. While alternate timelines can be divergent in ways that will not change history on a grand scale (for example, if King Arthur were a woman instead of a man), they cannot be too divergent lest they disobey the Quantum Timelocks (for example, the fall of Camelot cannot be prevented). If a timeline disobeys a Quantum Timelock and becomes too divergent, then its odds of survival plummet and it will very likely become a dead world; said dead timeline is designated a "Lostbelt," and deleted from the multiverse to conserve energy. In other words, the only "nails" allowed to exist are the ones that do not lead the human world to be lost.

Particularly obvious in many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles">Exiles</a></em> storylines; in one the entire world has been under the control of Skrulls for the last century, humans have no access to technology, but apparently Peter Parker was still bitten by a radioactive spider.
<ul><li> It is actually stated, in an issue of <em>Exiles</em>, by the character Morph, in one of the early issues, that he has noticed that a key component missing on a lot of the worlds is the presence of the Norse Gods (Thor, Loki, Odin, etc). He then goes on to say that he thinks that if the Norse Gods were present, many of the worlds would have turned out much more positively.
</li><li> This one is probably best handled in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel1602" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel1602">Marvel 1602</a></em>. In this case, a foreign element (namely, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain America being sent backwards in time</span>) has messed up history; the universe reacts, and "a season has dawned over three hundred years early: a season of heroes and marvels." Or more accurately, "heroes and Marvels."
<ul><li> In a way, <em>1602</em> actually justifies the fact of certain things and people existing in alternate universes, no matter how different &mdash; in essence, <em>1602</em> basically explains that certain people and events were <em>destined</em> to exist, so that altering the past may change some things, but the "important" stuff is still going to happen. Or, to put it another way, the universe itself does its best to ensure that a Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Captain America, etc. exist, no matter what it has to do to make that happen. (If by "the universe", we mean "the Marvel writers and editors.")
</li><li> And <strong>then</strong> <em>Spider-Man 1602</em> has the dinosaurs die out, the accord between the Roanokians and the natives get broken, and the superhumans apparently disappear from history, so that by the time World War II comes round, the only difference between this universe and Earth-616 is that a vial of Peter Parquagh's blood is used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a>. (This <em>may</em> also mean it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElseworldsFinestSupergirlAndBatgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElseworldsFinestSupergirlAndBatgirl">Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a></em> finds Kal-El's rocket instead of the Kents and kills the baby before he grows into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, and later hires a hitman to assassinate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Waynes</a>. The hitman fails and murders the Gordons instead, prompting Barbara Gordon to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a>. Several years later Kara Zor-El's parents send her to Earth because, even though they don't know their nephew's fate, they know about the Earth's heroes. Kara is mentored by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, joins a super-team and makes friends with Barbara, just like in the mainstream universe.
</li><li> In a special story written for the 500th issue of <em>Detective Comics,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is offered the chance to save Bruce Wayne's parents in an alternate universe, knowing that doing so could mean that world never has a Batman to protect Gotham. He does so anyway, and it is later revealed that the deed inspired the alternate Bruce to become Batman as a tribute to the costumed man who saved his parents.
<ul><li> This is echoed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>, where there is still a Batman, but with a twist: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's really <em>Thomas</em> Wayne, who took up the cowl after Bruce was murdered.</span> The Joker, by extension, is also an example: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> what reason other than this trope would cause philanthropist socialite Martha Wayne to respond to her son's death by turning into a psychopathic clown?</span>
<ul><li> Elseworlds stories that have Bruce Wayne becoming a different hero (or a different hero becoming Batman) will generally have the other hero's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> becoming the Joker one way or another. In <em>Speeding Bullets</em> (in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Kal-El</a> is adopted by the Waynes) has this happen to Lex Luthor, while <em>In Darkest Knight</em> (where Bruce Wayne gets Abin Sur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> ring) does it to Sinestro. The latter is especially notable because Bruce prevented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">Red Hood (Jack the comedian) from falling into a vat of chemicals</a> earlier in the story.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>, one of the powers of Samaritan (and his arch-enemy Infidel) is immunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a>. Samaritan was originally sent back in time to prevent the Challenger explosion, and because of his meddling undoes his world's past, he was never born. No matter what happens to the timeline, Samaritan and Infidel will still exist. In fact, Infidel once destroyed all of space-time, and they <em>still</em> existed.
<ul><li> Another <em>Astro City</em> story, "The Nearness of You", averts the trope. A man is haunted by dreams of a woman that he has never met; he knows her well enough to draw her picture, yet utterly fails to track her down. A supernatural character explains to him that the woman is/was his beloved wife, erased in a time-war, and offers to erase his residual memories of her; he declines, and is told that "no one forgets".

Most everybody is miserable and worse off for Duck never existing...except for Gladstone Gander, whose ridiculous luck keeps him the same well-off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> he always was.
<ul><li> Except that he has to care for Huey, Dewey and Louey, who under his inept parenting (mostly consisting of bending on their every whim) have become needy couch potatoes estranged from reality.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrontiumDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrontiumDog">Strontium Dog</a></em>, it is explained that since time is so vast, time travellers usually only exert minor changes which smooth out over time. It takes a truly catastrophic event to alter history noticeably.
<ul><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> storyline espouses the same idea, with Johnny Storm explaining it as "Saving Lincoln just means that everybody will remember how Lincoln was <em>almost</em> assassinated, only to die of a heart attack one day later." Dr. Doom mentions that the "for want of a nail" theory of time travel is a lie spread throughout the timestream by Kang to prevent the emergence of rival time-travelers.
</li></ul></li><li> Bishop of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics is a "chronal anomaly" who has been involved in so much time travel that he himself is never affected by it.
</li><li> An <em>Elseworlds</em> story in the DC Universe, <em>JLA: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNail">The Nail</a></em>, shows what would happen if the Kents had not been out driving their truck as baby Kal-El's ship crash-landed (due to a nail puncturing one of their tires). Instead he was raised by an Amish family and thus never ventured out into the world and never became Superman. Aside from that, not much had changed. All the other heroes still existed, but the public was just more afraid and suspicious of them (cause Superman was a really nice y'know), with debates as to whether they could be trusted. Oh and Jimmy Olsen becomes evil and hatches a plan that involves giving himself Kryptonian superpowers. In the end however, evil Jimmy ends up killing the now-adult Kal-El's Amish parents, giving him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a> to fight and defeat him. Afterwards, he becomes Superman and moves in with the Kents (who had been offering superpowered individuals shelter).
</li><li> In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> story, Supes asked the supercomputer in his fortress to extrapolate what his life might have been like if Krypton had never exploded. The extrapolated story finally ends with an odd circumstance where this alternate Kal-El acquires super-powers, loses his family, and becomes Superman <em>on Krypton</em>, full costume with the cape and insignia and all. Supes and Batman turn away from the screen with just priceless expressions of astonishment.
</li><li> Although Marvel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> typically tends toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a>, it occasionally switches into this trope instead.
<ul><li> In "What if the Fantastic Four had not gained their powers?" (v1 #36), Reed Richards properly checked the radiation shielding on his spaceship, so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> never get their powers. As it turns out, this has absolutely no bearing on their ability to kick Mole Man's ass.
</li><li> An even more dramatic example is v1 #14, "What if Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos had fought World War II in Outer Space?": Thanks to the inventions of Leonardo Da Vinci, mankind has advanced technology including casual spaceflight by the 1940s, but there's still a World War II and it's still got the Howling Commandos fighting in it, complete with all the usual war-comic tropes. Fury's even still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CigarChomper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CigarChomper">Cigar Chomper</a>, though you'd think that wouldn't work so well in a spacesuit.
</li><li> "What If Someone Else Had Become &mdash; the Amazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>" (v1 #7) gives us three parallel universes where a supporting cast member was also present and got bitten by the dying radioactive spider instead of Peter Parker, and subsequently becomes a superhero. As it turns out, in all three cases, their careers are short-lived, but Peter has kept the spider and successfully uses its venom to empower himself, thus becoming Spider-Man after all. The one with Betty Brant as Spider-Girl is the straightest example, with the one character to have died being Ben Parker.
</li><li> A quick study of Marvel's <em>What If...</em> series will confirm that, in the multiverse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, there's only two universes in which Peter Parker doesn't ever become Spider-Man. One of them has no superhumans at all, and the other has no Peter Parker at all. In every other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> variant, Peter Parker exists, and he <em><strong>will</strong></em> become Spider-Man at some point.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em> adds a third, where Gwen Stacy became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Spider-Woman</a>. Here, Peter turned himself into the Lizard... and died.
</li></ul></li><li> A particularly funny example is "What If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>'s Family Hadn't Been Killed?", where Frank Castle's family avoids going to the park on the day of the shooting that killed them in canon. Frank takes a job as a policeman to put his military skills to use, and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop">By-the-Book Cop</a>. His straight-edge nature pisses off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop">the corrupt police force</a>, who try to have him killed... but instead kill his family. The result is that Frank Castle becomes the Punisher anyway, with the only difference being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKiller">he targets corrupt cops and lawmakers as well as criminals</a>.
</li><li> Marvel's youtube <em>TL;DR</em> series notes that even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em>, James Jonah Jameson is, "still same fearmongering blowhard he has always been because apparently that is a multiversal constant."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MajorBummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MajorBummer">Major Bummer</a></em> has an alternate reality where dinosaurs evolved into intelligent lifeforms...and somehow they still managed to create a <a class="urllink" href="http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/comicsalliance.com/files/2011/05/reich01.jpg">Nazi society, complete with understandable German language.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> is a good example &mdash; Marty accidentally prevents his parents from meeting in 1955, so has to get them together in order to protect his existence. Marty's actions change a lot in regards to his family; when he returns to 1985, his father George is a much more confident man and successful author, his mother Lorraine is slimmer and no longer an alcoholic, his siblings are no longer dead-end losers, Biff is now a somewhat goofy car waxer that looks up to George, and Marty now owns a spiffy pick-up truck, one that he had been eyeing longingly in the original timeline. However, the only change beyond his family and Biff is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Twin Pines Mall is called Lone Pine Mall</a>; <em>everything else</em> is exactly the same. Marty and his siblings still exist and were still born on the same days, they still live in the same house, his room is exactly the same as in the "old" timeline, Marty is still dating Jennifer, and was planning the exact same trip to the lake as "before".
</li><li> Then, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em>, you have 1985A. In this timeline, a lot more has changed: Biff becomes insanely wealthy and George gets murdered by Biff. Yet, Marty and his siblings still exist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> still becomes a famous pop star, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFistfulOfDollars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFistfulOfDollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a></em> is still made.
<ul><li> George fathered the three before Biff had him killed; Lorraine even says Marty looks like his father George. Also, Marty's 1985A siblings have apparently reverted to their original Jerkass loser personalities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">Back to the Future Part III</a></em> had Marty embarrass Biff's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest">Wild West</a> ancestor and get him arrested, and Marty and Doc rob a train to drive it off a cliff. This didn't change anything at all, except that now Clayton Ravine is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Eastwood</a> Ravine (named for Marty's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImMrFuturePopCultureReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImMrFuturePopCultureReference">alias</a> instead of the schoolteacher who "originally" died there).
</li><li> They actually discussed this in the commentary for <em>Part II</em> when Biff goes back from 2015, with Marty and the Doc still there. They discussed why it never changed, and decided it'd be better if things remained the same at that moment.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> of <em>Almost Normal</em>, in spite of homosexuals being in the majority (with heterosexuals being the ostracized minority), the culture and society seems to (otherwise) be much of the same. Brad still exists, along with everyone else he knew. It's interesting to note that the homo/hetero flip has led to changes in French history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>: No matter what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> does, the original cast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">TOS</a> ends up on the <em>Enterprise</em> in the spots they filled on the show. It's actually implied that Nero's actions cause the group to coalesce <em>sooner</em> than they did in the original timeline.
<ul><li> In the case of Chekov, it actually caused him to be <em>born</em> sooner. Chekov was originally born in 2245, but the new timestream pushed it forward to 2241. It's interesting to imagine that as soon as they heard the news about the destruction of the <em>Kelvin</em>, Chekov's parents' first reaction was "we should bone!", and that's why Chekov is older in the new film.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note191si');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note191si" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note191si');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's actually because the timeframe in the 2009 movie would've made Chekov 13 years old had his original year of birth remained.</span>
</li><li> This also happened to Kirk who was born two months earlier than he would've been. Nero's attack somehow caused Kirk's mom to go into labor (maybe intense stress or something) causing Kirk to be born in January instead of March like he was in the original timeline. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">novelization of the 2009 movie</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk_(alternate_reality)">reveals<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that Kirk's mom had an inhibitor device to impede the child's birth while she was still on assignment aboard the USS <em>Kelvin</em>. However, as soon as Nero showed up, the impact of the <em>Narada's</em> weapons on the ship caused the device to fail.
</li><li> The only other main difference is that Spock and Uhura's romance is now much more blatant and not one-sided.
</li><li> And, y'know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Vulcan</a>.

</li><li> Though apparently a line they filmed, but cut for some reason, had Spock Prime say that these events happened because this new space-time continuum was "trying to repair itself" to be more like the original, hence the reason why everyone all ended up on the same ship.

The Futurians tells Japan's authorities Japan will become a nuclear wasteland because of Godzilla in the future, and so they must prevent Godzilla's birth in 1954. However, they went after the <em>wrong</em> Godzilla, and went for the one who would be the Heisei Godzilla. However, Godzilla in actuality did not destroy Japan, and judging by the last film, neither will Godzilla Junior, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByHumans">Raised by Humans</a>.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> 4th Edition</em> sourcebook <em>Infinite Worlds</em> calls parallel worlds that are very similar, despite drastic divergence, "high-inertia". Probably the best example is "The United States of Lizardia", which is very similar to Earth, but with different historical figures. Oh yeah, and instead of humans there are six foot tall lizards. This is, however, explicitly noted as a "weird parallel", and there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in the fact that the text description of the worldline mentions that even some scientists who've been studying the USL for years "don't really believe in it".
<ul><li> A multiverse of infinite possibilities would mean a world where history was identical but with lizards (or bears, or triffids) would surely be inevitable.
<ul><li> The infinite multiverse is tempered somewhat by the inability to see or travel to universes beyond a certain number of quantum levels away. They've also only been doing it for about forty years so there would still be lots of surprises around.
</li><li> "Infinite" doesn't automatically imply "all-encompassing". Just like in math you can have infinite sets of numbers that don't actually include <em>all</em> numbers, it's not hard to imagine an infinite multiverse in which not every <em>conceivable</em> alternate universe necessarily has to exist &mdash; and that assumes that it is in fact "infinite" instead of merely "finite, just HUGE" in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> A character can also have Temporal Inertia as a personal trait; it ensures that he will exist in all versions of the present, as long as it's at least marginally plausible. There's also its opposite trait, Unique; a character with that one is likely to be among the first things to disappear if history changes even slightly.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in the setting for the RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em> (and the card game <em>Shadowfist</em>). Despite time travel being involved, any changes you make to the past are likely to result in cosmetic differences in the present, at most. That is to say, killing Hitler's ancestor in 1850 would result in little more than some other short, bombastic dictator causing trouble in Germany. Even massive changes to the timeline (which are only possible by having control over Feng Shui sites) will result in the same people being born, but filling slightly different roles, similar to a different character played by an actor with limited range.
<ul><li> However, by controlling enough Feng Shui sites, a faction can create a major shift in history, effectively rewriting all of history from that point. Before the game started, the world was a magical world controlled by the Four Monarchs, but then the Ascended gained control of many sites and created our current history. In addition, by changing who controlled some of the Feng Shui sites in the 1930s, the Dragons caused the future, originally dominated by the Architects of the Flesh, to be overwritten.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, a late-game sidequest has Lucca travel back in time to the moment her mother was crippled by a large machine. As a child, Lucca could do nothing to stop this accident, and dedicated her life to science to prevent future accidents. If Future!Lucca succeeds in stopping the machine (and thus saving her mother from being crippled), her child self still dedicates her life to science, for almost the same reason. Given that Lucca's Telepod invention is itself responsible for the existence of the Gates (or at least the main factor in their creation) that Lucca then uses to travel through time and save her mother, if saving her mother would result in Lucca not having interest in science it would result in a paradox.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series of games, they describe changing events of the past via time travel as "throwing pebbles in a river." The idea being that history is resilient at self-preservation, and attempting to change it only makes the timeline diverge temporarily, before it quickly rights itself. The catch is that there is only one person/thing capable of throwing a big enough "pebble" to actually change the course of history: a paradox. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So Kain goes about turning Raziel into a walking paradox so that history can be changed.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis</a></em> and its sequel feature historical events and rulers largely unchanged from our timeline, even in the default start. Mostly averted by the third game.
<ul><li> There is, however, an option to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforce</a> this upon the game. If you switch on the "Historical Rulers" option, your nation will have the same monarch names as in real life and the same relative military, diplomatic and administrative capabilities. Of course, given that a lot of nations in an average game will exist outside of when they did historically (or nations may exist that were never formed in reality) you can easily end up stuck with the same inept King for hundreds of years. With this option switched off, rulers will be generated randomly
</li><li> Paradox Grand Strategy games in general see some of this by the nature of the games: technology and society always develops in more or less the same way as OTL (really varying only in speed) and Victoria 2 in particular is built to railroad the game along certain allohistorical paths.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em>, three Ancients manipulated Pious Augustus into becoming their champion, but the parallel realities created by choosing one artifact instead of the two others differ very little from each other: you still end up fighting an undead Roman centurion, while his patron deity still gets his ass kicked and horribly mutilated by the opposite one you summoned earlier. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It then still proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">try and destroy the world and enslave humanity</a>, while your dead grandpa still fixes it for you</span>.
<ul><li> Played straight with Max Roivas: despite finding various autopsies for different monsters in his diaries he still <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">making incoherent rants, slaughtering all of his servants and getting locked inside an asylum for the rest of his days</a>.</span>
</li><li> Subverted by the fact that the first aligned rune you find is dependent on which one you choose at the beginning (on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Rock Paper Scissors</a> system from weakest to strongest against). Since it can help replenish health (VERY useful), sanity (useful if you're very low on it) or mana (worthless as it drains the same amount it replenishes), guess why people tend to leave Xel'lotath's artifact for last...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a> Portable</em> has a female option to see what would happen if the quiet and introverted male protagonist were a bright and optimistic girl instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The answer?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioshockInfinite">Bioshock Infinite</a></em> uses this to provide a meta commentary on the nature of video game storytelling and how the player interacts with it, through the theme of "Constants and Variables." There is always "a man, a lighthouse, and a city," and while there are a few points in the story where you are presented with a binary choice, it has no effect on the ending or the path you take through the story. Certain events are fixed, such as the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Booker never rows to the lighthouse, the coin always comes up heads, and he always picks ball #77 at the Raffle, even after being explicitly told not to.</span> On a meta level, the plasmids and weapons at your disposal, as well as environments that support multiple approaches, mean that the number of ways a given playable encounter can pan out are effectively infinite, just as the title suggests. But the major beats of the story, especially the ending, will always happen exactly the same way no matter what.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em>, the main characters are successfully able to alter the circumstances of Ruka's birth so that she is born as a normal female. However, literally every single other thing about her&mdash;appearance, behavior, relationship to other characters&mdash;is exactly the same. The only real change is a minor event earlier in her life that results in an artifact important to the plot being broken in the new timeline.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</a></em>, only the GDI campaign is considered canon. Yet, no matter which campaign is played, Vega will "borrow" Kane's alien ship, the GDI base in Hammerfest will fall, and Kane will create a mega Tiberium missile. The difference is that in the Nod campaign, Slavik managed to retrieve the ship's contents, Hammerfest remained in Nod hands (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and was used as the staging ground for their missiles to destroy <em>Philadelphia</em></span>), and the mega missile is fired off. But in the GDI campaign, it was McNeil who recovered the ship's contents, Hammerfest was eventually recovered (and Nod attacked it in the first place for the Disruptor sonic crystals rather than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to launch missiles from</span>), and the missile becomes scrap metal. Oh, and Umagon gets captured in both campaigns, although both the causes and aftermath of the captures are different. Slavik's appearance in the expansion, <em>Firestorm</em>, is interesting in that it relies on things that happen in the Nod campaign (escaping his attempted execution at the start, then escaping GDI custody halfway through) that are not once mentioned in the GDI campaign, which leaves it ambiguous whether these are also events that happen no matter what which the GDI campaign is simply skipping over due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">presenting GDI in a more negative light</a> and/or not being as important as dealing with Kane, or if the opening Nod power struggle and Slavik's capture by GDI simply don't happen in the "true" canon.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man (Classic)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> series are a divergence centering on what branch of research was primarily funded and which was cut, either robotics for the former or network A.I. for the latter. Somehow, most of the robots and A.I. in both universes share the same names, abilities, weapons, appearances, and general motifs for no apparent reason, and most of the people involved are on their same respective sides of good and evil. Furthermore, Dr. Wily's <em>Battle Network</em> incarnation is a roboticist just like in the Classic series. Instead of trying to take over the world because of his jealousy towards Dr. Light for being recognized by the scientific community over him, Wily retaliates against society for pushing internet technology over the field of robotics.

</li><li> Speaking of <em>Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire</em>, a small-scale example of this trope comes in the form the Battle Frontier seen in <em>Emerald</em>. This facility, which was a replacement for/expansion of the Battle Tower from <em>Ruby/Sapphire</em>, does not exist in the remakes' timeline, instead having been "replaced" by the Battle Resort. However, the Battle Resort itself is suggested to be the predecessor to the Battle Frontier, as a man at the Battle Maison located within the Resort appears to be recruiting for Scott, the Battle Frontier's owner, and mentions that the position of Pike Queen has been scouted, most likely referring to Lucy, the Frontier Brain of the same title in <em>Emerald</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em> confirms this even further, as it features <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anabel, who is implied to be the very one from <em>Emerald</em> instead of the one in the Mega Evolution timeline; she mentions being from Hoenn and having a tower to guard despite having lost her memories &mdash; but as noted above, the Battle Frontier <em>hasn't yet been built at the time of OR/AS</em>.

Despite this, Frodo and Sam still make it through Mordor, though largely because their players quit (again, because they were sick of the railroading) so the DM turned them into NPCs so he could gloss over the events of their journey.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift">Earth Drift</a>, this happened with the comic's premise: originally, it was supposed to be that the DM was using the game to introduce the players to Tolkien's works, but later on it seems more like the whole story was genuinely created by the DM, suggesting that <em>Lord of the Rings</em> does not exist in that universe. Despite this, all the old fantasy tropes that Tolkien codified are still around in-universe, and the other characters treat them as hopelessly uncreative, so it seems like there was some <em>other</em> iconic work that featured things like elves, dwarves, halflings, and orcs&mdash;or alternatively, all those things were created wholecloth by <em>D&amp;D</em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarpZoneProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarpZoneProject">WarpZone Project</a></em>, things stay pretty much the same after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charles Darwin's children get earased from history to keep only one of his descendants from existing</span>.
</li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChuckNorrisFacts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ChuckNorrisFacts">Chuck Norris Facts</a></em> plays the trope for laughs. Chuck Norris travels back in time and saves JFK. JFK is so surprised and grateful, his head explodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/AlternateHistoryHub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/AlternateHistoryHub">Alternate History Hub</a></em> has a very somber example with <em>What if the 'War on Terror' never happened?</em> The 9/11 attacks never occur and America never invades Afghanistan or Iraq. Instead, the attitude of America as the invincible sole superpower continues on into the early 2000's, as does the rule of stagnant dictators like Saddam Hussein. However, the Great Recession of 2008 still occurs, sending the world into a financial crisis. The Arab Spring still occurs as well, sparking revolutions across the middle east and another civil war in Iraq. The Saudis fund Wahhabist terrorist groups through oil money, refugees start pouring into Europe and America, and drone strikes are used by the west on terrorist bases. The biggest differences are that the World Trade Center still stands, a full military invasion by America never occurs, and there's simply gets an extra decade of peace.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RedPandaAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RedPandaAdventures">Red Panda Adventures</a></em> episode "The World Next Door", a time traveler from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTimeline">Alternate Timeline</a> secures the Red Panda's aid by offering the full case file on an upcoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a> that, in his universe, killed the Red Panda's sidekick the Flying Squirrel. How useful the case file would be was up in the air, as the two universes have vast differences. A trusted friend in one is a supervillain in the other, the Red Pandas' masks are different, and there are at least two confirmed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flips</a> between counterparts. Despite that, when the day comes and the Red Panda Revenge Squad assembles in "A Dish Best Served Cold", the villains' roster is essentially the same as the case file minus those differences and their plan, right down to the death trap used, goes almost identically to the alternate world's version. So much so that the villains are perplexed when the Red Panda names it before they do, notes the death trap they just created had been thwarting him for four years, and rattles off details on its inner workings he could not possibly know. The only difference is <em>who</em> is in the trap, as the hostage is the Red Panda's youngest agent, a teenage boy named Harry Kelly, instead of the Flying Squirrel. Even then, however, the Flying Squirrel was one of the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flips</a>, being a teenage boy in the other world.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>
<ul><li> The "Treehouse of Horror V" segment "Time and Punishment", which begins as a parody of "A Sound of Thunder" and gets progressively weirder &mdash; but no matter what changes Homer makes to history, there's still a Simpsons family, and they're still living in the same house. (Granted, the house is in various permutations of history a McDonalds, a Sphinx with Bart's face, and a giant shoe a la the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NurseryRhyme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NurseryRhyme">Nursery Rhyme</a>, but the Simpsons live there nonetheless.) The story ends with everything normal, except for people having long, forked, prehensile tongues. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">"Eh, close enough."</a> Weirdly, forks as eating utensils still exist and are set out on the table, even though the rest of the family does not seem to need them.
</li><li> For that matter, some of the opening credits' "sofa gags" might constitute close parallel universes of their own.
</li><li> In another Treehouse of Horror segment, Bart acquires the keys of a Time machine and travels back to 1974 (so he can get a comic book cheap). While there, he finds out that if his parents never met, he would be rich. So he splits his parents up and travels back to 2012 (the present when the episode aired). Even though Marge married a rich man, he, Lisa, and Maggie are still born. The mansion they live in is in the same place as his old home as well.
</li><li> One episode had Homer finding out through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">an alternate-timeline showing tomato sauce</a> how his life would have changed, had he won the valedictorian vote in his highschool years. A lot of minor things have changed, like living <em>next</em> to the lot the Simpson house is on (which still has the Simpson home on it, but where his father lives) and working in a different sector of the power plant, and having used protection, so Bart, Lisa, and Maggie have not been born. But he still ends up falling in love with and marrying Marge and still works for Mr Burns.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, in "Masters of All Time", Danny goes back in time to prevent the accident that gave Vlad ecto-acne and his powers... and he succeeds in this, but Jack gets hit with the blast instead, becoming half-ghost in Vlad's place. Apparently <em>somebody</em> had to fill that role. Not only that, but Jack's ghost form has the exact same costume that Vlad's has in the real timeline... with no real explanation as to why this should be. (Then again, it's never really explained why Vlad had that costume, either...)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> has the episode "Road to the Multiverse" where Brian and Stewie travel through different alternate realities including one where the Japanese won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, another where people have two heads and another one where dogs are the dominant sentient species and keep humans as pets. In all of them Quahog and the main characters exist, with the only apparent exception being a world where the last Ice Age didn't end and the town's place is occupied by a glacier. The first world they visit is even stated as one where Christianity never existed, and yet St. Peter's Basilica still exists and is identical to ours... except the Sistine Chapel consists entirely of Jodie Foster's portraits painted by John Hinckley Jr. Also, in EVERY universe Meg is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, and she's still one of the ugly girls including in the universe where everybody is attractive.
<ul><li> In a more heartwarming example, there is the episode "Forget-Me-Not," in which Peter, Brian, Joe, and Quagmire wake up after a car crash, with no memory of themselves or each other. This trope comes into play when it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the entire situation was fabricated by Stewie, who wanted to challenge Brian's claim that he and Peter would be friends regardless of how they met. Turns out Brian was right, as the two end up defending each other in the end of the scenario. Stewie even admits that the two are destined to be friends.</span> D'aww.
<ul><li> Also, the sensation of a cutaway exists despite the fact that none of them have memories to cutaway to.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Life of Brian" had Brian and Stewie alternating history where everyone in the present are Native Americans after they gave them guns before the whites settle and establish Jamestown. Everything is the same, but made up of Native Americans including an alternate Stewie who also built a time machine.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, the crew is sent back in time to Roswell, creating the famous UFO crash landing (it's Bender's mangled body). Though an effort is made to not alter history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> and Fry ends up becoming his own grandfather. At this point, the Professor is just fed up and mounts a full-blown assault on Roswell Army Air Field with the Planet Express ship, stealing a radar dish so they can return home. History is not affected in the slightest.
<div class="indent"><strong>Professor:</strong> Choke on that, causality!
</div><ul><li> On the other hand, if the alternate universes presented by the What-If Machine in the "Anthology of Interest" stories are accepted as true, then Fry becoming his own grandfather is a <em>set</em> point in time that can't be avoided (in the AU where he never goes into the future, his destroying the Cryo-Chamber <em>destroys the universe</em>). In other words, the events of the Roswell episode are quite possible all part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> - the assault and its aftermath might well be events unrecorded by history (especially given its unreliability back in the 1940s-50s, including the lack of advanced technology to record such events as faithfully as in the present). But who can say for certain?
<ul><li> In fact, the episode explains the Roswell Incident by indicating that it was caused by the Planet Express ship crashing to earth. Unless there <em>was</em> no "Roswell Incident" in Fry's initial timeline, this one's stable.
</li><li> In The Why of the Fry, we learn that Nibbler deliberately sent Fry to the future because of this time loop. If Fry stayed in the 21st century, he never would have gone back in time to become his own grandfather, and he never would have had the delta brain waves needed for him to be able to take down the Brain's Infosphere.
</li></ul></li><li> In the film <em>Bender's Big Score</em>, Bender goes back in time hundreds of times and steals all of history's great treasures, including the Mona Lisa, the mask of King Tut, Michelangelo's David, and a mess of other things. This doesn't change anything, because he's using "paradox-free" time travel, which invokes this trope - the universe automatically corrects any problems that would be created, usually by any spare temporal duplicates that can't be made part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> (for instance, if you traveled back in time and stopped yourself from traveling back in time) abruptly dying. Of course, at the end of the movie, he ends up creating <em>hundreds</em> of these temporal duplicates, in a manner that makes half the events of the movie impossible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox">at which the universe gives up and cracks open.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> An odd variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> during the season five finale "The Cutie Remark". Starlight Glimmer, the villain from the season opener "The Cutie Map", reveals a time travel spell developed by Star Swirl the Bearded and refined by her and uses it to go back in time to stop Rainbow Dash from performing her first Sonic Rainboom, which allowed the Mane Six to get their Cutie Marks at the same time. When Twilight and Spike go back to stop her, all of their attempts to use force to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> ends up invoking this trope - Starlight wins and the Sonic Rainboom is stopped. Caught between endlessly trying to stop Starlight or letting her win, Twilight decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dragging Starlight into the next altered timeline and showing her what damage she's caused.</span>
<ul><li> Played straight in that all the characters still have the same cutie marks anyways. Also, each time back to the present, only one villain is shown to be in power, with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> Finn asks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> Prismo to make it so the Lich never existed in the first place. He wakes up in an alternate universe where the Mushroom War never happened, Finn is a farm boy with a prosthetic arm, and Jake is just a normal yellow dog. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The "war" happens anyways, only Jake is turned into the Lich instead thanks to the accidental detonation of the bomb.</span>
</li><li> There's a less extreme example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Yesteryear", in which Spock died at the age of seven because he failed to go back in time to save his own life. Nothing changes on the <em>Enterprise</em> except that the first officer is an Andorian we've never met before. Everyone we know but Spock is still alive, in the same positions, and they are still on the same assignment. A <em>Myriad Universes</em> story explores the alternate universe in more detail and follows the life of said Andorian. There's no major difference in the timelines until the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II</a></em>, at which point divergences begin to happen almost exponentially.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> zigzags this; it takes place in a world where Earth was the site of an alien war back in the Stone Age. The geography has been noticeably altered, ancient relics and battlegrounds can be found in remote places, and it's implied that aliens have interfered in culture in other ways, but broadly speaking, the world of the series is pretty similar to that of ours - there's still a United States, game consoles, smartphones, and so on. It's even implied in one episode that there was a disco fad. On the other hand, it's almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that the world is subtly "off" from ours - there are East Coast states going by the name of Delmarva and Keystone, Korea seems to be unified, several major holidays no longer exist, the center of film culture is in Kansas, the money looks completely different, it's implied that American colonization happened significantly differently, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentWorldDifferentMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentWorldDifferentMovies">Different World, Different Movies</a> runs rampant. On the other other hand, Mike Krol cameoed in one episode. Possibly the most perplexing element is that two of the supporting cast (Kofi and Nanefua) are immigrants from Ghana and recognizable as such, even though the real Ghana's landmass is part of South <em>America</em> in this universe. Whether their Ghana is in South America or a different part of Africa or isn't really touched on.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> had the titular duo sent to an alternate dimension where they are not only criminals, but they and Callie Briggs are working with Dark Kat. Dark Kat's criminal ambitions and Commander Ferral's hatred for the SWAT Kats remain the same (the latter more so than usual).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoveDeathAndRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoveDeathAndRobots">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a></em>: The short "Alternate Histories" is based on a demo of an app that showcases alternate timelines. The ones that result from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdolfHitlarious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdolfHitlarious">rubbery, squeaky-voiced Adolf Hitler</a> dying in 1908 of various causes. In the first scenario, he is beaten to death in a brawl outside his art school - it results in a later World War II that results in an American victory, and Berlin is the city destroyed in a nuclear blast. In the second scenario, he avoids being beaten to death... and gets crushed under a cart instead, resulting in legislation restricting horse and cart, Austria becoming an automotive powerhouse, and Germany winning the Second World War. After that, things get real crazy.
