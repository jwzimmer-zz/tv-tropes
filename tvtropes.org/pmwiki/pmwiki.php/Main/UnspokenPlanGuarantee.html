</p><p>As corollaries, you can ensure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASimplePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASimplePlan">A Simple Plan</a>'s success by making it an unspoken plan, and guarantee failure by telling the audience the full details of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a>. Expect to hear the phrase "I've got a plan" spoken by one of the characters with no further explanation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatWeCanDoCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowWhatWeCanDoCut">before the cut</a> to the next scene. Explaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> after it's been carried out is optional.
</p><p>This, by the way, is why heroes always manage to thwart the villains' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>. The villains always insist on boasting about their evil plan and how exactly they're going to pull it off.
</p><p>Admittedly, the reason for revealing only failed plans to the audience is obvious. There's no drama in something going wrong if no one knows what was <em>supposed</em> to happen. Conversely, where's the drama in seeing exactly what you were just told would happen? The only exception is when the plan is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">Crazy Enough to Work</a>; when every bullet point could go horribly wrong, then each success is a big, suspense-building deal.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">The Law of Conservation of Detail</a> &#151; if a character mentions what they intend to do, rather than just letting us see what they do, it must be because their intention is relevant &#151; which means that their intention and what actually occurs are different.
</p><p>If the characters are keeping the plan a secret in-setting (rather than merely not letting the audience in on it), authors have a number of justifications handy. Perhaps the hero's allies are under enemy surveillance, or the bad guys can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">read minds</a>. Perhaps they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthSerums" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthSerums">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureAlwaysWorks">methods</a> for making people talk. Maybe somebody on your team might be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">enemy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">agent</a>. If so, the only way to keep your opponents in the dark is to lie to the people on your side about what the plan is, or don't tell them any plan at all.
</p><p>A few other justifications include:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><ul><li> The plan includes a deception, and the planner's allies aren't in on it so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWouldHaveToldYouBut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWouldHaveToldYouBut">their reactions to the apparent situation will be convincing</a>.
</li><li> The plan must be enacted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTimeToExplain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTimeToExplain">right now</a></em>.
</li><li> The planner is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllUpToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllUpToYou">cut off from his allies</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">doesn't have any in the first place</a>, so there's no point in explaining unless he likes to talk to himself.
</li><li> The planner is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">making up the plan as he goes along</a>; no sense trying to spell out a plan that's half-formed at best.
</li><li> The planner's allies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptOut">would refuse to help</a> or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatISignedOnFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatISignedOnFor">try to stop him</a> if they knew what he planned to do. Perhaps his plan is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">unethical</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">extreme</a>, or perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreExpendableThanYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreExpendableThanYou">he intends to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifice himself</a> and knows they wouldn't want that.
</li><li> The planner is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">relying on people behaving in a certain way</a>, and letting the subject know that there's a plan at all will make them act differently; the planner, therefore, has to keep quiet.
</li><li> The planner wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsSomethingHesGotToDoHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsSomethingHesGotToDoHimself">keep his allies out of it</a>, and knows they'd insist on helping if they knew what he was doing.
</li></ul><p>This often crops up interestingly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">Tabletop RPGs</a>, where it arises from the players describing their plan in front of the GM &#151; who will, naturally, enjoy the opportunity to botch the plan. The best way to avert this is to enlist the GM's help with the preliminary parts of the plan while keeping the nefarious final steps in the dark &mdash; again fulfilling the trope!
</p><p>Related to the above, there are a few snags that can crop up when this appears in a video game &#151; since the audience is also often one of the executors of the plan, and giving a player a scenario to clear without telling them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">what they're supposed to do to clear it</a> is a fast way to really annoy players.

This rule is sometimes violated as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a>. If you want the plan to succeed the way it's explained, consider the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfoldingPlanMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfoldingPlanMontage">Unfolding Plan Montage</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Million-to-One Chance</a>, where a plan is spoken of, expected by others to fail, yet succeeds.

Angel follows the plan to the letter, but since the rest of the band had previously criticized Yui's poor performance, she gets depressed instead of angry, and doesn't give chase. Otonashi and Angel sneak back to the band's room, and when Yuri storms out again, she sees Angel and gives chase, enabling Angel and Otonashi to execute the second phase of their plan as they'd originally envisioned.
</li><li> Everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> is out to kill Koro-sensei, an unstoppable octopus who will destroy the world if he isn't killed within a year. Expect every assassination attempt on Koro-sensei's life to fail miserably and hilariously if the plan is explained to the reader beforehand. The most successful attempts, which merely injure him or catch him off guard, have always been kept as a surprise to the reader until the last possible moment.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nagisa's second duel with Takaoka</span>. All of the conditions, drawbacks, and psychological aspects behind the "secret killing technique" are explained in meticulous detail right before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nagisa flawlessly pulls it off on Takaoka and wins the fight</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Erwin invokes this by keeping everyone but a handful of trusted individuals in the dark about his real plan to capture the Female Titan because he suspects (rightly) that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an infiltrator would alert the Female Titan to the plan. Subverted in that she manages to break free and escape anyway. Fortunately, the protagonists are still able to identify the Female Titan, thanks to Armin's encounter with her</span>.
<ul><li> Subverted during the Battle of Shinganshina: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Erwin explains his plan for the audience to hear, and it plays out exactly as he describes. The remaining soldiers sacrifice themselves to distract the Beast Titan, allowing Levi to swoop in and tear him apart. Unfortunately, Erwin forgot to account for the Cart Titan, who rushes in to rescue Zeke as Levi is planning his next move</span>.
</li><li> Played straight during the final arc: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After obtaining his future self's memories, Eren never once discussed a single detail of his own hidden agendas to anyone &#151; not Mikasa, not Armin, not Zeke, nor anyone else in the Survey Corps. It all pays off. He pretty much gets everything he'll ever need to end the war against Marley and then some. His plan was to increase tension between Paradis and Marley so much that they would have to launch a surprise attack on Paradis, and using the battle to travel to the Paths, to convince Ymir to end the world outside. And to realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">the readers of the story didn't have any clue what his goal was</a>, until it was far too late</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Koimonogatari</a></em>, Kaiki tells Senjougahara in advance the lie he plans to use to con Sengoku. Sure enough, when he finally pulls the trigger on his plan, Sengoku doesn't believe him for a second.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>. Eda explains an extremely dubious plan for extorting Greenback Jane, involving Jane barely escaping with her life from a hotel room while chased by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivalOfKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivalOfKillers">Carnival of Killers</a>. Revy is just about to drive off in disgust when Jane turns up right on cue. Unfortunately everything after that goes to hell, because if Eda has explained the plan earlier, Revy and Rock could have told her their getaway boat was out of the harbor.
</li><li> Used in varying degrees throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, most notably with the Zero Requiem. Although Lelouch and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suzaku</span> refer to it in nearly every scene from R2 22 onwards, its true nature isn't revealed -or even hinted at- until the climax of the final episode, as it's being executed. Naturally, it works perfectly.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, but only at the end of the least important story arc. The details of the other two arc-concluding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambits</a> are sprung <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">when there's nothing anyone could realistically do about it</a>, and the many Gambits in between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as well as the final one</span> fit this trope to a tee.
</li><li> Inverted and then played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em>, with Yuu's plan on how to defeat team Xros Heart. It's only over the course of the battle that we learn the plan was to counter the tried and true strategy of Taiki leading the front line, Nene providing reinforcements, and Kiriha striking out on his own to flank the enemy. A pity Kiriha had his own unspoken and unmentioned plan consisting of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> swapping their digimon</span>, completely outmaneuvering him and shooting for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">ultimate goal</a> of defeating the opposing general.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Goku intentionally kept his plan to have Gohan kill Cell instead of him since he knew all too well he was far too weak to do it a secret from everyone, including his own son. When the time came to kill Cell in a weakened state, Gohan instead opted to let him suffer since he went a tad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkWithPower">Drunk with Power</a>, regardless of how much Goku begged him, Cell took this time to become a living bomb that would destroy Earth. Goku ended up having to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> because of this, which in and of itself was subverted when Cell by incredible luck ended up regenerating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a> and becoming even more powerful, Gohan was just barely able to permanently kill him. The plan also <em>almost</em> failed before that, because Goku overlooked the fact that Gohan lacks Goku's innate love of combat (something that Piccolo angrily berates Goku about) and thus has a much harder time awakening his full power than Goku or Vegeta would have. Luckily for all the people of Earth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Cell is intrigued by the idea of fighting Gohan at full power</a>, and gleefully pushes him past the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">Rage Breaking Point</a> to awaken it.
</li><li> Happens a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> when the Devil Bats use a trick play. Interestingly, the memorable onside kick against Shinryuji was <em>literally</em> an unspoken plan - Hiruma never spoke the plan to the rest of the team, but they picked up on it anyway. The plan succeeds <em>despite</em> being revealed to the audience directly before its execution.

<ul><li> This is how the manga operates. Heroes come across a bad guy with some crazy, never-before-seen power. The heroes look like they're in a tight spot. Some craziness happens which leaves the villain either dead or begging for mercy. Hero explains their brilliant plan at the end of the chapter arc. And it's all glorious.
</li><li> A double subversion happens in Joseph's fight against Esidisi. Joseph has internal monologue explaining his plan to the audience. While at first it seems Esidisi outsmarted the spoken plan, it ends up working anyway. Then it's revealed that there was a secondary part of the plan that hadn't been explained to the audience ahead of time.

There's just the implication that it'll involve him risking his life.
<ul><li> There's also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fushimi's fake defection</span> in the second season - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he and Munakata</span> made the plan and enacted it, making it a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWouldHaveToldYouBut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWouldHaveToldYouBut">We Would Have Told You, But...</a>" to the audience and the rest of their Clan.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally played mostly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kaiji">Kaiji</a></em>, where we usually only find out the least important half of the plan in advance, such as when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we see Kaiji use balance theory to win a game with scissors but don't know that he expects the opponent to discover balance theory and thus walk into a second trap, or when we see him deliberately mark the cards against Tonegawa but don't know that he wants Tonegawa to realize it's a trap. Played <em>painfully</em> straight in the final game; Kaiji explains his grand scheme to overthrow the chairman in meticulous detail four episodes before the end of the series. No prizes for guessing that it blows up in his face</span>.
<ul><li> Used in both arcs of the second season, too. Kaiji's initial plan is explained in great detail, but inevitably fails. Kaiji figures out the trick to winning, but we only see hints of what he's thinking and have to wait until the plan unfolds to learn about his successful plans. Especially satisfying against The Bog, where there are 3-4 steps to the plan that are revealed as each one comes into play.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LiarGame">Liar Game</a></em>, <em>every</em> spoken plan is either fatally flawed or already used by a rival. And <em>every</em> unspoken plan is either a bluff or the winning masterstroke.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> is a frequent abuser of this trope. No matter how clever the bad guys are, Lupin always one-ups them at the last minute with a new gadget or a brilliant ruse - the audience knows he always has something up his sleeve, but we're almost never told what. The more thought and planning we see go into a caper, the less likely the gang will have any loot by the end.
<ul><li> This trope is subverted at the beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIISevenDaysRhapsody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIISevenDaysRhapsody">Lupin III: Seven Days Rhapsody</a></em>. The special starts with, as with every special, a successful heist (this time, taking the money off the hands of some rich men during a horse race), but it turns out to be a flashforward as part of Lupin explaining the plan to Jigen one week before the heist will take place. The "Seven Days" the two of them are waiting for. Then, at the end of the special, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> takes place, as Lupin gets to the tracks, but the horse race was cancelled due to weather conditions</span>.
</li><li> It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> once: One of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonkeyPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonkeyPunch">Monkey Punch</a>'s only rules for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIDeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIDeadOrAlive">Lupin III: Dead or Alive</a></em> was that Lupin and the gang had to get the treasure in the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> pulls this off perfectly, during the festival arc. Chao's plan to reveal magic to the world is not explained until after Negi and company <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> are forced a week into the future, where it has already succeeded. Upon learning HOW the plan goes, they proceed to go back in time using Cassiopiea. This plan almost fails because it is explained, mostly, before hand, however several parts of the plan are left vague until the end... all of which succeed perfectly. Upon returning to the 3rd day of the festival, Negi and Company attempt to avert the plan. They technically FAIL, which is either a subversion because they knew the plan, or upholding the trope because it wasn't Chao who explained it to them, but Negi defeats Chao in combat, so she changes her wish</span>.
<ul><li> In Chapters 240-248, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">played straight, subverted, and toyed with</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Negi goes into the match with some crazy plan to defeat Rakan that only he knows. Negi reveals one new ability after another, but it's never enough to defeat Rakan. Finally, Negi tricks Rakan into using one of his insanely powerful magical blasts on Negi. It's then revealed that the entire match was planned as a set-up by Negi: during an earlier lightning-fast attack which seemed too weak to defeat Rakan, he had also set up a magic circle that allowed him to absorb Rakan's attack. Negi then uses Rakan's own insane attack against him. This still isn't enough to defeat Rakan, but both of them are exhausted, breaking it down into a mere fistfight that ends in a draw.</span>
</li><li> Played straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">most over the top way possible</a> later on. There's an entire <em>chapter</em> dedicated to explaining exactly how the plan is supposed to proceed, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionDiagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionDiagram">diagrams</a> explaining every little detail. The following chapter sees the entire plan totally ruined by a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episodes</a>. Good thing that most of the exposition was still relevant anyway.
</li><li> Also played straight in that Negi has a plan to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save the Magical World from its seemingly inevitable destruction</span> which he has apparently explained to <em>no one</em>, even the people he should be convincing he can do it.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, where Aeolia Schernberg's unspoken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plan</a> doesn't necessarily succeed or fail, just that it's hijacked and changed halfway through by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Even after the plan is put back on track by the heroes and eventually does succeed, the details of what the original plan was supposed to be are never revealed.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, where ZAFT's strategy is to capture the Earth Alliance's three mass drivers. However, the invasion force thought (by both sides) to be used to capture the third one is instead suddenly given orders to attack the EA's HQ, which was the real plan all along. It seems that the EA is set up for an ambush when its revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a commander who knew about the plan is a double agent and tipped off the EA in time to set up a trap</span>. Muhyo then comes up with an idea, and after getting his attention, the scene cuts to Tomas, then back to Roji, who's incredulous as to whether it will work. Roji then throws out several Wards of Dissipation, which Muhyo's envoys then ride, enabling them to cut Tomas to pieces. The plan works, until Tomas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">reveals his armor's true strength</a>, forcing the heroes to come up with a new plan to defeat their opponent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji">Muhyo and Roji</a></em>, Tomas uses forbidden magical law to give himself armor, and allow him to use a magical vacuum, resulting in him forcing the eponymous duo on the defensive.
</li><li> Can frequently act as a spoiler in battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. If we're hearing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">Inner Monologue</a> of someone thinking up a plan it's pretty guaranteed to fail unless they had some failsafe we didn't hear about.
<ul><li> On a broader strategic level, the discussed plan to capture Sasori's spy (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kabuto</span>) in Orochimaru's men fails when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kabuto attacks Yamato, who is disguised as Sasori, instead of Orochimaru when he comes to interrupt the meeting, a possibility Yamato had not accounted for at any point in the discussions or his internal monologues</span>.
</li><li> There are frequently heroic examples. If, at any time, someone pulls off a gambit towards his enemy, the perspective shifts towards the enemy himself (showing his thoughts about the situation and assumption about enemies plans) or a bystander. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Shikamaru</a> is notorious of this. Having an IQ of 200 he usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">outgambits</a> his opponents.
<ul><li> The fight between him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Temari</a>, a skilled plotter herself, shows her line of thoughts figuring out his technique and how he plans to catch her with it. (Un)fortunately he is still one step ahead of her.
</li><li> During the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Shikamaru is facing off against a kunoichi that is able to control a group of monsters through flute-playing, and Shikamaru can't fight three opponents at once. He takes cover behind a tree and then goes over the inventory of the tools he has in his pouch. That's it. Next he's just throwing things at her...in a way precisely calculated to get her into the optimum position for him to use his final tool, a flash bomb that allows him to use his Shadow Controlling Jutsu to take control of her monsters and control them the way she does.
</li><li> During their first battle against Zabuza, Naruto comes up with a successful paln for him and Sasuke to free their teacher Kakashi from Zabuza's water prison, without even speaking a word. He simply tosses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuumaShuriken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuumaShuriken">Fuuma Shuriken</a> to Sasuke and expects him to know what to do. It turns out that the the shuriken is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Naruto himself</a>, who covertly switched places with one of his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack">Shadow Clones</a>. Despite not remotely being friends and rarely having worked together at this point, Sasuke figured this out because Naruto had transformed into a copy of <em>Sasuke's</em> fuuma shuriken, and he knows that Naruto is terrible at throwing shuriken and thus obviously wouldn't have devoted space in his backpack to carrying one. So Sasuke covertly pulls out his own shuriken and throws them both together. Zabuza catches the real shuriken, notices the second one behind it and jumps to dodge...and then it transforms back into Naruto who throws a kunai from behind. To evade that attack, Zabuza had to remove his hand from the water prison he'd created, allowing Kakashi to escape.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Played straight in both variations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. During the civil war of Arabasta, Zoro comes up with a plan to tell each other apart, just in case the one guy that can copy people's bodies tries to interfere. They all wrap bandages around their left arm. When the time comes, the body-copier also has the bandages on his left arm. The kicker? Beneath the bandages was an X on their arms, which we were not told.
</li><li> Chapter 41 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pluto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pluto">Pluto</a></em> has Professor Roosevelt about to go into his plan on a surefire way to kill Gesicht, but the chapter ends before he can do so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The plan works and Gesicht dies.</span>

Emma and Ray's plan to set the house on fire in order to distract from their escape works perfectly.

</li><li> Played with in the second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators">Re:CREATORS</a></em>, where the heroes invoke the trope in their backup plan to defeat the Military Uniform Princess <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09743');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note09743" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09743');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Namely, fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OCStandIn">O.C.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki">Saki</a></em> managed to subvert this while maintaining the suspense: At times, <em>multiple</em> characters' secret plans would be revealed to the audience, but the plans would directly conflict each other, some being plans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">out-gambit</a> an opponent. (For example, Koromo trying to use her luck manipulation abilities to win with <em>haitei raoyue</em>, while the others catch on and try to call tiles to affect the turn order in a way that would make it impossible for Koromo to do so.) So several fully-described plans (such as Hisa's bad-wait strategy) would work perfectly, as the suspense came not from whether or not a single plan would work, but rather from the question of <em>which</em> gambit in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> was going to win out.

Then again, the threat they dealt with was a diversion (which the reader already knew about, as part of Pai's discussed plan to pollute Tokyo Bay, which fails). Most other combination attacks are discussed before being executed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouBougetsushou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouBougetsushou">Touhou Bougetsushou</a></em> has a double subversion.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WeddingPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WeddingPeach">Wedding Peach</a></em>: Played with in the first piano episode. First Parodied: Yuri's plan consists of invoking the ghost of a friend's dead sister with piano music so she will encourage the friend to resume practicing piano. Both Momoko and Hinagiku think this plan is ridiculous. Played straight in that their real plan, have Momoko pretend to be said dead sister, is interrupted by a devil attack, but ultimately subverted as the plan never actually goes into motion because the real ghost <em>actually shows up</em>, just as in the original conception.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> not only does this straight, but makes it extremely obvious where many duels go where the face down cards of hero and villain alike often go unknown until they are used much like a spectator would see. Almost every time this trope is employed the flow is broken where the character would not only completely explain his plan in a drawn out monologue, but often visualize what <em>could</em> have happened. This even occasionally goes for <em>face-up</em> cards, when their abilities go unmentioned until the point where they become relevant, even though in the real card game it's important to know all the abilities of your opponent's cards. In general, if a character starts internally monologuing about how they're going to win next turn, expect that they won't <em>get</em> a next turn.

However, a lot of minor things go wrong.

</li><li> Inversion: Holmes' internal monologue specifically and graphically describes exactly what he's about to do to whatever poor schlub he's fighting and why it'll work, and then does it, and it works.

The Rebel Alliance has a nice elaborate plan involving the operation on both the moon of Endor and in space to sabotage the shields around and destroy the second Death Star respectively. Unfortunately the Emperor had anticipated this. He had a massive legion on Endor and a major fleet to defend the Death Star, not to mention the fact that the Death Star itself was operational. In the end the Empire loses due to several unplannable things. The Ewoks never planed to intervene, Chewie never planned on stealing an AT-ST, Han never planned to use it to open the bunker, Lando never planned to use desperate tactics for the Rebel fleet to survive the Death Star, and most importantly Vader never planned to betray the Emperor (at least, not in that particular way).
<ul><li> Also, Luke never gives any specifics about his plan to rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt, but despite Han's worries, succeeds after all.

Naturally, this ends up being what tips the inevitable conflict with Nicodemus in Harry's favor. This is actually justified in-universe, as Nicodemus' fallen angel Anduriel is capable of spying anywhere a shadow is cast, unless a sufficiently powerful being like Mab is there to block him. Harry knew Anduriel would be watching him like a hawk during the heist, so he couldn't tell his allies anything without tipping Nicodemus off to his plans.

Most of the time it's due to scene cuts or chapter breaks, but there's at least one instance where it happens in-universe as well. Faced with an enemy with some degree of mind-reading powers, Tavi uses a fiendishly complex series of nested written orders, including multiple orders for each contingency imaginable. If people don't know the plan they're following, the mind-reader can't find it out. Tavi muses later that the best part of the plan is he doesn't have to explain anything to anyone.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Black Company</a></em> uses this frequently. In the early books, Croaker is often in the dark about the Captain's, Lieutenant's and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darling's</span> plans, meaning the reader is too, and they very rarely go wrong. In later books <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Croaker is Captain</span>, there is a change of viewpoint character to avoid his plans being exposed. The plan leading up to the battle of Charandaprash is kept in the dark for several years in the book, and kept secret from the readers for about 2 books of build up. Needless to say, it succeeds.

The reader is told exactly how this plan will work. Just before they do it, though, Moist realises this would cause more problems than it solves, and comes up with a plan to destroy the company but leave the system in place.

The Tleilaxu, Qizarate, Fremen naysayers, Bene Gesserit, and Spacing Guild hatch (a) plan(s) to remove the Atreides from power that seems to revolve around a clone of dead Atreides retainer Duncan Idaho. It turns out that the plan was much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">more complicated</a> and the clone only played a minor role, but for all the plotting it only ends up making Paul blind and by the end of the book all the conspirators are dead save for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">High-Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a> had a habit of averting this. In all his books, he had a strong formula regarding plans that went as follows: the protagonists would find out about the villain's plan, usually due to coincidental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactEavesdropping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactEavesdropping">Exact Eavesdropping</a>. They would concoct their own counter-plan, with each party member contributing something and everyone smugly congratulating everyone else on their collective brilliance. When the time came, the plan would usually go off without a hitch. What Eddings was drawing on here, instead of the reader's suspense about the success of the plan, was the anticipation of the complete chagrin and despair the villain would suffer when they were foiled. And to keep things interesting, much of the time the heroic plan would be defeated by some small detail that no one was aware of, or succeed but prove to have been ineffective at pursuing the protagonists' ultimate goals.

</li><li> <em>Star Surgeon</em>, "Resident Physician": When Conway deduces what is wrong with Lonvellin, who is suspected of murdering and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eating</a> his personal physician after an argument over the latter's treatment, Conway doesn't explain to his colleagues why he has called for a wooden stake and is very slowly pushing it against the patient's skin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The personal physician was actually a symbiotic organism who was isolated and removed from Lonvellin while trying to defend its "employer" from the stake by concentrating itself into a hard bony plate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SectorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SectorGeneral">Sector General</a>'s staff resolved the quarrel between the patient and the symbiote by giving the latter more information on the physiology of the former.</span>

Protagonist Car'das, a guest/captive of Thrawn, escapes and sets into motion an unspoken plan that enlists the aid of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">Planet Looter</a> villains. It appears to go pear-shaped, until we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Car'das' plan was actually part of Thrawn's plan, which we didn't even know existed.

</li><li> <em>Star By Star</em> is another example of this. Anakin and the other Jedis' plan to infiltrate the Yuuzhan Vong headquarters goes horribly, tragically wrong. Justified in that is was a suicide mission from the get go and everything worked to get them to the worldship.

</li><li> Explicitly justified in the last novel <em>Mercy Kill</em>: The characters admit that their officer, "Face" Loran, tells each "Wraith" only the information he or she strictly needs, for security reasons - and maybe because Loran enjoys monitoring the utterly confused Wraiths.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Unwind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Unwind">Unwind</a></em>, Risa is being chased by Connor who is also being chased by an officer.

<div class="indent"><strong>Coulson:</strong> We only get one shot at this, so let's go over the plan one more time so we're clear on exactly what we're doing, OK? Trip will crest the ridge, use the noisemaker to grab a three-wheel, maybe something with more fireworks, and open a window for you two.

</li><li> Used a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AliasSmithAndJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AliasSmithAndJones">Alias Smith and Jones</a></em>. If Heyes verbalises his plan, it is guaranteed to fail, to the point where people wonder how on Earth he managed to get his reputation as the most successful outlaw in the West. Unspoken plans, especially those which he doesn't even tell the Kid about, are guaranteed to succeed.

<ul><li> In the first episode of Season 2, Sheridan's debut, he doesn't bother to explain his order to hold fire until afterwards, starting with a "Just as I suspected ..." At least a pilot is later seen complaining about this.
</li><li> Sheridan does it again later on, when he orders his staff to do several strange things, such as sending a White Star to destroy some completely normal asteroids, and asking Ivanova to report on the news that that absolutely nothing happened in a specific area of space. In fact, his plan (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenghisGambit">Genghis Gambit</a> to get the other governments to unite in the face of a completely fictitious enemy</span>) absolutely hinges on him not telling anyone what it is!
</li><li> Londo Mollari demonstrates great mastery of this trope, when he devises a plan to lure his nemesis G'Kar into a trap and lays it out to his aid Vir. Londo's rival Lord Refa captures Vir, wrings the plan's details out of him and hijacks the plan to capture G'Kar himself and humiliate Londo.

Played straight in several episodes, but the two-parter "Resurrection Ship" averts this spectacularly. Both the plan to destroy the Resurrection Ship, and the plans of Cain and Adama to assassinate the other, are set out beforehand. The action then jumps right into the middle of the attack, witnessed from a detached POV (Lee drifting in space after ejecting from his craft) as the suspense is provided by us wondering whose assassination plan will succeed. And then, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cain and Adama both decide to call off each other's assassinations at the last moment, with both of them realizing exactly what almost happened.

Once the party starts, they spend several minutes coming to the realization that the whole thing actually has no chance of working, and are totally flummoxed when they realize it worked <em>exactly</em> as planned.

Norman needed the dagger to complete a spell to release the uber demon Asteroth into the world. However, unknown to the audience, Vicki and Henry had first taken the dagger to a priest to have it blessed before they gave it to Norman, so that when he used it, his spell of summoning failed and he was sucked back down to Hell.

Holt does catch on and finds Jake just before he heads out, but by that point Jake already had everything ready and only stopped because Holt talks him out of it.

<ul><li> The Season Three finale demonstrates this perfectly. Two enemies make plans; one of the plans is fully detailed to the audience, while the other one is kept vague. The vague one, of course, is the one that succeeds. This one is particularly noteworthy, since the planning processes are <em>superimposed</em> over one another. Buffy will be just about to go into the details of her plan, and it then switches to Wilkins giving instructions to his vampires, then back to Buffy making vague allusions, and so on.
</li><li> And in Season 5, where they talked in vague terms about what they might have in the way of weapons, but never go into detail about all the parts of their plan. Meanwhile, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> has been getting pretty specific. And so...

You always know what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is going to try to do, but it's not until almost the very end, when the action is well under way, that you find out Buffy is having Willow use the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">scythe to activate all the potential Slayers</span> into full ones.
</li><li> In Season 7 we also have a literal unspoken plan, made via telepathy.

The kidnapper announces that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his father</span> has 10 seconds to come out as well, or he'll shoot both Castle and Alexis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His father</span> responds, that's not going to happen, because the kidnapper will be dead. The kidnapper looks confused, and then the real bomb, which had actually been planted exactly according to plan, explodes and kills him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His father</span> was actually just waiting for the kidnapper to stand in the right spot. As for Castle, he grabs Alexis the second the real bomb goes off and makes a beeline for the US embassy.

Any Con", Coach is bilked out of a large amount of money by a con man. Recurring character Harry The Hat, himself a con man, devises a plan involving most of the Cheers regulars to get Coach's money back. The plan seems to fail miserably because Coach's bumbling reveals the scheme, but later they learn the ruined plot was actually a ruse to cover the real con, known only to Harry and Coach, which was successful.

We do see her telling the Doctor, but since she's stuck on the other side of some soundproofed glass at the time we see her communicate the plan through mime. It's just difficult enough to understand that when we see the Doctor and Jo perform parts of it, it feels less like a spoiler and more like, "oh, that's what that hand gesture meant".

</li><li> Justified in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E5Oxygen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E5Oxygen">"Oxygen"</a>, as the Doctor refuses to reveal his plan because he might be overheard (which happened earlier). "I try never to tell the enemy my secret plan." As per this trope, it works perfectly.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E10TheEatersOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E10TheEatersOfLight">"The Eaters of Light"</a>, wherein Bill points out the Doctor never tells her his whole plan.

This plan is not explained until after it's kicked off, so it goes perfectly.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted somewhat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, like in "Ariel". The whole plan was described in minute detail, complete with scenes of the characters rehearsing their parts, and except for the temporary arrest, both the heist and River's diagnosis are completed as planned. Same with "The Train Job", except for the Captain and Zoe getting trapped. And the opening scene of the Big Damn Movie, except for the Reavers. However, "Trash" and "Objects in Space" are perfect examples of unspoken plans going perfectly (almost). Also, this line from the movie pretty much sums it up:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mal:</strong> I don't plan on any shooting taking place. <br><strong>Jayne:</strong> Yeah, well, what you plan and what takes place ain't ever exactly been similar.
</div><ul><li> The aversion in "Ariel" is very much the exception that proves the rule. The plan was described in minute detail and worked (almost) exactly as planned, with all possible external threats perfectly anticipated. The suspense came from <em>internal</em> threats (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jayne betraying the Tams</span>), and suspense aside, it was funny or at least fun to see how the ragtag crew of "Serenity" handled a plan organized to the last detail.

This is, of course, what anyone who gets lucky in pool will tell his friends even if it's blatantly obvious that it isn't.
</li><li> A subversion of the trope occurs in "Legion". With the crew being held captive by the titular character, Lister comes up with a "truly award-winning escape plan" from the movie <em>Revenge of the Surfboarding Killer Bikini Vampire Girls</em>, but doesn't go into details on screen. When Legion shows up, he immediately sees right through the plan (involving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lister hiding behind the door ready to hit him with a heavy piece of artwork, while an obvious decoy of him made from other artwork sits in his place</span>), namedrops the movie where it came from, allows it to happen and watches as it fails miserably.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in "It's Good to Be the King". Maybourne translates a prophecy (really, a historical record written by a time-travelling Ancient) that says heroes will arrive and destroy invaders. SG-1 instead plans to evacuate the planet's inhabitants and destroy the Ancient's Puddle Jumper so the Goa'uld won't get it, but the Goa'uld arrive early and trap them on-planet. They're forced to fulfill the prophecy <em>with</em> the Puddle Jumper to get out of the mess.
</li><li> The Ori actually pull one of these on the good guys in "Beachhead". Because the Ori Prior refuses to tell them the plan, they end up playing right into the Ori's hands.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used repeatedly in "The Siege", which sets up several plans then dashes our hopes just to drive home how unrelenting a threat the Wraith are. The Ancient defense satellite takes out one hive ship and burns out, the nuclear mines the SGC hoped to use to defend the planet are knocked out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a>, the <em>Daedalus</em> only manages to take out a few hives before they devise a defense...
</li><li> "The Return" in uses this trope masterfully. The audience is misinformed about the protagonists' plan of liberating Atlantis. When all seems lost and the plan (as the audience knows it at that time) has been countered, their true plan immediately works out and only then is explained. Specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rodney tells O'Neill and Woolsey that they plan on blowing up the city's shield generators with C4 strapped to the control crystals then escaping the city, but gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap">Dope Slap</a> from Sheppard for leaking the plan. When the Asurans extract the plan from their minds and counter the sabotage, turns out the <em>actual</em> plan was rigging the shield generators with an Anti-Replicator Gun crystal, which the Asurans failed to notice due to being distracted by the C4. Sheppard expected that the captives will be interrogated, hence he had Rodney "leak" the fake plan on purpose as a distraction</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in the seventh-season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Badda-bing Badda-bang", in which the plan is detailed to the audience throughout the fourth act, not only with explanations but being <em>acted out on-screen</em>; of course, this is only so that the audience knows what's <em>supposed</em> to be going on in the <em>fifth</em> act, when everything goes wrong.
<ul><li> The entire plot of the sixth series episode "In the Pale Moonlight" rests on this trope. The episode unfolds as Sisko tells the "computer" (i.e., the audience) what happened when he tried to engage in underhand and even quite illegal methods to bring the Romulans into the war on the Federation's side. As it unfolds it seems like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> gone horribly wrong that brought the Romulans into the war on the Dominion's side. Actually, it turns out Garak pulled this trope on Sisko (who then pulls it on the audience) by hiding his real plan from Sisko from the outset. What Sisko thought of as their plan going horribly wrong actually goes (from Sisko's point-of-view) horribly right. Justified in that Garak knew all along just what it would take to bring the Romulans into the war on the Federation's side and he also knew Sisko would never have had the stomach to go through with it had he known from the start what it would take. When Sisko realises the truth, he also ends up accepting Garak was right all along... and is deeply troubled by the fact he <em>can</em> accept it.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> episode "Dark Frontier" involves a raid on a Borg cube, which we see the characters rehearse on the holodeck first. They actually fail, but not by much, and something very different goes wrong when they try it for real.
</li><li> On the other hand, the second-season <em>Voyager</em> episode "Resolutions" averts this trope. Tuvok goes into painstaking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">on-screen</a> detail about his plan to beat the Vidiians and get the medicine <em>Voyager</em> needs. It then goes off without the slightest hitch.
</li><li> The episode "Basics, Part I" has the staff discussing a battle plan against the Kazon, which actually works for a while&mdash;until a Kazon suicide bomber screws everything up.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> cliffhanger "Unimatrix Zero" involves an unspoken plan which several characters think is nuts, and indeed, it seems to go spectacularly wrong. But then Chakotay says "So far, so good", letting us know the plan isn't actually over yet. We get to see the rest in part two.
</li></ul></li><li> An example of the telepathic enemy example can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> episode "Return to Tomorrow".

</li><li> In "The Defector", Picard calls Worf to his ready room, but their meeting is not shown. Later, he sends Worf off the bridge to deal with a message from a Klingon ship. These are the only hints shown that Picard has called in the Klingons for backup, since there are no other Federation ships close enough to help. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">The sight of three Birds-of-Prey decloaking is enough to get Tomalak to back down</a>.

The plan fails thanks to some spectacularly bad timing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">poor communication</a>, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">both Romeo and Juliet dying</a>.
</li><li> One of the main differences between Shakespeare's tragedies and his comedies is that the tragedies are more likely to play this trope straight, whereas the comedies are more likely to avert it. For example, the second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a></em> centers on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">another false death gambit, also hatched and explained in detail by a friar, but in this case the gambit actually succeeds</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThrillMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThrillMe">Thrill Me</a></em>, Richard suggests two plans in "The Plan". One is killing his brother John, which Nathan talks him out of. One is killing some random kid, which he is absolutely certain they will get away with, since there's no motive. It doesn't work out. Additionally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nathan</span> puts together another plan which is not revealed until the end, and goes off without a hitch<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, landing them in prison&mdash;together for the rest of their lives</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/UtopiaLimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/UtopiaLimited">Utopia Limited</a></em>, an operetta by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wisemen plot to overthrow the king's company,</span> but do all their plotting by whisper, concluding, "At last a capital plan we've got/ We won't say how and we won't say what:/ It's safe in my noddle &#151;/ Now off we will toddle,/ And slyly develop this capital plot!"

<ul><li> This trope happens <em>all the freakin' time</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> games. Often his assistant or even Phoenix himself will mention that they've finally figured out the case, give some vague clue as to what conclusion they've reached, yet it's still up to the player to figure it out. Largely justified, since combining evidence to solve cases is basically the entirety of the gameplay, so having the whole thing spelled out for you at the last minute would kind of defeat the purpose.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> franchise; the main characters often undergo a series of investigations including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactEavesdropping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactEavesdropping">eavesdropping</a>, pick pocketing important items, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">interrogating people</a> close to the target. Then they announce a plan they've used those details to come up with in broad strokes, allowing the player to determine the actual plan of attack. Although some targets spring surprises that simply can't be avoided and force the character into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploy</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Brotherhood</em> onward introduced full synchronization bonuses for completing certain objectives like not being seen or killing a certain amount of people. So while the plan can fail in gameplay and result in you having to chase the enemy, canonically your player character really did kill the guy while staying unseen, or slaughtering hundreds of guards single-handedly.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em>, where all the prisoners in Vorkuta are familiar with Reznov's plan for everyone to riot and escape:
<div class="indent"><strong>Reznov / Prisoners</strong>: "Step One! <em>Secure the keys!</em> Step Two! <em>Ascend from darkness!</em> Step Three! <em>Rain Fire!</em> Step Four! <em>Unleash the Horde!</em> Step Five! <em>Skewer the winged beast!</em> Step Six! <em>Wield a Fist of Iron!</em>...Ah-hahaha! You know what to do! Step Seven! <em>Raise Hell!</em>"
</div><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a> when Reznov and Mason break into a garage and reveal the <em>eighth</em> step of their plan: Freedom.</span>
</li><li> Mostly played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em> - Soap never goes into detail what his "Plan B" is in the mission "Cliffhanger", and as such it works as intended. Of course, the player probably realized what exactly it entailed by virtue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">placing C4 onto something very flammable as part of the set-up for it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Tohsaka refuses to elaborate on her plan to defeat Caster in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>. Shirou assumes it's because it's some sort of plan that won't work as well if he knows about it. While this may be true, the real reason is obviously so that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tohsaka can surprise us with her hand to hand combat skills and utterly floor Caster</span>. The plan actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">works</span> because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caster didn't know Magi had picked up martial arts skills, but it's not enough to win. It was only enough to distract her until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue">Archer</a> showed up</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> features a long and involved plan to capture Deling. One part of the plan goes <em>better than expected</em> (the heat sensors the guards were supposed to use didn't work)... and the plan still fails because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deling was swapped with a body double ahead of time</span>. Then came the planned assassination of Edea, explained once again in great detail, which (despite almost failing for umpteen other reasons) almost makes it through, only to fail at the last minute because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edea blocks the bullet Irvine fires, and in the direct attack, she defeats Squall</span>. But then, later in the game, a much more convoluted plan averts the trope (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Odine's plan to have Ellone trick Ultimecia into a partial time compression actually works and helps the heroes reach and defeat Ultimecia.</span>)
</li><li> Played almost perfectly straight in the "Poacher's Day" storyline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>. The unspoken parts of Carren's plan, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having Lunalu draw a giant lifelike picture of the Urkin Queen to distract the Odajumoki ships, or Tweyen and Izmir firing ice-imbued arrows from over the horizon to stop the leader from dropping their giant crab's remains and setting the queen off to lay her eggs early</span>, goes almost completely without a hitch. Afterwards comes actually removing the shell from the Urkin Queen, which was described in great detail, so naturally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Duskbringer gets stuck in the Urkin Queen's shell. Fortunately, Seofon's sword duplication saves the day</span>.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> when Cortana sends a vague message to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">UNSC</a> telling them of a solution for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">the Flood</a> at the Ark. As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ark contains a foundry at its core that can build <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon">Halo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">rings</a>, with it having already almost finished building a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperweaponSurprise">replacement</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Installation 04</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">John-117</a> activates it to eradicate the galaxy-threatening Flood as well as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Gravemind</a></span>. Justified since the knowledge could have fallen into the hands of the Gravemind had anyone known the details due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">the Flood's ability to assimilate the knowledge of its victims</a>, which would have led it to not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">send all its Flood forces to the Ark</a> in an effort to avoid being killed by the activation of the other Halo rings. In fact, Cortana herself wasn't quite sure what was at the Ark, making this less of a plan and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">everyone hanging onto something Cortana had vague knowledge of that they didn't even know existed</a>. It also helps that each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunner</a> installation's Monitor had important details of other installations removed from its mind as a precaution; otherwise the Flood would have had enough information to guess the plan.
</li><li> In one route of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryStickminSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryStickminSeries">Henry Stickmin Series</a>: Completing The Mission</em>, Henry, Ellie, and Charles only have a few seconds to stop the Toppat Clan's rocket from reaching orbit. Charles's plan to ram his helicopter into the rocket confuses Ellie as to how that would help. By the time she concedes, the rocket has already left. Ellie's plan to overload the engine room and jump out the forward left booster is foiled when Charles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourOtherLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourOtherLeft">waits by his left instead of hers</a>. Henry's plan is not explained to the audience and is the only one that succeeds.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KiraKira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KiraKira">Kira-Kira</a></em> at d2b's first concert, before which Shika and Murakami have some kind of secret plan they talk about but never clarify until it actually happens onscreen. There's at least one example of the trope going the other way too, where a concert is expected by all characters to go fine but winds up going horribly wrong when Kirari falls victim to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> onstage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>: Anything involving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">Joker's interrogation</a> isn't made clear until it actually happens. In particular, the Phantom Thieves discussing the plan is fast-forwarded and blurred, along with all dialogue being muted, so the audience can't hear what the Thieves are talking about. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is because Joker was heavily drugged by the corrupt police force, and legitimately did not remember that there was a plan until the last minute. Still, the plan goes off without a hitch, exposing the identity of the traitor as Goro Akechi, letting the Phantom Thieves get some clue as to who's heading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConspiracy">The Conspiracy</a>, and getting Joker safely out of police custody, all at once.</span>
</li><li> This trope shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>. The plan Shegor's talking pet turtle comes up with that goes off without a hitch and very nearly solves everything is blanked out when discussed, then carried out in a cutscene.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon">Robopon</a></em> game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Dr. Zero exploits this trope. He doesn't tell you a thing about his plan until it's already enacted, ensuring you have no way of finding or stopping him beforehand.
</li><li> Mostly averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper">Sly Cooper</a></em> series, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Bentley</a> describes in detail what must be done in each mission, and the mission usually goes just as planned. Not all of them, mind you, but exceptions are the exception rather than the rule. After all, it's considerably more fun to <em>play</em> through something you've heard about than to just <em>watch</em> it. There is a straight example of this trope, though, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves">Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves</a></em>. In the final mission against Pirate Captain LaFwee, Bentley's plan appears to fail due to LaFwee's counter-planning, but it turns out to be much more elaborate than the plan described to the player.
</li><li> Used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/SonicAdventure2">superbly</a> by Eggman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>. Eggman hints that he has some sort of plan made, and proceeds to go through his last level. When he arrives he almost kills Sonic, exposing the Fake Chaos Emerald and obtaining the real one. On Sonic's side of things, he states his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> out loud, where it proceeds to blow up in his face spectacularly. This scene is practically scrapped in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>.
<ul><li> Averted earlier in the game. About midway through the dark story, Eggman explains to Shadow and Rouge his plan to steal the Chaos Emeralds from the military and destroy their command base at Prison Island. The plan hits a few snags due to Rouge slipping up and the arrival of Amy and Tails, but ultimately succeeds, gets the villains three more chaos emeralds, and effectively cripples GUN's ability to interfere with them further.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em> novelization, the Tarka commander uses an unspoken plan to win against a race of telepaths: She gives her Human and Hiver allies a straight-forward battleplan and has a conspirator in the fleet (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicStatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicStatic">who the telepaths can't mind-read</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">'betray' them</a>. She then backstabs the telepaths while they're gloating over their victory, with their captives being unable to give them any useful information because they have no idea.
</li><li> An interesting twist is presented in the fifteenth installment of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouProject">Touhou Project</a></em> series, <em>Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom</em>. The fourth boss, Sagume Kishin, is a Lunarian Goddess with the ability of reversing a situation with her words. This means whatever she'll say or any plan she'll speak of will have fate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">invariably twist itself over its head</a> and turn what she's said into a lie every time, so she has to carefully choose her words should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">she not want an undesired result from her ability.</a> This effectively makes her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummateLiar">Consummate Liar</a>, but not by vice, just because her words eventually end up <em>becoming</em> lies with time. After a Moon invasion caused by Junko, Hecatia Lapislazuli and their army of fairies supercharged with life force which turned them into the embodiment of impurity (a concept Lunarians flee like flies towards lavender) had the Lunarians relocate themselves elsewhere (first in the Dream World, which ended up not working as planned due to being cornered by Hecatia anyways), their sights were set on the Earth and they decided to invade and purify it in order to make it an actual safe location for them to live. However, this was just a safety plan for Sagume, because as soon as she encounters the heroine in the Lunar Capital and tests her skills, she realizes there's no use to purifying the Earth anymore and wholeheartedly spills all the beans to the heroine, effectively making her ability come into fruition. She essentially took a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> as she betted on the reason for her plan to fail being the heroine going to defeat Junko and Hecatia, thus freeing the Moon from its rampant impurity. It can thus be concluded Sagume is <em>the reason why you win the game in the first place</em>.

However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">WQ</span>'s plan, the most mysterious of the three by far, is quite firmly dashed by outside circumstances. To clarify:
<ul><li> Rose's plan was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to fly Derse's moon and the Tumor to the Green Sun using her dreamself, using the Tumor to destroy it. Instead, both she and Dave died and transferred to their dreamselves. Then DD attacks a defenseless Rose while she's trying to fly away unnoticed. Finally, both she and Dave get the Tumor to the place it's supposed to be, only to discover that the Tumor isn't what destroys the Green Sun, it's what created it in the first place. It's not all bad, though; Rose and Dave got God Tiers out of it, and the Green Sun is now powering two of the heroes as well</span>.
</li><li> Jade's plan was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to escape through the fourth wall at the last moment, to ensure that the Scratch goes off without a hitch. Not only does this succeed, but she ascends to God Tier due to an unforeseen attack and manages to take their planets through the Fourth Wall too</span>.
</li><li> WQ's plan was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to use the transportalizer in WV's station to escape to the troll's session, then blow up the stations once they arrived so that nobody could follow their trail. It would have worked, if only Jack hadn't been hiding in the frog temple the entire time, and was released a mere ten seconds after the White King arrived..</span>.

<ul><li> Not that this webcomic needs in-universe explanations other than "it is a narrative trope", but still this is justified in that Lien knows Elan is dumb as a brick and can't bluff so telling him WOULD be a sure way to ruin the plan.

</div></li><li> Nale and Zz'dtri's plan to murder <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Malack</span> remains unspoken until they actually pull it off.

</li><li> Lampshaded again later on, when Team Tarquin specifically avoids talking about their plans onscreen. The plan mostly works and only fails at the end due to Tarquin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>.

Dream plans where and what he will do in a specific situation for one of his videos. Then he tells no one until he actually executes his plan. Meanwhile the Hunters are multiple different human beings, and must coordinate plans between them in real time.

We're given a step-by-step breakdown of the team's plan for infiltrating an assembly of villains complete with accompanying imagined footage of them enacting the plan. Numbah 4 expresses his doubts about the plan... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">and then says how it worked perfectly.</a> The double subversion comes when Numbah 1, who was missing during the plan, was actually captured by said assembly, forcing the team to rush in to save him.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cybersix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cybersix">Cybersix</a></em> episode "Gone With the Wings". Cybersix tells Data 7 and Julian (and by extension the audience) her plan is to lure the goblin creatures onto a subway train and propel them out into the daylight, which will kill them. It goes off without a hitch.
</li><li> Danny announces such a plan in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> episode. Though Danny didn't suspect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJailer">Walker</a> to use the Fenton Thermos against him, he didn't suspect Danny's plan, so it all works out in the end.

Timmy comes up with an Unspoken Plan that appears to fail miserably... but it then turns out it wasn't actually finished, and once it is, it <em>does</em> work perfectly.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, Lois asks Peter to stop the toad licking problem. Peter announces he has a plan, then we cut to Peter saying "And that's my plan," in the principal's office of the local high school. The principal's response is, "What plan? You just came in here, sat down, and said, 'And that's my plan.'" We get a similar cut, and the principal now knows the plan. The problem is soon stopped.
</li><li> Played for laughs and almost-but-not-quite inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em>. In an episode, Freakazoid and his pals are hiding from a villain. He then says not to worry, for he has a plan. He proceeds to make his location known to the villain by openly mocking him and daring him to come get them. When Freakazoid's friends ask for the rest of the plan... turns out he forgot.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>: Played straight with any plans made by David Xanatos. If he's involved in an episode and has not revealed a plan, then the episode ends with him saying everything went the way he planned it. If his plans are known from the start, then more often than not, they don't work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em> episode "Black and White" uses this trope excessively. The team's mission to infiltrate Providence is made up of plans within plans, and each little piece is explained, as it is being executed, by multiple short flashbacks to their meeting in the Situation Room beforehand.
</li><li> Used straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>'s first episode, "The Beginning". After summarizing the gifts from her late father, Jerrica states, "I know how to stop Eric Raymond." We don't get the plan&mdash;until we learn who Jem is!
</li><li> Subverted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KappaMikey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KappaMikey">Kappa Mikey</a></em>, where part two of the plan turns out to be...

They failed. Shego yawned and rolled her eyes as the guys schemed away, not revealing her own plans (until she finally succumbed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">Evil Gloating</a>), and sure enough she became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">The Supreme One</a>.

When Shego presses him for an explanation, he reveals that he kept her in the dark to test whether the plan was clever enough &mdash; if Shego didn't figure it out, neither would Kim.

Partway into the plan it is reveal that they have disguised Fluttershy as "Impossibly Rich" to trick Gladmane into confessing that he has manipulated his employees, but Gladmane sees through the plan. It turns out that this was part of the real plan all along and while Gladmane is bragging, he doesn't realize he has been tricked into confessing, which the viewer doesn't find out was part of the plan all along until after it happens.
</li><li> Played straight in "Sparkle's Seven", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the initial plan Twilight makes to become Sibling Supreme and steal the toy crown is explained in detail and completely predicted by Shining Armor. The gang make a new plan to be unexpected, but it ends up backfiring too. They eventually try the original plan and it almost works, only to be caught during the final stage. It is then revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkHorseVictory">Spike</a> managed to successfully steal the crown, due to secretly getting help from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">Princess Luna</a> behind the scenes, which both the viewers and characters were unaware of until the big reveal</span>.
</li><li> Also played straight in "The Summer Sun Setback". Early in the episode, Chrysalis comes up with a plan and whispers it to her allies as the camera fades out. The audience only knows that they plan to use Twilight's friends to set up a distraction so as to break into the archives, but not the details. The plan works.

<ul><li> Any episode where the plan to capture the monster is spoken out loud will be ruined, usually by Scooby and Shaggy's incompetence, though it will invariably succeed in a different way because of this.
</li><li> Doubly Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo">The Movie</a>, along with most other Scooby-Doo cliches, by having the spoken plan... actually <em>work</em> after it almost fails.

Mystery Incorporated</a></em> Fred's traps <em>may or may not</em> work, in the intended way or otherwise, and may fail even if he hadn't explained exactly how they would work.
</li><li> Another double subversion in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo">What's New, Scooby-Doo?</a></em>, where Fred's trap on the vampire monster <em>worked</em> within the first few minutes of the episode. Daphne and Velma are surprised by this, but it turns out the case wasn't over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because while he was kept in captivity, his twin kept the mystery going by being the vampire in his place</span>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Burns:</strong> We're getting screwed. There must be something we can do about this... Wait!

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in the episode "The Succubus". Kenny tells the other boys his plan to get rid of the succubus in detail on screen, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">Kenny</a>, so the audience doesn't understand a word he says.
</li><li> And the classic episode "Scott Tenorman Must Die", where Cartman is constantly trying to get revenge on the episode's namesake. He tells Stan and Kyle (and thus the audience) a fairly ridiculous plan to get a pony to bite Scott's penis off; this plan already seems likely to fail. Furthermore, Stan and Kyle warn Scott of this plan just to spite Cartman. It turns out Cartman was expecting Stan and Kyle to undermine him, and this was actually part of a larger, unspoken plan by Cartman that does work spectacularly.
</li><li> When the boys need to retrieve an important list from the girls, Cartman' first plan is thoroughly laid out: "ambush the girl with the list in the passway and kick her in the balls", but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">fails</a>. Of the second plan we only hear the first part ("Kenny spits on the floor"), and the plan succeeds off-screen.

Obi-Wan and Anakin are leading the siege of a city when Anakin discovers a secret way inside past the shields. In a deadpan voice, Obi-Wan says, "So your plan is to sneak in through the sewers, under the shield and into the main generator, destroy the generator and have our troops swarm in?" They then do exactly that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>, on the other hand, plays it straight <em>very</em> frequently:

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks">Storm Hawks</a></em>. One episode has a character narrate a plan beforehand over what looks to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> of the plan actually playing out. The narration continues even when everything starts going wrong, and the spot is shown to really be a flash-forward.
</li><li> Mad Mod takes over and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">absorbs Robin's youth</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> episode "Revolution". The remaining Titans each have their own strategy on how to save the day, which all fail. Starfire then says that they need to combine their ideas into one plan. The unexplained one works at first, but it seems Mad Mod is going to win again as he catches Cyborg, Raven, and Starfire. When Mod asks where Beast Boy is, Starfire explains he was the plan, leading to victory.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> the first time the Autobots fought Starscream: After a short <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> speech, Sari quips in by saying "Okay, here's my plan...".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted &mdash; Robin is so used to this when working with Batman that he forgets that the rest of the team are not familiar with this, which leads to a lot of problems.
