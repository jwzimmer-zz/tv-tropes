</div></div><p>A character is born with or acquires some handicap that prevents them from functioning normally. However, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHeroOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHeroOrigin">phlebotinum exposure</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">training</a>, never mind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityImmunity">Disability Immunity</a>, they develop something that not only makes up for what's missing, but goes beyond it.
</p><p>Blindness seems to be a popular one for this. Indeed, the entire trope seems to be based around the idea that blind people's other senses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">become more acute</a> to compensate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">This does happen</a> in real life but to a far weaker degree than the trope, simply because blind people get more exercise with paying close attention to their other senses, and the brain is capable of re-purposing unused spaces in the sensory and motor cortices. Some studies have indicated that people born deaf have better peripheral vision, as well. In Greek mythology Tiresias is an old blind man, but also an oracle, so he can see different things.

A character muses on the possibility that only being able to listen his "interior voice" is what gives Kojiro his remarkable ability in swordsmanship.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Vagabond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Vagabond">Vagabond</a></em>'s Sasaki Kojirou is <em>very</em> different from the basis for the manga (Eiji Yoshikawa's <em>Musashi</em>) in that he's deaf, with multiple character interactions and fights riding on this. Two separate characters even theorize that his swordsmanship has improved <em>because</em> of his deafness: one hypothesizing that his eyesight improved to compensate, while another thought that without sound to distract him he could better listen to his own body which already knew the techniques. Subverted by Kanemaki Jisai, who tried to dissuade him from a life of swordsmanship by repeatedly taking advantage of Kojirou's deafness to defeat him multiple times over the years.

</li><li> Al. Being a giant, hollow suit of armor probably allowed him to survive some of the things he's been through, no matter how much he wants his body back. Losing their arm/leg/organs/entire body is the reason why Ed, Izumi and eventually Al are able to transmute without a circle.
<ul><li> Later, another major character, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Roy Mustang, is forced through the Gate (he doesn't commit human transmutation</span> and can then transmute without a circle, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becomes blind and seemingly downgraded into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a>.

<ul><li> This is even lampshaded by Winry who states that she doesn't want Ed to get his limbs back because she notices just how useful the automail is to Ed (and by extension her, since she's his mechanic).

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">catch</a> to having this power is that due to his lack of skill and a frail body, whatever body part he uses this power with is broken instantly, requiring Recovery Girl's repairing (but also stamina draining) kiss to heal him. Because Recovery Girl&#146;s power simply speeds up the healing process and not grants regeneration, Midoriya's continued use of his quirk through his hands would eventually make him lose all function in his hands. To compensate, he uses his feet when using his quirk (having learned more control over his powers).
</li><li> Denki Kaminari's quirk "Electrification" allows him to generate and conduct electricity. Over exceeding his wattage limit on the other hand short circuits his brain, leaving him brainless for an hour.

However, the way the Reuse "P" Device works requires the pilot to be this way. That "P"?

In another issue, while pursuing the Mole Man into Subterrania, he moves through what he perceives to be an empty tunnel. The first panel shows his surroundings through the eyes of his radar sense.

He was born deaf, but his rich family had a scientist (Dr. Will Magnus, the same guy who made the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MetalMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MetalMen">Metal Men</a>) implant a cybernetic hearing aid in his head. It worked a little <em>too</em> well, as his hearing became so sensitive that he was able to design sonic weapons that could control the minds and actions of others, but won't affect him.
<ul><li> This was later explained as him being able to somehow channel the Anti-Life Equation thorough his pipe, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis">given where this came from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> must always wear a special visor or pair of glasses to contain his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eyebeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eyebeams">optic blasts</a>. When these devices are removed, he keeps his eyes shut, rendering him blind. Due to an important instance of this, he has since learned how to fight blind by using his hearing to pinpoint opponents and simply always scrutinizing his surroundings to know the lay of the land. One side story shows that he also counts his steps and memorizes which way he turns so that he can retrace his path and find his eyewear.
<ul><li> Even with the visor/glasses, he's still colorblind, only able to see in shades of red. It's possible he shouldn't be able to pilot an aircraft such as the Blackbird, but there are custom control panels that have indicators based on number of lights, rather than color. Presumably, the Blackbird has one of them.
</li><li> Bonus points for the reason he can't control his optic blasts: at a young age he was in an accident and suffered severe head trauma, but fortunately there wasn't any damage to any "important" parts of the brain. This was <em>before</em> he developed the ability to obliterate everything in sight... Sadly, this actually plausible explanation (a rare sight in comic books) has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">re-explained</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retgone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retgone">outright removed</a> several times, with many writers defaulting to "he just can't control it because that's how it is."
</li></ul></li><li> His abilities don't come from being unable to see, but it's worth mentioning Rot Lop Fan, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> from a species that never evolved sight at all (and thus no conception of color or light... or lanterns, for that matter). His Green Lantern Oath goes:
<div class="indent">In loudest din or hush profound
</div><div class="indent">My ears catch evil's slightest sound
</div><div class="indent">Let those who toll out evil's knell
</div><div class="indent">Beware my power, the F-Sharp Bell!

He could hear people's heartbeats through walls, but even a light breeze on his exposed skin could cause him incredible pain. At one point, his powers were even used against him: a villain (who knew about his powers) tortured him simply by making a shallow cut on his skin with a Swiss army knife. The pain from this relatively minor wound almost caused him to black out.
<ul><li> He once had a fight with Iron Man wherein they both lost their armor. The battle then became a test to see whose disability was worse, Iron Man's weak heart or Mr. Sensitive's hypersensitivity. Mr. Sensitive won, but just barely.
</li></ul></li><li> During the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamStrange">Adam Strange</a> lost his eyes in a freak teleportation accident. However, he quickly compensated by connecting his ship's sensor array to his visual cortex, allowing him sight as long as he was piloting.

This doesn't come up often, but occasionally it protects him against the subtler sonic attacks as a plot point. (Perhaps less plausibly, once he's also shown unmasking an android as such by, apparently, turning his hearing aid all the way up and <em>hearing</em> the imposter's internal mechanisms.)
<ul><li> The reason it doesn't turn up any more is because his hearing was restored after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesReborn">Heroes Reborn</a>.

Any wizard can be instantly and permanently stripped of his powers by someone invoking his True Name. As a result, one of the requirements of a wizard rising to significant power is a willingness to ruthlessly destroy anyone who knows his True Name, including friends and family (lest they be tortured into revealing it to a rival). The only powerful wizard in the series who isn't an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceror">Evil Sorceror</a> was born under unusual circumstances and was never given a real name, only a temporary nickname that stuck far longer than intended.

(She was... not in a good mental place.) However, she discovers that the implant that allows her to talk to machines <em>also</em> allows her to perceive electromagnetic waves, giving her the ability to "see" not just frequencies of visible light, but a massive array of other types of radiation as well, meaning she can see through walls just fine. Oh, and she can also see emotions. Somehow.

As a result she is blind but she can get into other peoples' minds to see through her eyes. In addition, she can see their feelings and emotions and sometimes she can even influence them.

People with these conditions have the same automatic reactions as a sighted or hearing person, so if they didn't think about what they were doing, they could play pinball. Still pretty impressive, though.

<ul><li> In the fourth edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, the "blind" keyword actually has nothing but benefits. Blind creatures are immune to gaze attacks, and every blind creature in the game has "blindsight," which works exactly like sight except that it's black and white, functions in total darkness, and has a somewhat more limited range.
<ul><li> Blinding a player character still confers drawbacks, but even a character who's been blinded <em>and</em> deafened can still pinpoint enemies with Perception checks if their skill is high enough. I guess they smell them.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a> where players build characters on a point system that assigns negative point values for physical disadvantages (effectively freeing up extra points to buy additional abilities) invite the use (and abuse) of this trope.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>, for instance. The "Blindness" disadvantage (just as an example), while giving characters a distinct penalty to combat skills, makes it less than that suffered by people who have been suddenly blinded (thus, a person with Blindness has an advantage over a sighted person when the lights go out). No specific bonus to other senses is given. It is, however, stressed that vision-based abilities are <em>not available</em> to someone with this disability (yes, some people <em>do</em> need to be told).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a>: Supers notes that you can give Blindness and Microscopic Vision to a hero who can <em>only</em> see tiny nearby things, playing this straighter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> notes the trend and devotes a paragraph to explaining that, for example, if a character takes Blindness as a flaw and Tremorsense as a super-ability, they shouldn't get any points for the Blindness flaw since it's covered, only possibly a Hero Point for a Complication should their Tremorsense get removed or nullified. Common sense, really...
<ul><li> A concept introduced in <em>Champions: The Super Roleplaying Game</em> (aka the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem">Hero System</a>) two decades before M &amp; M came into existence. The rules for Disadvantages note that you can't get any points for a disadvantage that is directly negated by a special ability (gamemaster judgment calls may be required &mdash; for instance, sonar vision doesn't truly "negate" blindness because you can't read, see colors, etc.).
</li><li> M&amp;M actually makes it a minor flaw, rather than no flaw. You still get a bonus for it, but it's only one character point - which affords, approximately, jack shit. This is because with blindness and tremorsense you can't legally drive, for example. Deafness and telepathy will let you have communications, but if you're attacked by a robot in a dark room you're hosed. That kind of thing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BigEyesSmallMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BigEyesSmallMouth">Big Eyes, Small Mouth</a></em>'s Defect system is ripe for the abuse of this trope; all of the "impairment" defects are Major ones, and can give back enough points to buy up abilities that render the impairments moot in addition to game-breakingly powerful secondary attributes. That does assume that you're okay with playing a flying, psychic paraplegic.
</li></ul></li><li> The Oracle class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> includes this in its game mechanics. All oracles are cursed in some mildly disabling way, but gain extra abilities related to the area of their curse - for instance, oracles with clouded vision lose the ability to see more than sixty feet away, but gain the ability to see in the dark and sense invisible creatures.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, Pariahs are emotionless and soulless, which means they never find love or happiness, but they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">immune to magic and demonic possession</a>.
<ul><li> Not immune to magic as so much as they suppress around them. Though they are immune to demonic possession because they have no souls. They also have the disability of being attractive targets for conversion into a kind of elite necron fighter or an elite Imperial assassin.
</li><li> The tau also have similar if less extreme characteristics. Which has lead to some interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a>.
</li><li> Orks also are highly resistant to demonic possession, partly because they have unbreakable will power, and partly because of how stupid they are. Most demons who try to possess them find themselves stuck in an idiot mind, resulting in Orks that talk to themselves a lot.
</li></ul></li><li> In Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG, the equip spell Flint is an annoying equip spell that weakens the host monster and prevents it from attacking. However, the monster Flint Lock is designed to be immune completely to the negative effects of Flint, and even benefits from extra powers while equipped with Flint, such as being indestructible by battle. Cherry on top, it can even manipulate Flint to contaminate other monsters, or relieve a monster from it to use its protection.

He does very well at his first tournament, breezing through his first few matches, struggles in his next few, but ultimately managing to win and become champion even when apparently outmatched. When he asks how he managed to win with only one move, the master knowingly tells him that the move he mastered, which happens to be one of the most difficult throws in Judo, has only one known defense against it: grab your opponent by the left arm.

There are limits to his abilities. His henchmen manipulate some of his pastimes (like golf) so that he wins. When they are not around, he is not always infallible, such as in this exchange during the 'You've Had Your Chips' mission: he's playing blackjack with CJ. Going for a five-card hand...

<ul><li> One of the early missions you have with him involves helping him wipe out a rival gang in an alley, which starts off with him feeling around for a loose cobble as a landmark to get to the right alley, and then he runs face first into a wall. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">And then he whips out a machine gun, loudly declaring that their blood will flow like wine.</a> Depending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">on how the AI is doing that day</a>, there's a more than decent chance he's not going to need CJ's help for that section.

<ul><li> One troglodyte warlock, Geon, is blind but has the ability to 'see' magic and read the minds of enemy spellcasters. In game-mechanics terms, this gives him a bonus to his Eagle Eye skill, making it easier for him to learn new spells.

Their skill, 'Demon of the Sun, Moon, and Stars' (or 'Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Shadow'), grants its owner a + 30% bonus to Attack Speed - this bonus is insanely large. In exchange? <em>The character's sight</em>. This isn't like the 'Blind' status effect, where a character takes a hit to their accuracy - accuracy is just fine. However the player's screen becomes black the moment this skill is learned, with a lighted area surrounding their character. As the skill is levelled up, and the attack speed bonus moves closer to + 30%, the lighted area shrinks, until at level 10 and + 30% ASPD, the tiles immediately surrounding a character can <em>just be made out</em>. These effects are permanent and utterly irrevocable.

The difficulty of using his weapon of choice is also shown in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> gameplay. His attacks are difficult to pick up, but when mastered he is the second strongest character, being able to chain devastating (and stylish) combos, and is one of the few characters capable of healing.

This left her with the ability to read and manipulate people's subconscious, a much more powerful ability that places her as the extra stage boss, compared to her stage 4 boss sister.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> 3</em>, Demon Hunters blind themselves to better see demons. They have their eyes burnt out, then the eye sockets are used to contain the essence of a demon, which gives them more power and abilities, such as the ability to better see magic in their surroundings, which includes demons. The demon's essence they seal in their eye sockets look like color tinted flames, so they often wear blindfolds over their eyes to keep from creeping out those around them.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, the members of the ritualist profession blind themselves to better sense spirits. (Hence their hats) One character (Aeson) even was born blind, and became a ritualist for partially this reason. This is either making themselves blind, or wearing a hat that covers their eyes so they can be deprived of senses. Two ritualist NPCs (Togo and Yijo Tahn) actually don't wear hats covering their eyes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em> it is entirely possible to create something with no eyes. Funnily enough, this only barely effects your ability to actually see (the top third of the screen is blacked out and the rest is monochrome) and gives you a few extra evolution points to boot.
</li><li> Visas Marr and the miraluka in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> universe. Kreia, ironically enough, does roughly the exact same thing, "seeing with the Force." In her case she did it backwards, relying on the ability so much that her eyes atrophied.
</li><li> All the orcs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OrcAttackFlatulentRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OrcAttackFlatulentRebellion">Orc Attack: Flatulent Rebellion</a></em> were cursed with uncontrollable gas after their land was polluted by the humans. It wasn't long before they decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fartillery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fartillery">use their gas against the humans</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em>, despite that Haborym was blinded for his crimes (Which actually weren't his fault!), he's potentially one of the best swordmasters in the game, and he still has the highest dexterity of all characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> plays this fairly straight. Pok&eacute;mon with the Guts, Tangled Feet, Steadfast, and other similar abilities all gain boosts to their stats when affected by a special condition or effect (Burn, Frozen, Poisoned, Paralyzed, Confused, Flinching). Likewise, the stat-cutting downside of Burn (attack) and Paralysis (speed) are ignored for the stat being raised. On top of <em>that</em>, it's not a direct "boost" like Swords Dance, meaning that their stats can still go up. Now THAT is a superpower!
<ul><li> The attack Facade doubles in power if the user is afflicted with a status condition. It's the signature attack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Norman</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>.
</li><li> The ability Hustle reduces Accuracy and increases Attack. In the case of Deino and Zweilous, it represents their blindness and mad ferocity. A Deino with Hustle-boosted Outrage can be unstoppable in the un-evolved tiers of the metagame.
</li><li> Shedinja is an interesting example. It's the only Pok&eacute;mon in the entire series with a fixed stat that doesn't change no matter what you do &mdash; an HP stat of 1. This means that literally any damage of any kind will instantly knock it out, even if it's level 100 against a level 1 Pidgey. However, to make up for this, its unique Wonder Guard ability makes it completely immune to any attack that doesn't have a type advantage against it. Competitive players sometimes lose to it because they have nothing that can pierce its Wonder Guard.
</li><li> The ability Klutz makes the user incapable of receiving any in-battle effects from held items outside of Mega Stones, Z-Crystals, and items that affect growth. This includes both positive and negative effects, allowing them to use an otherwise self-harming item such as a Flame Orb or Iron Ball in combination with Trick or Switcheroo to hamper their opponent or to punish opponents using Trick, Switcheroo, Thief, Covet, or the ability Magician. They were also previously able to pair it with Fling before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black and White</a></em> made Klutz users incapable of using it.

Interestingly, the games <em>Deadly Alliance</em>, <em>Deception</em>, and <em>Armageddon</em> use this to defy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, as Sonya and Kira's Kiss of Death moves won't affect him (sadly, he's just as vulnerable as anyone else in <em>9</em>).

He's a fairly unrealistic depiction even when ignoring the inconsistency, since he's managed to get up to adult age and become a black operative for the Not-CIA without having hideously damaged himself (e.g. breaking a bone in a way that obviously doesn't look right once it's healed), though regardless his condition turns out to be exactly what allows him to be infected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> and only gain the cool superpowers <em>without</em> the debilitating madness all other infectees suffer from, since they all go insane from extreme pain brought about by the infection (probably what you'd expect when a virus turns your skin into metal) that Hayden can't feel.

He screams and writhes around when his real name is used and has great difficulty using normal terms for a lot of things. But his insane hallucinations also cause him to notice (and exaggerate, in warped fantasy metaphors) threats and plot points sooner than anybirdy else.

She's a great Earthbender, both because of natural talent and because she's blind: She learned how to earthbend, and how to sense her surroundings by registering vibrations in earth, from the giant badgermoles she played with when she was young. She's so skilled with it that she can even act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">Living Lie Detector</a> by monitoring their pulse like a polygraph.

He uses this not to screw up the world history, but instead to mess up Dib's life out of petty revenge. As the episode goes on, Dib gets gradually more and more disabled by the injuries sustained by piggies being inserted into important points in his life, until he's dead. Until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> dad puts him in a life-sustaining, amazingly powerful robot suit, and he shows up on Zim's doorstep to tear his place apart. To Zim's horror, the more rubber piggies Zim throws into the machine, the more heavily-armed Dib becomes, presumably because Dib's father becomes increasingly worried about his son's well-being and installs more weaponry onto the robot suit.

Amaya utilizes what appears to be American Sign Language to communicate. Her assistant, Commander Gren translates for her, most of the time. She had harbored a bigoted hatred for all elves throughout the series, but this seems to lessen by the end of Book Three.

The second category is a physical defect which in some ways can be an advantage, such as gigantism giving the advantage of extreme height in some sports (despite the health problems it causes), or not "wasting" blood on things you don't need (like legs in pilots; without legs, blood has less space to rush into during high-g maneuvers; a similar principle is used in flight suit design to prevent blood from rushing out of the head). The third category is when something artificial actually provides some advantages over the natural version (for example, some runners get a small advantage from artificial legs that can be modified specifically for running, some wheelchair users can go further distances given navigable territory than pedestrians on foot before tiring, and men without natural external sex organs who find that prostheses and toys actually provide <em>more</em> pleasure for lovers/flexibility and variation.)
</li><li> Mental disorders are frequently believed (though opinions vary) to provide some benefit to sufferers, whether increased creativity or awareness. There is quite a bit of debate over where disability ends and normal neurodiversity begins.
</li><li> On a cellular level, nearly all the genes of so-called "super-bugs" that make them resistant to antibiotics are actually defects that tend to make them inefficient and less competitive outside an otherwise sterile hospital environment; for instance, loss of certain apertures that pump nutrients through the cell membrane also render a bacterium incapable of pumping the antibiotic that would kill it through those apertures, making it immune, yet also render it incapable of ingesting much nourishment. Research into various ways of "crowding out" these resistant strains of malevolent bacteria with other more benevolent bacteria is beginning to show some promise. But since most such resistance is carried on plasmids, which bacteria can rid themselves of at any time, calling it a 'disability' may be inappropriate - more of a temporary trade-off.
</li><li> Believe it or not, castration can produce some positive effects. In addition to the vocal abilities mentioned in the Music section above, castrated men tend to live longer (since testosterone can weaken the immune system and increase risk of heart disease), grow taller (if castrated before they stop growing), and not go bald (if castrated before they start losing their hair).
</li><li> Color blind people were once highly sought after in the military, as camouflage is built around the perception of normal people but sticks out like a sore thumb to people with colorblindness.
</li><li> Because Braille has only 64 characters including the space, languages with complex writing systems in print, like Chinese and Japanese, have to render the language phonetically when writing in Braille. Braille readers learning these languages don't need to master those complex writing systems in order to be literate in those languages. Additionally, print alphabets that look very different from Latin, such as Arabic, use Braille systems that look very similar to Latin, so Arabic &#1585; and Russian &#1088;, which both represent the /r/ sound, are both rendered in Braille as &#10263;, which is the Latin letter R.
