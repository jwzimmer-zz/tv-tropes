</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationIV">Civilization IV</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationV">Civilization V</a></em>, the player can choose the "one city challenge", in which case the game bars you from settling or annexing any city after your capital is founded while the AI opponents behave as they normally would. Venice in <em>V</em> plays with these restrictions by default, but they also get bonuses to offset it, so the one-city challenge instead removes those bonuses.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting Games&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">trope name</a> comes from the term <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> games used to refer to knocking out the enemy with a jab punch or short kick. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em> games, the win icon for that round would appear as a pair of cherries. Doing it starting from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em> and onwards causes the enemy to slowly collapse (instead of flying away as usual) while reciting a special defeat quote.
<ul><li> The Cherry icon made an appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroes">Marvel Super Heroes</a></em>.
</li><li> Using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Dan</a> in general is often considered Cherry Tapping &mdash; he also has the Otoko Michi (a parody of Akuma's Shun Goku Satsu that reduces Dan's health to 1% and does about as much damage as a Medium Punch) and Premium Sign (QCF+ Kick) which only ever does 1 pixel of damage, regardless of whether it's blocked or not, and causes the "Super Flash" if you defeat them with it.
</li><li> Dudley from <em>Street Fighter III</em> has a special taunt where he throws a rose at his opponent, which does a fraction of damage. Woe to those who meet an (un)dignified KO blow this way. When the damage effect was removed from his appearance in <em>IV</em>, fans were <em>pissed</em>.
<ul><li> Dudley isn't the only one with a damaging taunt, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalTaunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalTaunt">every character's taunt has a practical use</a>, and there aren't that many unique effects to go around to the 20-character cast of 3rd Strike. Other characters with damaging taunts include Sean, who shoots a basketball, which is actually part of the Parry the Ball bonus stage in the arcade mode; Ken, whose taunt is a "come on" type hand motion, and which can damage the opponent; Ibuki, whose short hop turns into evasive overhead throw (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">wave at the viewer</a>!) when close to an opponent, and Necro, whose taunt involves sticking his tongue out at the opponent and flailing it about, which can be sustained if the taunt buttons are held. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OZiteIAJj0">Taken to the logical extreme here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Even better, Rogue's taunt did a small amount of damage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenVsStreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenVsStreetFighter">X-Men vs. Street Fighter</a></em> if you hit with the heart (Chun-Li and Sakura also can inflict damage with their taunts) and her power drain kiss move was fairly weak and easy to counter, but it's still possible to beat someone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfDeath">kissing him/her to death</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, Birdie can defeat you by throwing a beer bottle or a banana peel. Even worse is that if you let him stand around long enough, he'll flick his booger... which can kill you. Also Rainbow Mika can kill you with her mic after failing to complete her speech. Vega can kill you with a thrown rose as the opening to his V-Trigger, Bloody Kiss.
</li></ul></li><li> Again with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a>, in this case <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperGemFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperGemFighter">Super Gem Fighter</a></em>'s Felicia: defeating an opponent with nothing but the dreaded 'nummy nummy' attack<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15niy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15niy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15niy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">counts as a throw, fairly difficult to pull off, does minimal damage because it involves jumping on the opponent and <em>licking them repeatedly</em> for a second or two</span> is a <em>major</em> put-down. Just like a coarse-grade sandpaper noogie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">SoulCalibur</a></em> features a number of possibilities:
<ul><li> Using joke weapons, which often look quite silly and make amusing noises upon each strike, doing very little damage. Examples include Astaroth's giant squeaky hammer and Seung Mina's "Open Hand Slap", a giant golden hand on a stick.
</li><li> In <em>Soul Edge</em>, the first game in the series: blocking enough to lose one's weapon and then pummeling one's enemy barehanded.
</li><li> Xianghua's facefault floor wail. She literally throws a tantrum, which can do a minor amount of damage provided you're right on top of your opponent...
</li><li> Finishing off an opponent by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">attacking one of their feet</a>.
<ul><li> An example of using a useful move to do cherry tapping: Link's throw move in Soul Calibur II can actually throw the victim <em>around</em> the ring instead of <em>out</em> of it if done properly, causing a rather humiliating defeat to whomever is caught up in it.
</li></ul></li><li> Taki in later games gets Caltrops which does minor damage.
</li><li> It's possible to gain a ring out with a guard impact.
</li></ul></li><li> In both the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> and <em>Super Smash Bros Melee</em>, Luigi is the only character in the game with a taunt that does damage, and even that only works at extremely close range under certain circumstances (e.g., while the opponent is hanging off the edge of a cliff) and does very little damage. Nevertheless, it is possible to finish off an opponent with his taunt, and this makes for a truly humiliating defeat (not to mention, it has to be done at least once to unlock a special trophy, and thus obtain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>).
<ul><li> This is encouraged in Melee, thanks to one of the highest KO point bonuses being rewarded for defeating an opponent using your basic A button attack.
</li><li> It's actually a viable tactic in team battles, as many moves with fixed knockback like Fox's Reflector and Mario's Coin Jump Punch barely budge standard opponents, but will OHKO the handicapped CPUs you'll be facing.
</li><li> In <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>, in addition to Luigi's kick taunt, Snake's taunt (he has three, but they all consist of him getting under a box in different poses) can damage foes when he throws the cardboard box away at the end of the taunt.
</li><li> In <em>Super Smash Bros. 4</em> Greninja joins the fun with his Down Taunt, which does a 1% damage and has a tiny windbox that will only KO when far above any reasonable percentage. It's downplayed though, as this taunt somehow can OHKO the enemy bots in Multi-Man Melee mode, and it also has some kill confirm setups at around 100% damage into Up-Smash, though they're generally impractical at best.
</li><li> Sonic's spring jump does 3% damage if you manage to hit your opponent with the falling spring and knocks them a very short distance away. However, it still gives them enough momentum that if they collide with the underside of the stage, they'll most likely get KO'd by it.
</li><li> And in relation to gimping recoveries, the footstool jump. It does no damage and can can only be used when right on top of the opponent, but can send an opponent down to the bottom of the screen, or at least enough to keep from recovering.
</li><li> Also in <em>Brawl</em>, using Samus's Screw Attack or Pit's Propeller Blade attack is a more effective strategy against the Master Hand than more powerful or damaging moves. They only do about 12 points of damage at a time, but they prevent the Hand from being able to hit back.
</li><li> In <em>Brawl</em>, Kirby can swallow an opponent and jump off the side of the map, and when the opponent struggles out of it Kirby can jump on their head finishing them off. This can be a suicide technique.
</li><li> Mr. Game and Watch's turtle. That thing looks <strong>ferocious.</strong>
<ul><li> Mr. Game and Watch is made of this, at least as far as unconventionally lame-looking weapons. Aside from the brokenness of the turtle, his most powerful aerial is a packing box, his slowest but most powerful smash attack is a scuba helmet, and he can even kill you with <em>sausages</em> by hitting them out of a double-jump.
</li><li> Mr. Game and Watch's Judgement Hammer can easily be this, as it rolls a d10 to determine its attack power. Anything below 7 might as well be a worthless jab, though these hits can still cause special damage effects. However, anything rolled above this leaves Cherry Tapping territory and becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> territory...especially 9.
</li></ul></li><li> Diddy Kong's Down Special move, "Banana Peel", throws a banana peel on the stage. You can then pick it up and throw it to damage opponents, and yes, you can use it to land the final blow on <em>any</em> of the bosses.
</li><li> Death by Mr. Saturn. Throwing them at your opponent barely does anything... Unless your opponent is shielding, because Mr. Saturn's main property is one-hit shield breaking. Since breaking a shield gives heavy knockback (enough that lightweights can fly off at low percentages), this would technically allow your character to win without even laying a finger on the opponent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">Lethal Joke Item</a>, indeed.
</li><li> If playing on an especially confined stage, it's possible to get into insane damage numbers (such as 999%, which is the damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">cap</a>) where Mario's <strong>Fireball</strong> will give enough knockback to send a character into next week twice.
</li><li> Finishing someone in mid-air by lobbing an item rather than using it as intended is usually very satisfying. The ultimate of this always seems to be Pok&eacute; Ball to the head, thrown <em>by</em> a non-legendary Pok&eacute;mon (especially Pichu), from which springs a post-victory Goldeen.
</li><li> For that matter, getting owned by any Pok&eacute;mon that doesn't do damage. Some actually do decent damage, though.
<ul><li> Piplup, for example, is a cheery-looking blue penguin Pok&eacute;mon. On a flat suspended stage, it will sweep you all the way across, then ride you down into the pit.
</li><li> Getting knocked out by Marill (who moves in a similar manner to Piplup).
</li></ul></li><li> In terms of humiliation, nothing is more satisfying than pulling off a successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Jigglypuff</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">Sniper</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Bomb</a>. Over and over again. There will be much weeping and gnashing of teeth in your opponents.
<ul><li> Jigglypuff's Down Special, "Rest", with the right timing and position (very slightly above the opponent), is an extremely powerful attack after which Jigglypuff falls asleep for a few seconds. If you miss, Jigglypuff just falls asleep anyway and the opponent can take their sweet time to launch a fully charged Side Smash, a Falcon Punch or some other slow (or not) powerful attack, making it an extremely risky (at high percentages anyway) move.
</li><li> Jigglypuff's Cherry Tapping prowess does not end here. It can finish off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Tabuu</a> in <em>Brawl</em> by singing to him, because Sing (Up Special) does damage to airborne bosses rather than lulling them to sleep.
</li></ul></li><li> In terms of outright embarrassing your opponent, nothing will sting more than losing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Captain Olimar</a> <em>without his Pikmin</em>. Olimar is virtually useless without Pikmin, so some players will resort to severely handicapping Olimar by simply not using Pikmin... because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">it amuses them</a>, usually. Otherwise known as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ssbwiki.com/Nolimar">Nolimar<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> ('No' Pikmin), LOL-imar, and Solimar (Solo Olimar), Olimar loses many of the abilities that makes him among the most aggressive and vicious characters in the game. Without Pikmin, Olimar loses <em>all</em> of his smashes, <em>almost all</em> of his aerials, the Pikmin Toss and Pikmin Pluck special moves (for obvious reasons), his dominating ability to grab, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfPeople">Pikmin Chain</a> tether recovery. He's also lighter and easier to knockout, too. Nolimar relies solely on six weak attacks to put up any offense (did I mention he doesn't have any useful finishers anymore? Yeah, you'll have to push your opponents <strong>beyond 160%</strong> before even thinking about a kill), and relies on his (now horribly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a>) recovery, his whistle guard, and skills to survive... Good luck beating any competent Smasher with Nolimar.
<ul><li> It is a similar (though not as extreme) situation for the Ice Climbers. Killing one of the two Ice Climbers leaves the other Ice Climber severely handicapped in terms of power, jump, and recovery. It's satisfying to finish off other characters with the weirdo duo to begin with, and even more satisfying if you only have one left. That said, a solo Climber still has a full range of moves, unlike Nolimar; they just have reduced effectiveness.
</li></ul></li><li> At least all of the above examples involve attacking. Some tournament matches are decided with a <em>Footstool Jump</em>.
</li><li> Using a countering move in order to defeat a foe by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">counterattacking</a> is highly satisfying, especially since it often doesn't do a huge deal of damage (if you're only lucky enough to counter a simple light attack), and they can only blame themselves for attacking you at the wrong time.
</li><li> When Robin uses a spell enough times, they casually toss their book to the side. The book can be picked up, though; it looks dainty and harmless, but if you chuck it at an opponent, it can kill them at high enough percentages. Meaning one can go a whole stock hammering an opponent with powerful spells, only to finish them off by throwing the empty book at them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand">God Hand</a></em> has the <em>Poke of God</em>; a move that literally <em><strong>pokes</strong></em> a demon to death once they reach critical health. And it's complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughTrack">Laugh Track</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefJamSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefJamSeries">Def Jam Series</a></em> games, Rapper Capone's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> has him launching a brutal barrage of blows, but when he goes for the last punch he pauses, looks at the opponent, then simply <em>pushes</em> them over.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em> makes use of gruesome fatalities, one surefire (and extremely amusing) way to show your opponent how badly they got pwned is through "Humiliation". If you bring your opponent down to his/her breaking point while you still have your full life meter, you can force your opponent to dance themselves to death, as shown by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V1lYUDXYgg">this video compilation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomClashOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomClashOfSuperHeroes">Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a></em>, in which, aside from the classic joke character Dan, extreme humiliation can be rendered by means of Jin Saotome's contextually deadly and surreal taunt (which involves him instantly stripping down and rubbing a towel across his back fast enough for it to catch fire).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>: Deadpool has a taunt that does damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">(a literal text balloon appears saying "TAUNT BUTTON!" or "THIS IS MY TAUNT!")</a>. While it can be used to land a finishing blow, it can also be cancelled out of, making it possible to use this taunt in a combo, which is somehow even more humiliating.
</li><li> A variation of this can occur when tagging a teammate in. Team enters by doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">Dynamic Entry</a> for minor damage. This can also work as a knockout blow if the opponents health is small enough.
</li><li> In Ultimate, we have Phoenix Wright's bad evidence, useless random items that must be thrown away to make room for proper evidence. Doing so only causes a minuscule amount damage on the opponent if it hits. But if your opponent just happens to have a minuscule amount of health...
</li><li> KOing an opponent with an <strong>Objection!</strong> is not unheard of, it does a fair amount of damage for a single move that's used solely to transition to Turnabout Mode, and is used to cause stuns in said mode. If you're in Investigation mode or don't have 3 pieces of good evidence, Phoenix yells <strong><span>Hold It!</span></strong> instead, which does pathetic damage and needs to be used a lot more times to cause stun, making it very impractical. Still possible to K.O. though.
</li><li> Super Skrull has a move called Worm Stomp. He stomps the ground. It's only useful with an opponent lying on the floor, but there are much better alternatives for that that do more damage and can be comboed out of. Worm Stomp seems to exist solely to deal a pathetic amount of damage to a pathetic person.
</li><li> If you win a round in <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> and your last hit came from a light punch or kick, the victory icon is a pair of cherries.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2">Mortal Kombat II</a></em>, the fight against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Jade is unlocked by winning a certain fight using only Low Kicks. Weirdly, the same tactic - jumping low kicks ad infinitum - is one of the best ways to defeat the final boss.
</li><li> Later games also subverted the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> by having other options available, which are usually meant to humiliate your enemy further. Like <em>Friendship</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX">Mortal Kombat X</a></em>, Erron Black can throw Caltrops on the floor, which can actually down an opponent with low-enough health. He also has Tarkatan Stab in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Outlaw variation</a>, which lets the opponent bleed out over time, and also down them. That's right, he has <em>two</em> cherry-tapping moves, and you can use them at the same time (if using Outlaw variation) for <em>even more</em> damage.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX">Mortal Kombat X</a></em>, Kotal Kahn's Sun Ray move can be used for a humiliating finish. The Sun Ray creates a beam of light Kotal Kahn can stand in to heal a small amount of health over time, but it can also deal a small amount of damage to opponents (about .5% of a life bar per tick). Naturally, being killed by such a silly move is humbling at the best of times, but when done at the right distance, it will also trigger a brutality finisher. What a burn.
</li><li> In fact, Kotal Kahn is capable of a rare self-inflicted cherry tap. His Blood Sacrifice move usually has him inflict a small cut across his chest with his ceremonial dagger, slightly damaging himself in exchange for powering up his next few attacks. Do it a little too close to death though, and he'll eviscerate himself on the spot, spilling his guts and ending the match.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokaiTenkaichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokaiTenkaichi">Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi</a></em> series makes little to no attempt to balance the fighters. Therefore, most fights are heavily imbalanced, and using weaker characters is a standard handicap for skilled players.
<ul><li> Videl is an underpowered character whose attacks often have embarrassingly girly imagery (which really doesn't make a whole lot of sense, as Videl's... well, not all that girly.)
</li><li> Hercule. Not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">another Hercule</a> flinches from his basic melee attacks. Humorously enough, he also possesses one of the most powerful specials in the game, "Present for ya!" (at least in <em>Budokai 2</em>). He can quickly become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> if you pump up his health, Ki, and Blast 2 stats because of it.
</li><li> Using a regular, uncharged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki blast</a> to finish your opponent is also quite humiliating for them. Bonus points if you wait for your opponent to charge his/her ki to the max before tapping the one button needed to end it, stopping their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">counter-attack</a> before it begins.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NarutoGekitouNinjaTaisen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NarutoGekitouNinjaTaisen">Naruto Gekitou Ninja Taisen</a></em> (<em>Clash of Ninja</em>) fighting games, there are the odd characters who can be used to defeat your opponent in extremely embarrassing ways. Among them is Tsunade - she is super strong and uses melee attacks, but she has one attack where she swings her arm up into her opponent's chin (only stunning them) and then instantly flicks them in the forehead with <em>one finger</em>, sending them flying. This actually comes directly from the manga/anime; she used it in an early appearance to demonstrate to Naruto that being able to beat Gaara does <em><strong>not</strong></em> mean you can now throw down with one of the Sannin.
</li><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a>: Gekitou Ninja Taisen/Clash of Ninja</em> character, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> is Akamaru, Kiba's dog. He doesn't have many good attacks, he just lunges at his opponent and occasionally hangs on with his teeth. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse">he's tiny compared to the other characters, thus nearly impossible to hit</a> if you don't have area attacks. Losing to the little white dog is embarrassing, but understandable.
<ul><li> Tsunade's flick-attack is also in <em>Naruto: Clash Of Ninja Revolution</em>, and another character, Kakashi, can pull out and read a book in the middle of a fight. He counters you if you attack him while he's reading, though.
</li><li> Also in <em>Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution</em>: Itachi has a combo move which ends with his shadow-clone giving the opponent a light push backwards, where the real Itachi is waiting with a kunai thrust that appears to be no more forceful than slowly straightening his arm. Still does quite a bit of damage.
</li><li> Finally, to an extent, Guy's ultimate attack. While actually capable of doing damage, there is something particularly embarrasing about being called a great person, and then summarily hugged... TO DEATH! (DUN! DUN! DUUUUUNNN!)
</li><li> In the <em>Narutimate Hero/Ultimate Ninja</em> games, if you're playing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Yellow Flash</a>/Minato Namikaze and get your butt kicked by Konohamaru, you have the right to be humiliated and mocked beyond all reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> character Neko Arc Chaos holds out a cigarette when crouching, and while you move forward towards opponent, it actually burns opponents with one damage, and knocks them down.
<ul><li> Urban legend says that if you kill an opponent with this "move", the world ends. It would be quite a feat though, as the average Health Points on characters is around 12,000.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RobotArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RobotArena">Robot Arena</a> 2</em>, it happens oh so often that despite only having one wheel left, you get a lucky attack in on your opponent and leaving them hanging over the edge of a Pit, giving you a perfect opportunity to shove them down and win, even in your wrecked up state.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice-packed</a> game <em>Bikini Karate Babes</em>, Persephone's grab move allows you to <em> spank</em> your opponent into submission, while she struggles and squeals in embarrassment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lugaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lugaru">Lugaru</a></em>, you play an anthropomorphic rabbit, frequently having to fight multiple powerful opponents. At one stage, you fight six wolves, preferably one at a time, but it is fairly easy to get all six pissed off at you. You can then kill them with a normal punch. It's not a pathetic move, but this is the game where moves include leaping through the air, kicking people with both legs, and throwing them hundreds of feet backwards.
<ul><li> Alternately you can kill enemies by punching the bodies of their former comrades at them. It's hard to aim, harder to time, and does do respectable damage. Still, it's hilarious.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses">Rumble Roses</a></em>, there is a Humiliation Gauge, which, when full (the enemy's, not yours), makes the character blush and gasp "N-no!". Afterwards, you can use a H-Move, which is a very powerful submission... and as you can guess from the name, most are embarrassing (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">and hot</a>). Some would have you scratching your head trying to find the "H" in the move, but just blame it on the character being too naive or something. From the options, you can even set Humiliation Finish Only, so that the loser must be humiliated. Fun in multiplayer. In the story mode, one of the characters insists on having a H-Finish Only match after losing once, because she really wants to win. She does not.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BushidoBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BushidoBlade">Bushido Blade</a></em>, the rapier is a fiddly and unsatisfying weapon. It also looks puny and toy-like in the hands of the heavier characters. However, it's the one weapon with no backswing, meaning it's impossible to trap a rapier-wielder against a wall where using any other weapon would cause their swings to collide with the wall and stun them, and in the hands of a strong character it will punch through your defenses irritatingly often. And you just got slain by a giant guy holding an oversized toothpick. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAcceptableBreakFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAcceptableBreakFromReality">An Acceptable Break From Reality</a> given how the game is stylized; real rapiers were heavier than most gamers would imagine, required more strength from the user than most two-handed weapons, but made up for it with deadly thrusts, long reach, and a lightning-quick bypass ("disengage" - ask a fencer) of the defense.
</li><li> Nina Williams and her sister, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>, can beat a huge demon monster thing by kicking it in the sack. Repeatedly.
<ul><li> Or, you could always try winning a match with Hwoarang/Baek/Christie/Eddy. Without kicking. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a></em> effectively makes this a deadly tactic. If you keep jabbing at a stunned opponent, they won't be able to move, and you can just keep chipping away at their health meter until they fall down. Its possible to do this with up to six people at the one time if you're positioned well, have good timing, and perhaps have a bit of luck. Can be hilarious to watch as six guys go down to slow jabbing.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em> players can use Cherry Tapping to equally deadly effect. By simply turning around before you finish your combo, you can continuously jab your opponents, beating them to death little by little without giving them the opportunity to attack back. And, just like in SoR, in FF, you can use said jabs against multiple opponents at the same time, provided you can corral them into the same position.
<ul><li> Cody from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a> is a playable character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a>. He has a super move called Final Destruction, that... has him cherry tap his opponent just as the example descrives.

The humiliation that comes from being defeated by this is increased by the fact that she often adds "Fluuuuuffy-wuffy!" in a sing-song voice when doing it.
<ul><li> While the taunt itself is rather weak, back in in the first Continuum Shift the "taunt loop" was one of Taokaka's strongest and hardest combo to use, dealing about <em>60%</em> damage when pulled off perfectly.
</li><li> Later entires in the series introduce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">Makoto Nanaya</a>, who has a special that involves throwing an acorn at the opponent. For one damage. In a game where base HP is 10,000, and the squishiest still have 9,000. To add insult to injury, the move is only available to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Unlimited Makoto</a>, meaning the rest of her arsenal is supercharged.
</li><li> Chronophantasma and onward has Izayoi, whose taunt not only does a little bit of damage, but it's very easy to combo into from one of her teleport specials.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of challenges for the Wii version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> are effectively this, particularly ones that involve KO'ing your opponent in less than a minute, in a certain small number of punches, or ignoring your natural instinct to avoid your opponent's attacks. Also, most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a> attacks reward you for counterattacking them with an <em>instant knockdown</em> for an otherwise minimal-damage punch.

For most characters, managing to perform an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Exburst</a> will do a lot of damage, even if it wasn't performed perfectly. However, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Gilgamesh's</a> Exburst, failure to perform it perfectly will result in it doing <em>single-digit damage</em>. However, it <em>does</em> do damage, so it is in fact entirely possible to kill an opponent outright using the game's greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> move. <em>Sweet victory.</em>

Its primary function is to power up his Mist Finer special but its perfectly possible to SLASH the opponent with a little penny.
</li><li> Olivia of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleFantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleFantasia">Battle Fantasia</a></em> has a special throw that deals <em>one</em> damage. Its primary use is that it leaves the opponent <strong>very</strong> briefly staggered and at exactly the right range to hit them with her C attack or some of her special moves as a follow-up... but it's possible to weaken an opponent, then finish them off with one or more applications of it. There's even an achievement/trophy for managing this in arcade mode.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Person Shooter&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Melee kills in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> games. One exception would be the single-player mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a>: World at War</em>, as the fact that the melee attack animation (whether it hits or misses) interrupts the reloading animation makes the melee attack a <em>lifesaver</em> when you get banzai charged. Also, the bayonet versions of the Arisaka and the M1 Garand give a little extra reach.
<ul><li> Very much subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em>: Lightweight (move faster) + Commando (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyLunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyLunge">Deadly Lunge</a>) perks + Tactical Knife attachment for pistols (attack and recover faster), with perhaps Marathon (infinite sprint), means it is very much possible to eschew guns and use the knife as a primary weapon. You'd be hard-pressed to find a game without at least one player doing this effectively.
</li><li> On the knife issue, it's actually easier to knife because the server accounts it faster than a bullet. So a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">FAMAS with Stopping Power</a> vs a knife user at, oh say 5 feet (Commando Perk used) lunging at him, knife user wins. Granted the guy may have already killed you on his screen....
</li><li> One of the killstreak rewards in <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> is a Care Package, which is a crate that is airlifted and dropped wherever you throw the signal flare. Naturally, being dropped at a high elevation, it is possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">make a Care Package land on your opponent and kill him.</a> There are actually in-game challenges that involve doing this.
</li><li> In <em>Modern Warfare</em> and <em>World at War</em> multiplayer, a thrown grenade will do a tiny amount of damage if it smacks into someone before exploding. If they die because of this, the icon in the killbox displaying the weapon of their demise is hilarious. You can also do it if you fire the M203 in <em>Modern Warfare</em> at someone too close for it to arm and explode. It's an instant kill as long as it hits.
<ul><li> Flash bangs do a little bit of damage when they explode and it's possbile (especially in hardcore mode, when players have less health points) to finish off previously wounded enemy with them - which is more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as the concussive blast of the detonation can injure and the heat can still burn.
</li><li> Players often use a flashbang to kill an opponent in last stand/second chance mode, so they can just lob it over cover to get the kill.
</li><li> <em>World At War</em> has an achievement for killing Gen. Amsel in the first Soviet campaign level with a pistol. The deal here is that first off, there's only one pistol in the entire level, and it has about 15 to 20 bullets (though you can get more by fatally wounding an enemy soldier, let him take out his own pistol, then finish him). Secondly, when you get the opportunity to shoot Amsel, he's surrounded by several soldiers with more pouring in every second, half of which open fire on you. Third, you're roughly 200 yards away and can't get closer (you're meant to use a sniper rifle to kill Amsel). And finally, if all that weren't enough, the pistol is so weak that only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshot</a> will kill him from that range.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tribes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tribes">Tribes</a> 2</em> offers another exception where the shocklance (only melee weapon) is not only a viable weapon, but incredibly dangerous in the right hands.
<ul><li> More in line with the trope is the Blaster: possibly the least damage per shot of any weapon in the game, the messages that appear in the chat window when a kill is made with it specifically invoke this trope; for example, something along the lines of "<em>Player 1</em> was fatally embarrassed by <em>Player 2</em>'s pea shooter." and "<em>Player 1</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag">pinged<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <em>Player 2</em> to death".
</li><li> The Blaster is fairly unique in that you can skillfully <em>ricochet</em> shots off the floor or walls to strike opponents... <em>or yourself</em>, if you're not careful!
</li></ul></li><li> Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em>, punching (unless you are running while punching) does less than one tenth of a player's health in multiplayer. Of course, if you have the invincibility power up, you can corner somebody and punch them to death. Of course, you better pray that they don't have a fusion pistol.
<ul><li> In the original <em>Marathon</em>, there is a regular level where you have to kill the four Juggernauts, AKA "The Big Floaty Thing What Kicks Our Asses". Three of them are floating over lava, meaning it is best to break out the rocket launcher on them. The fourth is an example of this trope, as it is hovering over solid ground, meaning you can literally run up to its face and start punching away, without any risk of being damaged (unless another Pfor is present in the same room). It won't fire its Warpedos when you're that close, and its arm cannons literally cannot hit a target right in front of its face. (Of course, once it starts falling, you have to make tracks for the other side of the room to avoid Massive Damage.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Jedi Knight</a></em> and the sequels, this would work in the inverse in that killing a lightsaber-using enemy with ranged weapons, particularly a mere blaster, instead of with a lightsaber of your own, would be pretty humiliating. Good luck pulling that one off, though.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em>, you can humiliate your opponent by killing him with a flare. A flare is really only for illumination, but does a single point of damage if it hits an opponent.
<ul><li> Not a bad idea to throw out a token flare while firing if you can. It doesn't happen often, but getting a direct or near-direct flare to the face will light up the enemy's screen with a yellow glow and do a good job of blinding them. Failing that, it makes them more noticable and unable to hide in dark areas.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> has a number of possibilities:
<ul><li> Your heavily-armored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> can actually get killed by a <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym0BtwmCvoc">cheap plastic traffic cone!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>
</li><li> In a Capture the Flag game, getting killed by someone holding the flag. Flagbearers originally had no defenses besides hitting opponents with the flag itself, though they get a single pistol in the later games. There's also an achievement for staving someone's head in using their own flag on a Legendary map. The real kicker? It's worth 50 Gamerscore.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>, the Frag Grenade does a small amount of damage (one health bar) when it hits an opponent directly (before exploding). Killing people in this way is rare but very hilarious because their corpse often ends up glitched into the floor.
</li><li> Killing enemies with the oddball/skull is also a favorite.
</li><li> Even though it is capable of dishing out large amounts of damage (especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> when you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWield">Dual Wield</a> them), in many circles it is considered dishonorable to be killed with the Needler (or "gay pink gun" as it's oft known). This could be because the Needler is usually a easy way to kill someone (some versions can drain your shield so fast that you could blink and miss it happening), and it doesn't help that the thing outright insta-kills you if you have no shields.
</li><li> And, of course, there's always the good old molly-thwap (getting smacked in the back by a weapon melee, which is always a one-hit-kill).
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, the humble human pistol was absurdly accurate and could kill an enemy combatant in 2-3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshots</a> from a safe distance. In large arenas, this was an easy way to win matches and piss people off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> has a few of these:
<ul><li> The pistol, a secondary for the scout and engineer, does about 15 damage a shot. Not only that, but it has some of the worst bullet spread at long distance. The one thing it has going for it is its fast firing speed.
</li><li> Every class has a "kill-taunt" associated with a certain weapon, in which an elaborate, impractical (and usually very vulnerable) animation ends with a short-range attack that will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">insta-kill</a> any opponent. (The Pyro does a hadouken, the Sniper stabs someone with an arrow, the Heavy quick-draws a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerGun">Finger Gun</a>.) The Engineer, the last class to be updated, actually has <em>two</em> kill taunts. The Pyro has <strong>three</strong> (two of which were introduced in its second major update).
<ul><li> The true humiliation of this comes at the end of the Match, when the losing team drops their weapons, and the winners are supposed to be able to slaughter them for fun. The losers can only taunt, but the above taunts <em>can still kill</em>. You think Cherry Tapping is bad? How about getting Cherry Tapped by the guy who <em>already lost</em>?
</li></ul></li><li> Two videos showcased a Pyro utterly decimating an entire enemy team with nothing but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axe</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlareGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlareGun">flaregun</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTennisWithTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTennisWithTheBoss">airblast.</a> One fansite was so <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100326022129/http://www.ubercharged.net/2008/09/26/don-newman/">impressed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, they began a machinima.
</li><li> Certain defense and support classes (Engineer, Medic, Sniper, arguably Spy) are simply not supposed to engage in head-on combat with the front-line classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy). Consequently, being beaten to death with a pipe wrench or bonesaw can be quite the humiliation.
</li><li> The Scout has The Sandman, a bat that has the unique ability to hit baseballs at the enemy. Though this is primarily for stunning opponents, the ball also does a very small amount of damage. Killing someone with the ball even has its own kill icon!
</li><li> Most projectiles, including the Sandman and the Flare Gun, can be reflected back at the opponent and can possibly kill them. These also have their own kill icons, with every single possibility present. This means you can kill another Pyro with a deflected flare gun shot; since Pyros don't suffer afterburn, this is the ultimate Cherry Tapping (the flare itself does negligible damage unless the enemy is on fire, which a Pyro never will be). Especially harrowing is when a sniper gets headshotted by his own arrow, as they travel much faster than baseballs or flares, to the point that a mid-range arrow requires the pyro to gasblast <em>before</em> the arrow is even fired.
</li><li> The Scout also has the Fan O' War, his weapon from the Shogun Pack. It trades 75% of the regular melee damage dealt in exchange for causing all damage taken by the target to be mini-crits for 10 seconds, and performing full crits whenever it would minicrit. Getting an actual kill with this is even more humiliating than a Sandman ball, because it can do a respectable 45 damage on a full critical hit: the Fan O' War does a whopping 26 per full crit.
<ul><li> The Wrap Assassin is another scout melee weapon which, although it does slightly more damage, has the added bonus of allowing you to literally beat someone to death with a cardboard tube.
</li><li> Doing just slightly more damage than that is the Short Circuit, whose main function is destroying enemy projectiles, but also does 5 damage. For a time however, it became an extremely powerful weapon after the smissmas 2013 update, making it shoot much faster, effectively ensuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> in seconds even for high health classes and completely shutting down projectiles. Fortunately, its reign of terror would be ended later with various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfs</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Scout melee weapon is the Holy Mackerel, a fish wrapped in foil. It has the same stats as the default bat (Meaning it has low damage output, but a faster firing speed), but it differs in the fact that it keeps track of every hit you make on an enemy while you're using it. And when you actually kill an enemy with it, the screen will show "FISH KILL" just to drive the humiliation home. The official description even shows this:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Holy Mackerel Description</strong>: Getting hit with a fish has got to be humiliating.
</div><ul><li> There is a variant of this weapon, the Unarmed Combat. It's functionally identical except it uses "ARM KILL" instead of "FISH KILL". You're basically slapping someone to death. Double points if the enemy's a Spy; the Unarmed Combat is a Spy's severed arm. You're literally slapping him to death with his own arm.
</li><li> The Pyro has a similar choice in the Hot Hand, a glove that grants a rather weak two-hit slap attack. Hitting with the Hot Hand speeds you up briefly, but even both hits deal less damage than a stock melee weapon (and the entire point to a Pyro is having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">a much better option than stock melee</a>). However, it announces whenever you successfully slap someone, and puts "SLAP KILL" into the kill feed on the rare times you kill someone with it.
</li><li> The Mantreads are a "weapon" for the soldier which allow him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> other players dealing triple his fall damage to anyone he lands on. A shame that fall damage rarely exceeds 30 to 40 damage in a game where even the weakest classes have 125 health and you can see why the boot's kill icon rarely shows in the kill feed. Many players do not even recognize it and will ask what item caused it.
</li><li> Most spies will run away if they fail a backstab on you. Some, however, prefer to stab you to death anyway, despite their knife having the lowest DPS of all default melee weapons. This is common enough to be known as "butterknifing", and is quite the humiliation, as it implies the player who killed you cannot even play properly (he'd have backstabbed you if he could).
</li><li> Mannpower mode introduced the Grappling Hook. Hooking an enemy deals a whopping 1 damage (and applies a bleed effect as long as you hold on).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Trolldier</a> build in general. The gist of the build is basically taking the class with various powerful primary and secondary weapons and sticking him with a rocket launcher that does no damage, reducing him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">rocket jumping</a> at people with the intent of beating them to death with a shovel. It can be surprisingly effective, due to the Market Gardener enabling crits while rocket jumping (a Market Gardener crit will kill the vast majority of classes and cripple the rest).
</li><li> Sentry guns are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">powerful enough to chew up anyone who enters their effective range</a>, but they have a finite turn rate, meaning that it is possible to strafe around a Sentry quickly enough that it cannot lock on. Consequently, it's not unheard of for a skilled player to <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/3NViW3dttys?t=41s">jump onto an unattended Sentry and poke it to death with a melee weapon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> "Fat Scout" Heavies eschew the insane damage of the minigun for the shotgun, which, though hardly useless (it can kill most classes in two shots at close range) is normally a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">Emergency Weapon</a> for the Heavy and denies use of the highly useful self-healing Sandvich. Not needing to rev up the minigun makes them more agile, but the Heavy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> by nature, so it's just a difference between "slow" and "immobile." Dying to a Fat Scout, though hardly impossible (after all, you have a giant health pool and similar damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">to a Scout</a>, hence the name), is fairly ignominious.
</li></ul></li><li> Also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortressClassic">Team Fortress Classic</a></em> was full of this, most players that see a spy faking his death stand on top of him so he can't stand up, teabag a little, then kill him with the crowbar.
<ul><li> On the other end, Spies have a tranquilizer pistol which fires near-painless darts... at a very slow rate. Considering spies also have grenades, a double-barrel shotgun, and an instant-kill knife, tranq-kills are so rare they're stuck borrowing the kill-icon from the Scout's puny nailgun.
</li><li> Scouts drop a handful of sharp caltrops, which clumsy enemies can step on. Like tranqs, they're near-painless and intended only to slow enemies. Considering the class that drops them is more-flight-than-fight, and caltrops rest visibly on the floor, and each injury from a caltrop slows the enemy (from walking onto more), getting him to impale-his-foot-to-death is extremely special.
</li><li> Concussion grenades of the Medic and Scout don't inflict any damage, but they might propel an enemy high enough into the air for the landing to kill him. There's no better way to cherry-tap than killing a manner which isn't even recognized as a frag.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedOrchestra">Red Orchestra</a></em>, getting killed by a melee attack (whether it's from being hit by the butt of the weapon or the bayonet) is considered extremely humiliating. Usually only possible on snipers who don't take care to watch their surroundings.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20060331">Knife kills<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are the classic humiliation kill.
</li><li> In <em>Source</em> and <em>Global Offensive</em>, the <em>impact</em> from any grenades does exactly one point of damage, making it possible to kill someone with a flashbang or a smoke grenade (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">they even have unique kill icons</a>). This leads to the "Dodgeball" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> where everyone is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> with an infinite amount of grenades that do nothing but inflict impact damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, you can deal the killing blow on the final boss with the crowbar, by jumping inside his split-open cranium and whacking his brain. Not to mention you can also beat tanks until they explode with just your trusty crowbar. However, the big tank's explosion will kill you if you are too close.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a>: Deathmatch</em>, the 9mm pistol is usually scoffed at (beyond the crowbar or stunstick, the two melee weapons). However with a little luck and skill it its possible to get at least a couple kills per life thanks to its ability to shoot as fast as you can click and its huge ammo supply. Most servers play a clip saying "HUMILIATION" when killing or being killed with/by the pistol.
</li><li> <em>The Specialists</em> mod is all about stylishly blowing people away by running up and down walls with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyWasKungFuFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyWasKungFuFighting">leaping kicks</a>. Or you can take the Ruger .22 pistol, which kills after <em>several headshots</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HellgateLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HellgateLondon">Hellgate: London</a></em> requires this for one of the achievements - killing the final boss of the game with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead">cricket bat</a>.
</li><li> Though filled with dozens (or hundreds even) of deadly weapons, many of the Gadgets in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> series have potentially fatal secondary uses.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142">Battlefield 2142</a></em>, there are awards for getting a certain number of pistol or knife kills. The game also encourages knife kills with the inclusion of collectible dog tags. But the real Cherry Tapping weapon is probably the lowly smoke grenade. It provides a pitiful amount of smoke when used properly, but if thrown at a player, it can knock off that final hit point. It gets its own kill message, but sadly, perpetual stats for smokes aren't kept. Other possibilities include standard grenades (which also inflict striking damage), assault rifle rockets used inside their minimum range (striking instead of exploding), parachute stomping, roadkill by air vehicles, and the commander's supply drop.
<ul><li> Smoke grenades do exactly 2 damage if you hit someone with them. In later games, hand-thrown grenades do no damage, while those fired from launchers are capable of one-hit kills.
</li></ul></li><li> The defibrillator, if it successfully connects with an enemy trooper (it can't be used to teamkill for obvious reasons; accidentally zap someone twice when trying to revive them? oops!), counts as an <em>instant kill</em> no matter the victim's armour type <em>or</em> their current health. In 2142, however, it overheats after three rapid uses, so you have to be careful in order to kill with it, as the range is also very lacking. Nerfed further in <em>Bad Company 2</em> in that 2 shocks are required for a kill. <em>Battlefield 3</em> almost broke the streak, requiring (but never mentioning anywhere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">except forums</a>) the defibrillator to be charged.
</li><li> For extra special hilarity, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectReality">Project Reality</a></em> mod for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2">Battlefield 2</a></em> has the Civilian Collaborator in its Insurgency style gameplay. Civis carry no weapons and meager equipment, including a rock for irritating soldiers. Their saving grace is that (unless disqualified by the rules of engagement) they must be arrested (Melee'd) to deal with them (shooting them = + 60s respawn). So civis can ping rocks off armor with impunity (useless, but incredibly annoying for the armor crew). Alternatively, you can find that annoying sniper and crack him in the head with a couple rocks (or six to the torso), which is easily the most embarrassing way to die in the mod, especially since the civi then picks up your rifle and turns it the other direction. In previous mod versions, it was also possible to run over civis to arrest them, which led to sappers placing a pile of IEDs under a civi's feet and waiting for heavy armor to try to run them over.
</li><li> The Repair Tool, used for fixing friendly vehicles and dismantling enemy ones while they're occupied, can also "repair" enemy infantry. Particuarly humilating on a prone sniper or drone operator who can't react fast enough to shoot you.
<ul><li> Doing so is one half of the unlock criteria for the G53 submachine gun in <em>Battlefield 3</em>. After unlocking that, blowing up an occupied enemy vehicle with the repair tool is part of the unlock criteria for the QBZ-95B SMG.
</li></ul></li><li> Both the EOD Bot and MAV are capable of earning roadkills by colliding with enemies in <em>Battlefield 3</em>.
</li><li> The flashbang grenade is intended to blind and stun enemies, but also inflicts some minor blast damage. But as an explosive, it also has the ability to set off other nearby explosives. It can make for lively chatter when a full-strength main battle tank is reduced to flaming wreckage by a mere flashbang <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that set off mines or C4</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1">Battlefield 1</a></em> includes, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2mm_Kolibri">Kolibri pistol<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">a pitiful 2.7 mm pistol that's smaller than the character's hands</a> and takes roughly <em>four headshots</em> to kill someone.
<ul><li> Kills with gas masks, periscopes and syringes are possible. For the gas mask and periscope, the user has to crawl into an enemy's player model and put it on, causing 45 damage inexplicably. Syringes have a charge time, and when fully charged, can kill a full health enemy player.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a></em>, the normal pistol is a pretty wimpy weapon, dealing so little damage that you have to hit with every shot fired from cold until it overheats to kill a normal trooper (don't even ask about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Wookies</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Droidekas</a>). Kill six people with it in one life, however, and you get arguably the best award weapon in the game: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperPistol">a pistol that for all intents and purposes is a sniper rifle</a> with an unzoomed reticule and sixteen-shot clips.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine">Unreal Engine</a> in it's early builds (up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> or so) allowed people to damage others by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">dropping on top of their heads</a> for about one point of damage; this allowed for some humiliating kills (and deaths) in both the single and multiplayer games of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em> franchise.
</li><li> The bosses of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> have many hit points, hit for massive damage and of course have predictable patterns that enable a player to kill them without getting hurt. As a result there are a number of videos showing someone killing a Cyberdemon or Spider Mastermind with a lowly pistol or even fists.
<ul><li> In <em>Doom 3</em> you can bludgeon people to death with the <em>flashlight</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The human Medic class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnemyTerritoryQuakeWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnemyTerritoryQuakeWars">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</a></em> carries a defibrillator. When applied to a Strogg rather than an injured teammate, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">results may be hilarious.</a>
</li><li> If you kill an opponent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIIIArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIIIArena">Quake III: Arena</a></em> with the Gauntlet, the announcer will intone "Humiliation!"
</li><li> The FPS <em>Operation7</em> lets you use your firearms as melee weapons &mdash; whether by long gun (held at both ends) or by pistol, machine pistol, shotgun, or even a GRENADE, it's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PistolWhipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PistolWhipping">beating the guy to death with your weapon</a>. Knives are premium content for time-limited use (pay real money for a certain number of consecutive days in which you can equip them), but can be used as traditional FPS knives... or thrown.
</li><li> If you play VS mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>, nothing spells humiliation for the infected players than having a survivor beat you to death with his gun (or worse, his medkit) instead of shooting you. Although, Boomers explode when killed and Tanks are not affected by shoves.
<ul><li> This actually was both effective and humiliating, since the survivors can just huddle in a corner during big horde rushes and basically be untouchable. Even worse, a glitch meant you could hit the button for shoving, then quickly switching weapons or equipment to reset the shove's normal cooldown, allowing for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93IOL_pYkp4">several punches per second<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. When the bug was fixed, a fatigue meter was also added where shoves would gradually get alonger and longer cooldown.
</li><li> <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> adds an achievement for defeating a tank without the use of ranged/thrown weapons. Yes, this means beating the tank to death with melee attacks.
</li><li> Nothing quite compares to the satisfaction of finishing off a weakened survivor with a slap from the weak and fragile Boomer.
</li><li> There's also the "Akimbo Assassin" achievement, which is gained completing an entire campaign using only your pistols.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem">Duke Nukem</a></em>'s Mighty Foot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em>. Also, there were a couple of weapons, like the shrink gun, and the freeze ray, that allowed you to perform the coupe de grace with the aforementioned mighty foot.
</li><li> The Telekinesis plasmid from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock">BioShock</a></em> series lets you throw practically anything and do damage (indicated by blood spurting from your foes). This includes the pitifully weak HP restorative item Potato Chips.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune">Rune</a></em> you could cut off an adversary's arm and use it as a weapon against him. You could also pick up the heads of decapitated enemies and throw them at other enemies for small amounts of damage.
</li><li> Online freeware FPS/RTS crossover <em>Tremulous</em>, in which players play on either a human or alien team, has a couple of these. On the human side, all classes have the blaster, an <em>extremely</em> weak weapon with infinite ammo, intended as a backup. That doesn't stop people from trying- and succeeding- to get kills with it. On the alien side, the Granger, the builder class, has a melee attack, like all other classes, but by far the weakest out of all of them- and then there's the ranged Spit attack, which does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">crippling</a> 4 damage. Given the long repeat time, you'll probably be dead long before doing anything critical. Good luck!
</li><li> Flash Grenades in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Conduit2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Conduit2">Conduit 2</a></em> deal a small amount of damage to anyone close enough to the blast. It is possible to kill a player this way.
</li><li> In the FPS/RTS hybrid <em>Natural Selection</em>, the human space marines may purchase/be given a welder that is mainly used to repair the armor of teammates, or base structures. However, it replaces your melee weapon and does pitiful damage, but can still be used to kill an alien opponent with very low health.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesVikingsAndKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesVikingsAndKnights">Pirates Vikings and Knights</a></em>, kicking is primarily meant to knock enemies back, but it's entirely possible to kill someone as long as they're on low health.
<ul><li> It's also possible to kill someone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowABarrelAtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowABarrelAtIt">throwing a powderkeg at them.</a>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Skirmisher:</strong> <em>(disappointed)</em> Why'd I bother lightin' that?
</div><ul><li> And of course the Man-at-Arms' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fartillery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fartillery">fart Special</a> can gas enemies to death.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em>, Mei can do this. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">freezes</a> you in place, then she can finish you with a punch, or an icicle from her gun. Or her teammates finish you while she's regenerating in her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing">ice cube</a>.
<ul><li> Winston's main source of damage comes from his lightning spewing tesla cannon and massive fists, but by leaping with his Jump Pack ability he can also do a small amount of impact damage should he land on, or very close to, an enemy. Find someone with low enough health and it's death by monkey butt.
</li><li> D.Va's Recall Mech ability allowed her to gain her mech back, but also deals a tiny amount of damage in a very small space in front of her. Dying to it is possibly the most humiliating thing in the game
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixSiege">Rainbow Six Siege</a></em>, killing someone with a grenade or C4 is commonplace. Killing someone by chucking the grenade or C4 at their <em>heads</em> is this trope.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hexen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hexen">Hexen</a></em> it's perfectly possible for the mage to kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Heresiarch</a> using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">sapphire wand</a>, as it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">goes right through his invulnerabilty spell.</a> he has 5000 hp, however, and the wand only does 2-16 damage, so it will take ~30 min to kill one this way.

<ul><li> There is an entire collection of videos for the Xbox remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em>, demonstrating defeat of the game's single-battle (one of them aside) missions using the Wooden Sword, which is the weakest weapon that can actually hurt all enemies.
<ul><li> Also <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvg8OdIsndc">this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of someone killing an enemy by doing nothing but juggling him with shurikens, which is the REAL most weakest weapon in the game. It can't damage bosses or certain enemies, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> deserves mention for the sheer thud and manly scream that comes with Isaac's curb stomp attack, which can only be performed on enemies who are already knocked down on the floor.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> also has an achievement/trophy for beating the game using only the Plasma Cutter, the first weapon picked up during play.
<ul><li> Which is actually quite doable; it's a very, very effective gun.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em> gives you a bonus spell if you defeat the secret boss Gergoth using the Blank Book, Charlotte's weakest weapon. It's not that hard since you have to <em>finish</em> him with the book, so if you count down his HP until he has just enough to survive one more hit, it's easy.
</li><li> Portrait of Ruin has 2 joke weapons - the paper airplane and the cream pie. Anything can be cherry tapped by hitting them enough times, but special mention must go to the memory of Richter Belmont. The pie happens to inflict dark elemental damage, which is Richter's sole weakness. This along with granting momentarily stun means the cream pie is one of the more effective weapons to cheese him with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> has a move for Alucard, the Drop Kick, which essentially mimics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBrothers">Mario's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">"jump on something's head to kill it"</a> trick. And it lets you repeat said move <em>infinitely.</em> Can you guess how Dracula got killed after he turned into a "nightmarish" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>? I knew you could.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDawnOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDawnOfSorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a></em> introduces an ability that makes the Drop Kick even better: Medusa Soul. It lets you stay perfectly still in the air for as long as Soma's MP holds out. The Drop Kick's damage is based on airtime in this game, and Medusa Soul can be used within its animation. As a result, it's possible to begin the kick, then hold the Medusa Soul for a very long time before finally descending in a glorious, insanely damaging impact on whatever the poor thing is right under you.
</li><li> The prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></em> had a Medusa Soul as well that worked the same way, but the kick didn't gain any extra strength with longer airtime.
</li><li> If you're going for uses of the kick, <em>Aria Of Sorrow</em> has the best example of cherry tapping you can get. Remember Julius Belmont? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>? Wanna know how to totally punk him, possibly without getting hit? Kick him in the face. He'll always recoil and fly back long enough for you to jump up and do it again until the battle's over.
</li><li> That's nothing. Remember the Iron Golem? The monster with 9999 health, resistance to everything and literally INFINITE defense? Remember how you're supposed to kill him by switching his HP and MP values with that lame 'magic handkerchief'? Some people didn't have that the first time they saw the Iron Golem; and because everything hits an Iron Golem for 1 damage anyway (yes, even criticals) YOU KICK AN IRON GOLEM 9999 TIMES.
</li><li> <em>Symphony</em> also has the fist weapons, or just plain ol' punching unarmed. They can hit literally as fast as you can mash the attack key (with the exception of the Blue Knuckle, which is kind of crap) and have an <em>insane</em> crit chance, offsetting their very short range. So you can, quite literally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">Punch Out Cthulhu</a>. Or, you know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a>. Or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">The Big Man Himself</a>!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> features a wide variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">Joke Weapons</a>, as it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> game set in a shopping mall ripe with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">Improvised Weapons</a>. Some are much less effective than others, but it is still possible to kill zombies with stuffed teddy bears, ping-pong ball launchers, frisbees, and coat hangers.
<ul><li> However, one joke weapon can actually be used effectively in a boss battle against a human sniper. By using a hockey stick to shoot pucks, the hero can shoot the sniper from cover (as only the stick is not covered) and literally <em>beat the sniper into submission with hockey pucks</em>.
</li><li> To be fair, hockey pucks have gotta hurt, or hockey players wouldn't wear so much protection.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">extensive remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Mega Man</a></em>, defeating a Robot Master using only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">Mega Buster</a> unlocks him as a secret character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>, Link must battle the otherwise-invulnerable dark wizard Agahnim by reflecting his own magic back at him, using the legendary Master Sword (which you spend the entire game up until that point trying to acquire). Turns out that the Bug-Catching Net that a kid in Kakariko Village lets you play with accomplishes the feat just as well.
<ul><li> In <em>A Link to the Past</em>, there are two upgrades to the Master Sword that increase its damage. You can beat the game while avoiding both upgrades, but the un-tempered Master Sword is so weak that it cannot hurt the final boss without charging the sword and using the spin attack.
</li><li> A similar example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>: To make Ganondorf vulnerable to attack, first you must reflect his magic attacks back at him. This can be done with the Master Sword...or an empty bottle.
<ul><li> Using the bottle is actually <em>easier</em> in some ways than reflecting the attacks with a sword &mdash; it takes more reflections to finally break his guard, but the window on the bottle swing is much wider, meaning that it becomes much, much easier to time the attack. The bottle also has a faster swing.
</li></ul></li><li> The bottle also works against Phantom Ganon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>.
</li><li> You think the Empty Bottle trick is Cherry Tapping? You can beat Ganon (<em>Ocarina of Time</em>) with <em>Deku Nuts</em>. That's right - you can kill Ganondorf by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">hitting him with your nuts</a>. You could probably get to the end of the fight's second phase if you had a bigger carrying capacity for them.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, the battle is scripted so that the strike that takes him down HAS to be the Master Sword; try beating him with the Biggoron's Sword, and it may go on for nearly a half hour. One swing with the Master Sword, and he's ready for the killing face stab.

Difficult to do, as there aren't enough bottles in the vicinity to do even noticeable damage to him.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodHand">God Hand</a></em>, if you land enough hits on an enemy without taking any yourself, they go dizzy and you can use a special attack on them. Usually this is one of four - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs">Pummel</a>, Stinger (on fat enemies), Cobra Twist (on skinny enemies) or Spank (on female enemies) - but if they're down to the absolute last sliver of life (so that it doesn't even show in their life bar), the attack becomes "Poke of God"... which sees Gene simply push them over with one finger. This attack is most impressive when used against the game's demon opponents, who literally explode into dust when they die.
</li><li> In Chapter 13 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em>, Captain Walker is confronted by a mob of angry civilians.

Your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a> is disabled in this segment, meaning that moving forward enough times without killing or dispersing the crowd will result in Walker literally being shoved to death.

The awesome part is that <em>this works pretty well</em> when fighting opponents one-on-one; sure, Altair can't block, but your opponents can't counter or parry your fists, making it entirely possible for you to literally pummel your assassination targets to death.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> you can use a <em>broom</em> as a weapon, which works and even sounds just like a war hammer. There's even an achievement for it.
</li><li> You can also kill the last boss In <em>Assassin's Creed II</em> by kicking him in the shins over and over again, and he is powerless to stop you.

At the end of the very first level, you meet a gargoyle blocking a bridge you must cross. So you fetch the first thing that could come in handy, which is a frying pan. As anyone would expect, using a frying pan against a stone gargoyle is like putting out a forest fire with a water gun. The gargoyle knows this and starts laughing, and he laughs so much that he eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">loses his grip</a> and falls off the bridge. All because of a frying pan (which becomes Conker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">primary weapon</a> from then on - except when the situation demands otherwise).

Everything he throws does damage- so you can knock down buildings or kill bosses by throwing <em>pedestrians</em> at them. That's gotta hurt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodRayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodRayne">BloodRayne</a> 2</em> 's Harpoon does very little damage in and of itself, and you would normally use the move while in slow motion, in order to set up multiple plummeting kills for maximum "Carnage" (the game's equivalent of a "Rage" mechanic). Sometimes the opponent was just that weak that a single shot with the harpoon would kill them, causing them to simply fall while the harpoon was rapidly retrieved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondOasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondOasis">Beyond Oasis</a></em> had the Alt. Knife, the unbreakable side-weapon you are given at the beginning of the game, which could be used in lieu of other, better (but typically breakable) weapons you are given. It's the weakest weapon in the game, and its only real benefit is its special attacks, which can be fairly difficult to perform regularly, and for getting the unbreakable versions of stronger weapons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em>, the player is given a large variety of weapons, including an M-16, an M-9 Grenade Launcher and, finally, to make you wonder what it was for - a Taser. The Taser could be considered the Cherry Tapper, as it didn't actually damage them, just made them shake in place... unless you held the button down. In which case, the enemy eventually just caught on fire from the sheer amount of volts being pumped into them. Still a humiliating way to go.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Using a wand or a staff or other melee weapons as a Necromancer or Sorceress.
</li><li> The <em>Telekinesis</em> spell, particularly in <em>Diablo I</em>, is the ultimate way to cherry tap your enemies.
</li><li> The Sorceress does have access to a spell that adds substantial fire damage to any ranged or melee weapon, potentially turning any weapon (or even her bare fists) into a harbinger of fiery doom. Likewise, the Necromancer, when equipped with any dagger, can perform a special stab that causes incredible poison damage over time.
</li><li> A very obscure Barbarian build for PvP is based around using a poison damage buffing wand in each hand along with an AoE Whirlwind attack and an inventory completely full of powerful poison damage charms. The result is slaying other well-equipped players while holding what looks like two venomous forks.
</li><li> One forum member at the inc.gamers <em>Diablo 2</em> fan site tried to make a Boxer build with the Barbarian class, aka no weapon at all. Punching always does 1-2 damage in-game, so he had to rely on percentage-reduction damage bonuses. Needless to say it was very item-dependent and, as he admitted, very boring due to how repetitive it got.
</li><li> In the spirit of the trope, though, one player tried to play through the game using nothing but the Sorceress' weakest, most basic spell.
</li><li> The Amazon, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> 2</em>, is said to be able to beat Diablo with a broken short bow on Hell difficulty.
</li><li> And the Druid can have his ravens peck the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to death. It only takes about 30 minutes of realtime for Normal difficulty...
</li></ul></li><li> Try to beat the end boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> by using the blaster. Then the flamethrower. Then the bomb glove. Then the suck cannon on the final stage. You even get a bunch of suckable enemies, just in case you're out of ammo.
<ul><li> Later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> games award skill points for beating various levels or bosses using only your wrench.

</li></ul></li><li> Actually the best way to win the final boss battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a></em>. The programmers apparently didn't expect anyone to sheath their weapons and pummel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sosa</a> with their bare hands, and he reacts by standing there passively until he's dead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em>, you can take down the Splitworm with the knife.
</li><li> How about the dildo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>? No, wait, it gets even worse: you can beat people to death even with a goddamn <em>flower bouquet</em>. Yep.
<ul><li> The best part is that all of these weapons are obscenely powerful, killing any non-boss in three hits!
</li></ul></li><li> Broken weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WayOfTheSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WayOfTheSamurai">Way of the Samurai</a></em> do negligible damage (except on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Instant Kill difficulty</a>). The third game has 2 achievements for defeating enemies with broken weapons.
<ul><li> Throws and kicks actually do a flat rate of 10 damage (in the third game, at least), regardless of what difficulty you're on (yes, even Instant Kill).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> you can kick, which is the weakest attack in the game (but it has its own button!). But the satisfaction of killing a dragon by just relentlessly kicking at it's feet is just... Incomparable (and it's also just horrendously funny). <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwautVeV5RE">Observe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> From <em>Monster Hunter Dos</em> and onwards, there's a gesture that makes your character start <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowboxing">shadowboxing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the punches it does are <em>even weaker</em> than the kick (1 damage, the kick does 2), and yet, with really crazy careful planification (or cheating) you can still kill a gigantic dragon by punching his tail.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunterWorld">Monster Hunter: World</a></em> continues the tradition with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Hadoken and Shoryuken</a> gestures. Though admittedly it looks a <em>lot</em> more badass when you do it.
</li></ul></li><li> In all of the games, throwing a paintball or stone at a monster will also deal a measly one HP of damage to them (Five instead if you have a certain skill equipped).
</li><li> In the same vein as paintballs and stones, it is possible to kill a monster, particularly one you're supposed to capture instead of kill, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">with a Tranq Bomb</a>.
</li><li> Though not quite as extreme as the previous examples, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8k7jv5P27E">this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em>Monster Hunter Tri</em> shows Cha Cha, a very weak computer-controlled sidekick who's only meant to provide minor support for the player, killing the Great Jaggi <em>on his own.</em> Though granted, this is very dependent on Cha Cha wearing the False Felyne mask, as it would otherwise take much longer.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Manhunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Manhunt">Manhunt</a> 2</em>, there are a variety of small objects you can pick up and throw to distract enemies. However they can also do miniscule amounts of damage to anybody they hit. It is entirely possible to kill an enemy just by repeatedly throwing an empty soda can at him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade">Infinity Blade</a></em>, defeating the God King with Ruin, the weakest weapon in the game (attack power: <em>1</em>) unlocks the "Insult to Injury" Achievement.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>, the Idol Transformation ability can only be used successfully on a foe that is just shy of death... but if they are, you take out the foe, and you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">their statue</a> without having to play the Idol Toss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame">Mini-Game</a>.
<ul><li> The fourth boss of the game is the Great Reaper. You can shoot him in the chest and head until his forehead splits open, at which point you can deal the finishing blow. Or, you can just pummel his feet until he falls to the floor (did we mention he's three stories tall?) with his untouched head inexplicably split open. Palutena lists it as an option, and Pit explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">Stubbing your toe hurts a lot</a>.
</li><li> Some weapons have extraordinarily weak melee (Flintlock Staff, for example, is exclusively a ranged weapon), and you probably won't use a weapon with weak melee that still has stats in melee attacks. Good idea in multiplayer, the single player, however, has a couple enemies that can only be taken out by melee or it's just a better idea to use melee, at which point you're either cherry tapping them for a long time before they die, or just shooting them and dealing with the consequences.
</li><li> Heavenly Light seems to be made solely for cherry tapping anyone near you. You can also deal minimal damage with Super Speed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">Angelic Missile</a>.s

You're fighting an omnipotent god who storywise and gameplay wise is even stronger than the previous game's final boss, who had to be killed by <em>punching them into the sun</em>. The twist is, after a long, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> battle involving giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorBattlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorBattlefield">flashy arenas</a>, giant satellites, giant lasers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">giant satellites firing giant lasers</a>, in the end you end up weakening and depowering the boss so much, that after you send them flying through the air with your final attack (canonically stronger than the one in the first game), they keep going until they fall into the mouth of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Gommorah</a>.... the weakest summon in the first game, and the first boss of the sequel.

Maybe 10, if you get a critical hit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, you are literally invincible during the final battle. This gives you plenty of opportunity to, if you have time to kill, hack the Big Bad apart with the most pathetic weapons, characters and techniques in your arsenal &mdash; and you don't even have to do that either: You can sit back and let the boss whittle his own health away with percentage-based attacks that affect everyone including himself, and land the finishing blow when his attacks stop damaging him.
<ul><li> Also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> is Evrae Altana, who is inflicted with Zombie status. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">Throw some healing items at it and it's gone</a>.
<ul><li> There are several such enemies - often bosses - in the series.

</li></ul></li><li> You can do a " No Sphere Grid Play through". Basically you keep your characters at <em>level 1</em>, and yes, people have finished the game this way.
</li><li> When you have an enemy down to single-digit HP, you're <em>supposed</em> to hit them with your most powerful attack and go for the Overkill. Still, it's much more fun to have Yuna or Lulu finish them off. Especially Lulu, with her dolls. Seeing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Malboro</a> go down at the hands of a Moogle is not something easily forgotten.
</li><li> It gets worse when you consider that the first weapon you get with Deathstrike is Lulu's Fatal Cait Sith.
</li><li> The best thing is giving one of Lulu's dolls Death Strike and Counter Attack. She will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> enemies with a backhanded slap!

However it's kind of hilarious to see Yukari do a critical hit on a strong enemy with her bow.

</li><li> Try beating the entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> using the Buster Sword. Okay, no problem? Now beat the Sephiroth at the end <em>without</em> using the limit break.
<ul><li> Then there's killing Ruby Weapon, the second-strongest enemy in the entire game, with a level one character. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJWPI5Ticwc">Like this.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> You actually have the option in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> to not be equipped with a weapon and fight with your bare hands, which makes it more gratifying when you return to early parts of the game after leveling up and punching enemies to death.
<ul><li> Killing enemies with bare hands is all well and good (high combo chance and all of that), but what is truly humiliating is getting killed by a Measure, a weapon so weak that it will actually buff the target, and it deals pathetic damage, even for an armor-piercing weapon. Ending the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> through this method makes the scene after totally worth it, even at max stats.
<ul><li> Measures aren't supposed to be used as offensive weapons in the first place... you're supposed to use them to buff your own party for free.
</li><li> If you think beating enemies with measures is pathetic enough, try beating a boss by <em>throwing rocks at it</em>, aka Knots of Rust. This item also appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The job system recurrent in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series can allow for particularly fun humiliation. For example&mdash;it is not exceptionally difficult to beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> using a party of Dancers, and !Dance as their only offensive move. It is, in fact...a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">cakewalk</a>.
<ul><li> In fact, you can beat FF V in level 2~4 characters. The boss fights do not give you any EXP(In the original Japanese SFC version), and you only get a handful of fights that give you EXP that you cannot escape from. The game is designed so that you can beat most boss quite easily if you have the right combination of abilities and items. You do need to temporarily boost your level with the Chemist skill in a fight(where your characters get to lv 80 or so in that fight) and a boss you need to toss a staff and you get about 1/6 chance of a one hit kill.(You can farm for the loot beforehand) You can do similar in FF VI in level 7~12 characters.
</li></ul></li><li> In a rare example by a computer-controlled character, the Nu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> has two head-butts: one head-butt reduces the target's HP to 1, regardless of how much HP the target has, and the other head-butt <em>does</em> 1 HP of damage.
<ul><li> And yes, the 'you now have one hitpoint' attack does 0 if you're already at one hit point. The fact that you can find that out quite readily (he's not terribly smart about exploiting his two hit kill combo) makes it worse when he DOES manage to kill someone. Especially if you stopped healing yourself thinking it was a waste of effort...
</li><li> If you've gotten every ending, done the 9999 point damage strike without using Ayla, had multiple suits of the best stuff for every character and enough tabs to max out all your character's stats except evade, and went back and played through all the game's variants (e.g. killing/not killing magus), you still haven't beaten <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. You haven't done that until you've beaten Lavos with a mop. No techniques except "confuse" your first time, no direct damage except the attack command afterward. Cherry tapping Lavos has to be the entire reason the mop was included in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> players like to slay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss">Anti-Climax Boss</a> Vlad the Impaler, with an oddball object such as a thoroughly rusted tin opener which they then name "Vladsbane".
<ul><li> Meanwhile, some classic tales of silliness from the roguelike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband">Angband</a></em> include The Shoveller, named for fighting monsters only with a tool intended for clearing rubble, and the Bookless Mage, whose weapon of choice was a thrown spellbook.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>, many of the quests which unlock advanced jobs require the party to engage in some type of Cherry Tapping (i.e. kill 3 Hocus Chimeras ONLY by poisoning them and letting them die from it, wait until full Tension then kill a Slime, etc)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, a special title can be gained if Lloyd goes through roughly a third of the game wielding only the wooden swords he starts the game with.
<ul><li> Defeating Abyssion using the poison Pow-Hammer strategy. Basically it involves a physically weak character defeating the game's toughest optional boss by throwing a rubber hammer at him, waiting a few minutes, and then hitting him once(a total of two hits for a boss with hundreds of thousands of HP). You can continue to attack after the hammer affects him but it's more fun to just watch.
<ul><li> Beating Magnadeus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Tales of Destiny</a> 2</em> using the little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> is similar, although there are no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> involved. You just have to keep attacking... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">A lot</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A multitude of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> games have the Minimum Damage skill, which makes you only deal one HP of damage with all of your attacks. It's mostly meant for practicing combos, but whatever you decide to use as a target dummy is going to go down eventually.
</li><li> Wiegraf, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>, can be defeated by spending turn after turn evading him and using temporary stat-boost moves to bring up the speed and strength stats to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">insane</a> levels, then ending the fight by one-shotting him with...a thrown book.
<ul><li> Also fun: Beating down any of the bosses to single digit hit points, then killing him via thrown-rock-to-the-face.
</li><li> Or better yet, don't get them down that low and beat them with a dash. Off a cliff. Only works on some levels, though.
<ul><li> Even funnier: hit an enemy with a thrown rock just to make him move one space and fall of the cliff.
</li></ul></li><li> Finishing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Argath</span> off with a crossbow. Sure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">swords</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">fireballs</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade">Holy</a> are all perfectly usable substitutes, but killing the bastard with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the same type of weapon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">he used to kill Tietra</a></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">is</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">much</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">more satisfying</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, it's more than possible to beat up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> Carpainter without ever launching a single attack &mdash; the player is given the Franklin Badge shortly beforehand, which reflects his most powerful attack back at him, and indeed is required to fight him at all. Hence, with a little bit of level grinding and maybe the occasional healing spell, the player can simply sit back and wait for him to kill himself. And there's really nothing more spiteful than that.
<ul><li> Except, of course, using PSI Paralysis on Mondo Mole (which he will <em>never</em> recover from) and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Paula</a> beat him to death.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPdwIpvsv-8&amp;feature=related">F.E.A.R.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> definitely counts. Watching a Level 1 Rattata decimating a Level 100 anything brings laughs to you and humiliation to your foes. In addition, any examples below that involves using a particular move is not only a direct example of this trope, it's an indirect one as well: As a Pok&eacute;mon can only know 4 moves at a time, in order to engage in that sort of cherry tapping, they had to set aside one of those four moves solely for that one thing. In other words, the cherry-tapping Pok&eacute;mon is using only 3 moves compared to the opponent's 4.
<ul><li> Also Shedinja, who has the dubious honor of being the only Pok&eacute;mon weaker that the one it evolves from (strictly speaking), but, thanks to the fact that it cannot be harmed by attacks that are not super effective, it can stand up to some game-breakers such as Kyogre or Palkia, who usually cannot hit it despite being behemoths in their own right.
<ul><li> Perhaps the most humiliating thing you can do to someone in Pok&eacute;mon is taking them out with a final gambit by Shedinja. Final Gambit is a move that faints the user and deals damage to the opponent equal to the HP the user had. Shedinja only has <em>one</em> measly little hitpoint. To be KO'd by Shedinja's final gambit is incredibly embarrassing.
</li></ul></li><li> In general this can apply to anyone in the competitive online Pok&eacute;mon battling scene who uses Pokemon from the Neverused-or-under tiers in a Standard (or worse, Uber) tier battle for the purpose of humiliating an opponent that is presumably using entirely Overused Pok&eacute;mon.
<ul><li> Or not fully evolved? For example, a Hypnosis Yanma trained for Speed. You've never seen someone swear so loud as when they get stomped by a little red bug.
</li><li> Bibarel can knock out the likes of Uber teams, especially those that run multiple Arceus/Mewtwo/Deoxys teams. The laughs are amazing, and humiliations abound. Utilize Neverused Pok&eacute;mon sparingly if you want to keep your competitive friends.
</li><li> Of course, this is mostly because of the ability Moody, which is now banned in competitive communities due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">overpowered</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">based on luck over skill.</a>
</li><li> So you think getting epically owned by a Bibarel is bad? How about having a team of ubers and legendaries beaten by a team of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3uROelepGY">Bidoof<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>?

</li><li> Managing to defeat somebody with Constrict is definitely humiliating. Why? Because Constrict has a whopping <em>10</em> base damage.
</li><li> The AI certain computer-controlled opponents tends to do this as well; if your Pokemon is low on HP, they'll attack with the weakest move in their moveset.
</li><li> In Black and White, it's possible to defeat Cynthia&mdash;the champion of Sinnoh&mdash;with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkVT1KjojCk">a team of level 1 Pokemon.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

</li><li> Invoked with the attack Fell Stinger. It has a measly base power of 30 (Tackle was stronger than that <em>before</em> it was buffed), but if the attack successfully knocks out an opponent, the user's Attack doubles.
</li><li> This trope is actually referenced in a trailer for for <em>Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</em>. After blocking several attacks, Mega Sableye gets crushed under the weight of its own gem when Mega Lopunny jumps over and taps it in the shin.

Or, as he put it, they played a game called <a class="urllink" href="http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/KOTOR%202/Update%2053/index.html">Punch The Sith Lord<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. (Scroll down towards the end)
<ul><li> Then again, considering that you deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">almost as much damage bare-handed as you can do with a lightsaber....</a>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>, if you have your character learn about hitting targets critically, you can eventually make anything die by hitting it in juuuust the right spot. There are a few situations in which you'd want to kill a creature without actually damaging it, and so it's useful to carry around the weapon equivalent of dandelions to hurl at people's eyes.
</li><li> The Rock-it! Launcher of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> can use any type of Junk as ammunition. That means you can kill a Super Mutant Behemoth with any type of Junk.

<ul><li> Keep in mind that it magically increases the damage of said teddy bear to levels close to that of an assault rifle. The <em>real</em> Cherry Tapping is the BB gun. This is the weakest weapon in the game, by far. If you had a BB gun in perfect condition (really hard to get), and happen to have maxed small weapons skill, <em>it would take 500 shots to kill a Super Mutant Behemoth. And it is pump action.</em> In comparison, the Launcher would only take 40 teddies.

<ul><li> There's the Needle of Eternal Agony which is a total pain in the ass to get (you got to defeat the one boss maneater, which turns out to be 2 bosses) and only deals 10 physical damage per hit, making it completely useless for such a hard game, but extremely funny to brag about in PvP.
</li><li> It seems you can <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Gnwe2BkUI">beat the game in level 1<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

He is therefore all but useless, unless you manage to get an enemy down to 1HP. (There is even a trophy/achievement for doing this.)
<ul><li> Of course, it's a lot easier when you find out the fact that it has an instant kill move, and you can get the achievement doing that. Granted, this attack activates around 2% of the time, IF that much, but it's certainly a sight to see when it happens.

It has no attack, defense, or magic bonuses, but it has a finisher, and that's all you need. Just for added humiliation, the sound and visual effects makes it seem like you're beating down an entity of nothingness using a stick with an adorable honeycomb inside. It's death by cute at its finest.
</li><li> In <em>Birth by Sleep</em>, there is a rather difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> that can have his A.I broken in a hilarious way. If you hide behind a rock on the stage, the boss's A.I will try to hit you through the rock. To easily defeat him,simply stand behind the rock and spam Strike Raid or one of its variants, some of the weakest and earliest obtained commands in the whole game.
</li><li> Also in <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>: during the boss battle against Luxord, he can turn you into a die or a playing card. As demonstrated <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ohELKTnRbI">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it's entirely possible to defeat him by <em>tackling him to death as a die</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">It's a pretty entertaining challenge to go through as much of game</a> in <em>KH II</em> with only the abilities you had equipped to Roxas. Difficult but it feels good beating the final boss only using your starting combos.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em>, Sora's Slide Roll ability is meant to be used defensively, but for some awkward reason, causes a fixed one HP of damage to anything you roll into. As bosses can't be defeated by your party members and instead remain at one HP, using an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryCombatRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryCombatRoll">Unnecessary Combat Roll</a> to finish them off is easily possible.
</li><li> Another self-imposed challenge is to use the "EXP Zero" ability that appears in several games. If the player equips it at the beginning of the game, they will gain no experience from fighting and remain at level 1. Not only does it prevent you from increasing your stats, it also makes several vital spells and abilities unattainable.
</li><li> Very minimal damage can be done using the vertical and horizontal spin flowmotions without using a flowmotion attacks. And it can kill.
</li><li> Bosses have limits on how much damage can be done with single attacks, causing powerful single attack commands to be extremely weak on anything but standard enemies. Anybody that doesn't know this will probably assume a boss has a lot of health and beat them using Meteor and Mega Flare anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> The AI in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FossilFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FossilFighters">Fossil Fighters</a></em> will always use a vivosaur's most basic attack to take one of your vivosaurs down when its HP is low enough.
</li><li> Using your weakest weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Grandia1">Grandia</a></em> actually gives you better experience (more hits, more exp) than just using your strongest ones and finishing the enemy in one blow.
</li><li> It is quite possible and was popular when it was new among "extreme" gamers to beat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable</a></em> and its expansion pack <em>Fable: The Lost Chapters</em> using no healing items or magic and no other weapons or armor than the Apprentice Robes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">wooden stick</a> you get at the start of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> rewards you for cherry tapping with the very low-power spell <em>Lucky Shot</em> which, if it kills the enemy, grants even the rarest of enemy drops.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> multiplayer it's frustratingly easy for basic mooks like the Cerberus Assault Trooper to land a downing hit and then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingStomp">Finishing Stomp</a>.
<ul><li> On the other hand, as an asari, a common tactic is to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">stasis</a> before headshooting an enemy. But one of the ultimate evolutions of this power is a bubble. On some maps (like Firebase White), you can throw your bubble just over the landing point of the troopers, and watch as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">fall to their deaths</a> before setting a foot on the ground, killing them with your only power that doesn't deal any damage.
</li></ul></li><li> in a non gameplay element it is possible to kill a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubbleBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubbleBoy">quarian</a> by simply removing their helmet and coughing on them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCowl">Garrus</a> does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">this to one who had turned virus maker on Omega.</a>

In fact, it may be necessary due to the game's frustrating item-breaking system.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, hitting a Mechon with a physical attack from a weapon that lacks the ability to pierce their armor will deal only one point of damage (Unless they're toppled). It's entirely possible to finish them off in this fashion.
<ul><li> You also deal with a few humanoid enemies who are similarly resistant to the Monado, only they <em>always</em> take one damage from it, regardless of whether they're toppled or not.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> you can totally do stuff like this to both Bosses and other players. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">Whip</a> builds are the most popular and amusing just because of how much the two available whips suck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastStory">The Last Story</a></em> has bosses that must be taken down in a way more similar to an action game by putting it in a weakened state or expose its weakpoint in some way. Or, you can just attack it head on, dealing minimal damage but relying on chains to deal more damage anyway, and diffusing healing circles as they come to keep your party alive.

Every successful hit, regardless of how much damage it does, counts the same towards increasing that skill. Stabbing something 100 times with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">Fork of Horripilation</a> will lead to a greater increase of your short blade skill than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">one-shotting</a> that same foe with a Daedric dagger. Inversely, this works on you to level up your armor skills. Simply deck yourself out in a full suit of armor, find a rat, and allow said rat to cherry tap YOU. Each hit will count towards increasing the armor skill for the type of armor you are wearing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the <em>Hearthfire</em> DLC gives you opportunities for this. You can pick up a low-damage table knife or fork (or <em>both</em> and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">dual wield</a> them) or fight with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenKatanasAreEvenBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenKatanasAreEvenBetter">wooden sword</a> intended to be used as a gift for your children.

Bonus points for killing her because it nearly always results in an unarmed finishing move, resulting in the hilarious potential sight of a tiny Breton mage suddenly killing an old woman (possibly mid-speech) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlerInAllOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlerInAllOfUs">with a body slam or a German suplex</a>.
</li><li> In the 'Dawnguard' DLC the player must defeat the seconds antagonist on a balcony. It's meant to be a climactic battle against a formidable opponent &#151; in reality, the duel can be finished in seconds by using the Unrelenting Force shout to knock him off of the balcony.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em> killing anything in a swarm of noobships (the basic free ship that everyone gets in the beginning or after loosing his ship and docking up) can be considered a cherrytap. On a more experienced level, corps such as Goon swarm used cheap tech I ships to destroy superior (and much more expensive) tech II ships.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> (and Villains), every player character has an attack power called Brawl. It usually manifests as a simple punch or kick, and does only minor damage. Once your character has a decent number of real attack powers, it serves two functions: it's an efficient way to down an enemy with only a few hit points remaining, and somehow it just feels better to take down that annoying enemy by simply punching his lights out.
<ul><li> For some characters, like those using Bows or Dual Blades, the punch is replaced with a kick instead. It can be even more gratifying to finish off an archvillain/superhero with a solid kick to the groin.
</li><li> One invention-origin enhancement gives taunt powers a chance to do minor psionic damage, allowing characters to annoy people to death. Better yet, since all tanker taunts gain a short-range AoE, it's possible to kill an <em>entire mob</em> with a one-liner.
</li><li> Then there is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerofRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerofRock">Rock power</a> which can be obtained during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">the Halloween Event</a>.

</li><li> The game also allows for substantial after-market alteration to any class by way of optional generic powers; consequently, one can take a Controller archetype and outfit him or her for hardened brawling. The end-result - a 'Scraptroller' - is kind of like being beaten to death by Professor X.
</li><li> Enemies who slow your attack rates, while highly annoying, are more likely to be taken down this way simply because you start using cherry-tap attacks while your effective ones are still recharging. It makes for satisfying revenge.

However, a special mention goes to the Flower Bouquet which only has 1 ATP (attack power), 1 ATA (accuracy), no special ability and is literally a bouquet of flowers.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, using your melee weapon as a mage, priest or warlock (or alternatively for the warlock, using the imp or voidwalker). Wands are almost universally better for these classes <em>and</em> are ranged weapons. For Melee classes, utilizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">Fishing poles</a> or unequipping one's weapon achieves the same effect.
<ul><li> Arguably the closest thing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has to Cherry Tapping is the concept of low-manning, i.e. taking on raid bosses (encounters designed for large, coordinated groups of players) with an understrengthed raid party. This is sometimes taken to ridiculous extremes, either for profit (less people to share in the loot), or - more often - for bragging rights. Famous examples include a warlock and a paladin killing the dragon Onyxia (a boss originally designed for 40 players), a four-man group besting Gruul the Dragonkiller (made possible by cleverly manipulating the combat stats on a rogue so that the boss had <em>literally no chance of landing a hit</em>) and a very determined warlock solo-killing Hydross the Unstable (a 25-man boss).
<ul><li> actually, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has had some real Cherry Tap abilities. Particularly two classes: the paladin and the rogue. It's an old game though, so virtually every class at one point had a stupid gimmick power that was normally useless but occasionally overpowered. There have also been some items in this category. Some of the most famous in no particular order (not counting beta bugs either):
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>Reckoning-paladin. This ability allowed the paladin to do extra damage after getting critical hit. The gimmick was that it stacked infinitely. Inevitably, there was a paladin crazy enough to get critical hit repeatedly (backstabs were automatic critical hits at the time), and then go solo-kill a world boss.
Windfury-shaman. Shamans have the unique ability to put enchantments on their weapons, and Windfury was one of them. Each weapon strike had a chance to knock an opponent back. The thing was, the Windfury effect itself had a chance to cause Windfury. So shamans could put you in an infinite chain of knockbacks.
Cyclone-druid. It's a standard crowd control ability, except it can be used as transportation by the caster. At one point druids could use it to get into battlegrounds before they started. Since they also have stealth, this was a pain in the butt. Nowadays more esoteric methods are required to break into places players aren't allowed.
Lockpicking-rogue. Not a combat ability, but it's a kind of Cherry Tap because of how it allows this class to exploit the game's economy. There are random loot boxes in the game. Most of the time they have useless stuff in them. Occasionally they have extremely good raiding gear, otherwise unobtainable items, or even legendary items in them. Only rogues, and characters with the jewelcrafting profession, can open them. Everyone else can auction the boxes, but their prices are modest.
Spellsteal-mage. It's exactly what it sounds like: you can steal a spell that the enemy has cast on themselves. Some raid bosses have extremely powerful magical defenses. Occasionally Blizzard forgets to make them immune to spell-stealing. This is a chronically recurring problem. Most recently it is famous for causing an exploit in the Black Rook Hold dungeon (in combination with the ability listed below), used by serious Mythic+ dungeon running groups.
Enslave Undead-Death Knight. Again, exactly what it sounds like: you can mind-control an undead creature. While this doesn't apply to bosses, it can be used on elites and other mobs found it dungeons. Some of which are ridiculously strong, or automatically cast useful spells on their allies. Or can be exploited by another party member as in the Black Rook Hold dungeon where an undead mage can be enslaved by the party's tank and then have their buff taken off them by the party's mage.
Last Stand-paladin. Told you they were going to come up a lot. A talent that allows the paladin to absorb incoming damage, based on the number of enemies they are fighting. Only kind of a Cherry Tap because you can't kill anyone with it, and a protection spec paladin is not likely to kill anyone anyway, but in competitive pve it could be considered a Cherry Tap. The paladin essentially becomes invincible because the effect stacks infinitely: thus allowing them to stand for hours whittling down enemies.
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li> using wands is now considered Cherry Tapping, as they are generally useless in comparison to other weapons. However, with the right gear they can be very deadly. WoW's age also means that there's a lot of weirdly itemized gear, some of which can make certain underpowered weapons or abilities very good.
</li><li> Let's not forget the hunter <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_-_3tfmU-o">soloing Azuregos!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> With the onset of lvl 80 characters and items, this was no longer a big deal. 1-manning Onyxia was fairly commonplace, at least by certain hybrid classes - shaman, druid, warlock and paladin - who are capable of both melee power and self-healing (warlocks doing so using their pets).
</li><li> Hogger is a level 11 "Elite" (a creature who has more health, attack power and defense than a normal creature of the same level) very near the human starting area. A "Hogger Raid" is the lvl 1 equivalent of an end-boss raid by max-level characters. Hogger Raids tactics are generally limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> until he is dead. (And incidentally are stupidly fun/funny to participate in....) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHWyJT2QRMM">YouTube video here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (but some profanity over voice-chat). "I've got aggr&mdash;oh, never mind."
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a> version is using a priest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">Mind Control</a> an enemy player in a duel. They can't hurt themselves and you likely can't access and waste their cooldown abilities. But if you're in the right position, you can make them jump off a very high cliff.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4680055621031897025&amp;q=firestone">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> shows a Warlock (a casting class with virtually no melee power) using a Firestone-enhanced weapon to melee players to death in PvP. The Firestone was a Warlock-specific weapon enhancement that, aside from adding spell power, caused the Warlock's weapon to occasionally (frequently, in practice) hit the target for a burst of fire damage. A large burst of damage. Especially compared to the kind of melee damage a Warlock normally does. Unfortunately Firestones no longer exist.
</li><li> One of the most well-known PvP video series of pre-Burning Crusade WoW was World of Roguecraft, in which someone displayed how overpowered rogues were by defeating well-geared players while completely naked aside from the weakest weapon in the game by "stun-locking" them for the entire fight, thus preventing them from hitting him more than once or twice, and utilizing an attack that did the same damage regardless of what stat bonuses the rogue had from gear.
<ul><li> Stun-locking is still a major part of rogue PvP, but due to certain changes to stats and mechanics, it now takes some gear to pull off and the target has to be ungeared.
</li></ul></li><li> WoW also has a number of items that technically count as one-handed melee weapons such as large fish or mugs full of beer. They are not particularly useful as weapons, but imagine being defeated in PvP by someone wielding <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/22_Pound_Catfish">catfish...<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> RP walking (toggling off your character's default run mode so they walk slowly like an NPC) while in a PvP situation is a traditional way to imply a cherry tap, since speed and mobility are crucial in combat.
</li><li> It's possible to humiliate allies similarly. With dual talent specialization, raiding healers can have a separate spec for questing and 5-man dungeons. A geared priest can create either a Holy or Discipline secondary spec which takes talents and glyphs for Smite and Holy Nova, queue as healer for random Heroic dungeons, and pull respectable damage for a DPSer while keeping the group healed with ease. You're almost guaranteed to have at least one DPS who can't keep up. If the DPS is not freshly level-capped, humiliation ensues &mdash; often in the form of someone asking "Uh, why is the healer outdamaging you guys?"
<ul><li> You can pull off the inverse as a Retribution Paladin, a class who's main utility lies in it's ability to heal allies, if you outgear the healer enough, you can quite literally take over his role.
</li></ul></li><li> Naked fist-fights consist of well, two people dueling eachother with no gear whatsoever and just auto-attacking eachother to death.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> The Headshot skill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanDead">Urban Dead</a></em> applies whenever you give a killing blow, no matter what weapon was used. It has become an accomplishment to deliver your final strike with a simple Punch, both because it has the lowest hit chance and only does 1 damage, <em>and</em> the image of socking someone so hard that their head explodes is frickin' awesome.
<ul><li> This also applies to many other weapons and skills in the game. An update also allowed many other things to be used as weapons, so it's possible to kill people with gas cans, toolboxes, pool cues, pumpkins, <em>Christmas Trees</em> and even tinsel, as well as many other things. There are now entire groups built around kills with unusual weapons
</li><li> Through clever use of URL manipulation, it's possible to use the zombie skills Bite and Headbutt as a living survivor. This can lead to hilarity as human suvivors are seen <em>biting zombies/people to death</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The game of <em>Perihelion</em> included a turn-based combat system with action points and weapons doing like 30-120HP damage, that took either a fixed percent (30-70%) of AP or a fixed number, like 50 or 120AP. Finishing characters had about 120-200AP. But there was that one tiny puny knife to be found, that did puny damage but took only 2AP to hit. The end battle could be finished in two rounds with one character using only that knife, jabbing the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">UNBORN GOD</span> sewing machine style with it.
</li><li> There are videos of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em> players taking down Tz-Tok-Jad, one of the game's hardest bosses, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">rubber chicken</a>.
<ul><li> What makes this even funnier is that according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Tz-Tok-Jad is allergic to chickens.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nTXj-hVwY0">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> features a player single-handedly taking down Kree'arra (level 580) with a sling, the weakest ranged weapon in the game.
</li><li> The Duel Arena, where players fight each other in one-on-one battles, has an option that only allows the players to use silly weapons that give negative combat bonuses, like the aforementioned rubber chicken and flowers.
</li><li> There is an achievement for killing the Corporeal Beast (a boss even stronger than the Jad) wielding only a bronze spear. To make it easier, you can cheat by using dreadnips, poison, and jewelry with damaging effect, but you can&#146;t deploy a cannon. You also can get this achievement in a group but only if everyone in the group uses a bronze spear.
</li><li> You also get an achievement for killing General Graardor using your fists.
</li><li> What may be one of the most insane achievements in the game is for defeating Araxxor and Araxxi, one of the most difficult boss fights in the game, while wearing bronze armor and a bronze weapon.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em>, getting "wanded" in PvP is a humiliating form of defeat. Technically, a wand deals as much damage as a sword, but since there are no attack skills for wands, plinking away at someone's health with a wand (or a staff) is a vastly inefficient method of killing them, especially since every second spent wanding is one spent not casting spells (which are much more effective). Thus, dying to an enemy's wand or staff implies that you - and your team - are so completely incompetent that the opposing team doesn't even need to use skills to take you down.

</li><li> Both games have the Ancho-V Games stage, which feature propeller-powered platforms. Shooting at the propellers causes the platforms to move, and the ink will rebound off the propellers...and potentially splat an enemy if they have the unfortunate combination of being next to it and low on health.

This was particularly prevalent during initial playtesting, before all the rules were finalized. One story goes that, before the "only four of any card except basic lands" rule was instituted, one player loaded his deck with bunches of <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?id=2367">Swords to Plowshares<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=129626">Llanowar Elves<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Eventually, his opponent would be out of creatures and at a ridiculous life total. So in went the elves...60...59...58...57... Another story involves a character playing <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=135271">Lord of the Pit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> against a <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=129501">Clone<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> deck. The cloning player could die from it or Clone it...but had no way to pay for it...
<ul><li> The designers even slip in the occasional obviously terrible card <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr179">specifically to please the cherry-tappers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (scroll to "Issue # 2").
</li><li> Creatures that are unblockable could count as well, since the fact that they can't be blocked is usually balanced by giving the creature a low Power (rarely going higher than 2 without other effects to increase it). Creatures like <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220041">Invisible Stalker<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> especially, since they're difficult to remove on top of dealing almost-guaranteed damage.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> TCG deck called the "No Energy Stall." It contains a bunch of high-HP Pok&eacute;mon, healing Trainers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">no energy whatsoever</a> - which means you <em>can't use any attacks.</em> The point is to hold out as long as you can until the other player runs out of cards.
<ul><li> A similar deck is the Mulligan Mewtwo deck. 56 Psychic Energy, 4 Base Set Mewtwo, which have Barrier and Psychic. Odds are you won't get any starting Pokemon for your first few starting hands (you MUST draw a Basic Pokemon, or you reshuffle and draw a new hand), so your opponent might lay on the extra cards (they can draw 0, 1, or 2 each time you reshuffle) until s/he catches on. Once you get one, attach a Psychic energy each turn until you can use Barrier, then just keep using it until your opponent decks out, building up the other Mewtwo as a precaution for things like the old Gust of Wind.
</li></ul></li><li> Yata-Garasu lockdown did this for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. Basically the combo wipes the field and both players hands, except for the lone Yata Garasu left in the controlling player's hand. He can then play this and Yata forbid his opponent from drawing if the card causes any lifepoint damage. Yata only has 200 attack points (as opposed to the 8000 players start with), meaning the opponent will get cherry tapped to death as he does not have any cards in his hand, nor the ability to draw any more cards. Since Yata returns to the hand after the turn ends, this also means that cherry tapping will likely be the only viable way to finish the game (as you can only make one summon per turn, unless another card is used to bypass this).
<ul><li> What's even <em>more</em> of a Cherry Tapping is <em>countering</em> a Yata Garasu lockdown: play a deck focused on building life points and use as many of your cards' effects as possible before your enemy summons YG. If done properly, you can put your life points in the five-digit range before your opponent locks down, and then just sit back and watch your opponent run out of cards before you run out of life points. However, it will only work if the opponent has a completely clear field otherwise and no remaining means of Special Summoning, which is very unlikely unless you're playing against an utterly incompetent opponent.
</li><li> Sparks, a spell card that does a measly 200 points of damage to the opponent, has basically no use other than this. Some video game versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> give you a bonus if you can ever manage to successfully finish off the opponent with a Sparks card. Particularly nasty players have been known to take it further, using loops (for instance, Primal Seed/Banisher of the Radiance) to kill an opponent using <em>just</em> Sparks, played forty times in a row.
</li><li> Video games that provide a Sparks bonus also often give one for winning with Skull Servant, a Normal Monster infamous for having only 300 ATK - slightly more damage than Sparks, but only slightly. As Skull Servant is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a>, along with being possible to power up with things like equips, this is a fair bit more feasible.
</li><li> For a good while, there was "Cowboy For Game" - a term for summoning the easily-made Xyz Monster <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gagaga_Cowboy">Gagaga Cowboy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> whenever the opponent was on low LP, and then using its effect to deal 800 damage and end the game. Even after it stopped being as feasible, packing a monster with some kind of burn or direct-attack effect in the Extra Deck to finish off a limping opponent has become pretty popular.
</li><li> The Gravity Bind trap prevents all monsters level 4 and higher from attacking. For a time, a very efficient deck could be build around this trap and direct attack monsters, which are generally weak and low level.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AliensVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AliensVsPredator">Aliens vs. Predator</a></em> card game, it was entirely possible to weaken the fearsome Predator with a barrage from your heavily armed Colonial Marines, such that the final killing blow could come from a rescued pet cat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft">Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</a></em>, killing someone with something that deals one damage. Whether it's the Mage's Hero Power, a weak minion like Wisp or Murloc Tinyfin, or a 1 damage spell like Razorpetal or Frost Shock, it's pretty humiliating.
<ul><li> There's also a common practice of self-cherrytapping. When a player knows he's going to lose, he can get style points by using his cards to set up an elaborate suicide (perhaps by ridiculously overbuffing one of the enemy's minions, then attacking it).
</li><li> It's also possible to grind an opponent down to 1 health and then <em>keep them alive</em> while maintaining board control and making sure they can't wear down your health. Depending on how late you are in the game, you can keep this up until they run out of cards and lose.

</div><ul><li> The Baneblade superheavy tank is known for its heavy weapon loadout (and those are the lighter weapons on that tank). In <em>Codex: Astra Militarum</em>, the Hellhammer is a variant of the Baneblade, that's designed to kill enemies in hiding. Of all the weapons in the 40k universe, guess what's one of the unique built-in weapons for the Hellhammer is..., yup the humble lasgun - a weapon so puny that the optional storm bolter or heavy stubber that gets bolted on the turret hatch is far deadlier than it. They couldn't even get a hot-shot lasgun. That lasgun is only there to try and pick off a straggler that somehow survives everything else the Hellhammer throws at an enemy.

</li><li> In 6th edition, due to the vehicle damage table revamp and the introduction of the Hull Point system, the easiest way to kill anything short of a Land Raider or Monolith (which have the highest armor values possible) is to spam a lot of medium strength, high volume shots at it. The new Vehicle Damage Table doesn't contain any method for a Penetrating hit to kill a vehicle unless it had special modifiers (usually by AP or some other rule) but both Penetrating Hits and Glancing Hits will shave off a Hull Point, which will destroy the vehicle when they run out. Cue entire mechanized armies being cherry tapped to death by what is essentially a disco-light show (Multi-Lasers and Scatter Lasers)
</li><li> Anything with a 2+ armor save or an Invulerable save better equal to or better than 3+ will result in the opponent resorting to this; anti-tank weapons, the intended counter, don't fire enough shots to reliably kill anything with those saves (they either come in units or have ridiculous amount of wounds) so most people resort to the above disco light show to deal damage. After all, if you're already going to have a pisspoor chance at killing it with one shot, why not go with a few hundred slightly more pisspoor chances that also have a chance at wiping them out in one go?

In other cases, though, it's clearly someone with something to prove - for instance, a player who entered an "arena battles" challenge using a commoner and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimefightingWithCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimefightingWithCash">relying solely on buyable magic items.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Often a very valid tactic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, especially if you're using a fast mech armed with a long range energy weapon (energy weapons in <em>BattleTech</em> don't require ammo) while your opponent is a mech that's slow enough that it can't catch you and doesn't have any weapons with enough range to hit you. Provided there's enough room to maneuver without getting pinned against an obstacle or the edge of the map and nothing to obstruct your line of sight, you can keep running away and firing- eventually you're going to take him down. Some light mechs are even built with this exact tactic in mind, such as the OTT-11J Ostscout, which is blindingly fast and maneuverable but mounts only a pair of Light PPCs as weapons. There are other mechs built with such tactics in mind, but they tend to have weapons that are more powerful and thus don't fall as readily into this trope.
<ul><li> Autocannon/2s are extreme-range tank guns that do as much damage as <em>machine guns</em> against the usual heavy-armored giant robots and combat vehicles in the setting. Discounting artillery and some later high-tech gizmos, they're the longest-ranged weapon in the game so their purpose is to annoy people at range... though some players swear by them <em>en masse</em> as a way to seek out through-armor criticals.
</li><li> Autocannon/5 as well, since they mass eight times as much as a Medium Laser and do just as much damage for a third of a heat and twice the range. Usually Large Lasers or PPCs are better choices, but a curiosity of the 3025 era is that the AC/5 is considered in-universe a viable <em>main gun</em> for medium 'Mechs.
</li><li> Likewise, anything relying on the smaller autocannon, like the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JagerMech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JagerMech">Jager Mech</a></em>&mdash;a heavy 'Mech easily bested by mediums due to its combination of slow speed, paper-thin armor, and anemic arsenal. The <em>Rifleman</em> also, since it has these problems <em>and</em> is easy to overheat.
</li><li> Infantry. In a game of giant robots, having two dozen dudes with rifles take one down can be most embarrassing. This said, infantry are <em>dangerous</em> in cities and forests exactly because two dozen dudes with rifles can use cover and easily run through ground clutter while giant vehicles... well... can't.

<ul><li> The main structure of ping-spam attacks. Especially nasty when your opponent doesn't have a flurrybreaker.
</li><li> There's also a charm for Abyssals which allows the character to use any object (playing cards are used as one example) as an effective weapon. It seems to be designed mostly for Jackie Chan style improvisation, but allows for very humiliating cherry tapping as well with the right specs.

</li><li> High-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> is usually played with a restricted number of viable openings.

Against a player with any semblance of skill, the only thing this family of openings does is waste time and bring your king ahead into danger and unable to castle. Born as a joke and eventually becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme</a> in the Chess community, the opening has restricted uses: as a handicap for the stronger player (in a didactic setting or otherwise), for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">confusing your opponent</a> (especially at an amateur level), as a viable strategy in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessVariants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessVariants">variants</a> such as King of the Hill, or this trope. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kttctaODjP0">Here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is GM Hikaru Nakamura demonstrating its potential for humilitation.

<ul><li> The "walk-off" is basically this: In multiplayer for pinball, players take turns, and the player with the highest score wins. If you are the last player to go, it's your last ball, and you are already ahead of the other players, you can just plunge the ball to start it and walk off to win, hence the name. Whereas in most other cases, such a display is an insult, it's actually the other way around in pinball competitions: When you do a walk-off, you are keeping it simple and to the point (and thus a show of humility), whereas playing the last ball is to rub it in to the other players that they've already lost as the gap in score gets wider and wider (and thus a show of bragging), with a few exceptions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6jlez');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6jlez" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6jlez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are a few games where doing the wrong thing can cause you to lose points, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAdventuresOfRockyAndBullwinkleAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAdventuresOfRockyAndBullwinkleAndFriends">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/WHODunnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/WHODunnit">Whodunnit?</a>?</em>, meaning you can lose your lead by playing the ball instead of terminating it as quickly as possible.</span>

In the end, he won with superior tactics, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> that monsters that had weak attacks could still defeat more powerful monsters by using the right tactics.

The goal, of course, was half humiliation, half 'good stories to tell'.
</li><li> Occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> fights will be finished with a single jab.
<ul><li> Anderson Silva's fight with Forrest Griffin. Silva pummeled Griffin for several minutes, landing power punches and knocking Griffin all around the arena. The blow that finished it, however, was a short jab with his weak hand <em>while backing away</em>.
</li><li> Street fighter Kimbo Slice lost all of his reputation as a heavyweight MMA fighter when he faced Seth Petruzelli, a light heavyweight who took the fight on short notice. Within half a minute, Petruzelli landed a single jab that staggered Slice and ended the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> Many supremely talented boxers do this at various times during their careers:
<ul><li> Featherweight great Willie Pep once won a round without throwing a single punch, his defensive prowess was so great.
</li><li> Roy Jones Jr. used to actively clown around in the ring and rarely ever showed his full skillset in a fight because he was so much better than everyone else.
</li><li> Muhammad Ali made it famous with his 'rope-a-dope' technique, in which he absorbed blow after blow from an opponent in order to 1) lure his opponent into a false sense of confidence and 2) tire his opponent out, thus allowing him to finish the fight fairly quickly from that point.
</li></ul></li><li> The first "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match, which pitted 55-year-old ex-champ Bobby Riggs and then-current female champion Margaret Court. One might expect that Riggs would try to use his male muscle to overwhelm Court with powerful shots. Instead, he played "soft" and hit mostly lobs and drop shots to keep her off balance en route to a crushing 6-1, 6-2 victory.
