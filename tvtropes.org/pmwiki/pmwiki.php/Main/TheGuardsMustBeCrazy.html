<ul><li> The Britannian guards frequently wait until Lelouch has geassed them before actually doing their job. Twice they have waited for Lelouch to give a long pretentious speech before he geassed them into killing themselves. Reaches its peak when Lelouch just walks up and waits more than a minute while the guards attack him with spears before geassing the entire room. Although he was still a Prince, and thus it's doubtful assault against royalty goes over great in Britannia.
</li><li> The Chinese Federation are even worse. While they do have guns, they just stare dumbfounded as Xingke fights them off with a sword since the only Chinese soldiers to fight are the ones with spears, and then they watch as Lelouch gives a speech before he finally has the sense to take his gun and hold Tianzi hostage with it. Granted, they were in the middle of a wedding chapel surrounded with VIPs from two superpowers, so it's possible that they may have simply wanted to avoid accidentally shooting someone else, but the guards outside have no excuse.
</li><li> In one episode, an unarmed Lelouch and Kallen find some Britannians on a remote island and effortlessly steal their ridiculously powerful prototype mech. The mech itself was unguarded, and the "guards" <em>left the keys in the ignition.</em> Kallen has to beat up a few guys, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">they don't make use of their firepower advantage.</a> Euphemia was fairly close, though, so it may have been to avoid regicide.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Windaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Windaria">Windaria</a></em> the key to Lunara's floodgates are guarded by an old man that sleeps most of the day in a guardhouse without a door. At the start of the film, a spy walks in there, takes the keys, and no one realizes anything until he opens the flood gates. Considering this could have flooded the entire city it merges with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> has Piyomon and Gomamon knock out and steel some food from a particularly dumb <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost">Bakemon</a> guard by goading him into taunting them with it.

Then Yuki, from Harlock's crew, walks in the prison, <em>presents herself as one of Harlock's pirates</em> and <em><strong>asks for confirmation if that's where they keep Daiba for the trap</strong></em>, at which point they just let her pass. Harlock's vice-commander Yattaran, who had got himself thrown in the same cell as Daiba to help him in a "proper" escape attempt, can barely believe it, the guards belately realize they look like fools... And the plan to follow Harlock's ship falls through because the radar operator was <em>playing golf with the prime minister</em>.

<ul><li> An old story saw the government imprisoning them in specially designed cells. Reed Richards and Johnny managed to find tiny flaws in the prison design. The Thing found that the door was strong enough to take one punch from him, but not multiple blows, which makes the prison designer crazy. Sue Storm turned herself invisible. And yes, guards set to guard The Invisible Woman opened the door <em>because they couldn't see her</em>.
</li><li> A not-so-old issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFantasticFour">Ultimate Fantastic Four</a></em> uses the same idea, only it was evil zombie versions of the entire team in one cell together, and the Reed Richards counterparts prepared the trick by claiming he had built a teleporter from a ballpoint pen and a string of hair. Zombie Susan even lampshades how amazed she is that the guards were tricked by the Invisible Woman... turning invisible. This one is especially pathetic, given that even if the teleporter claim had been true, there would still have been no earthly reason to open the doors.
</li><li> A case of "The Security Designers Must Be Crazy" happened after Reed and Doom were apparently killed. The rest of the team and Llyja was captured by the Skulls who thought they had designed a cell and shackles that could nullify their powers. Well, the stuff worked... For about an hour. After that, escaping was pretty easy. (Not to mention that the four of them were <em>very</em> angry at the Skrulls for humiliating them with their version of a "perp walk" beforehand, so to speak.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a> the Gladiator</em>, Asterix and Obelix find a guard who works at the prison where they are holding Cacofonix prisoner. Asterix tells Obelix that they have to ask him some "clever questions" to find out his exact location. Obelix, to Asterix's astonishment, simply asks "Hey you! Where is Cacofonix imprisoned?" The (overly tired) guard replies in detail adding "but it's a secret" while Asterix sits there befuddled.
</li><li> The guards at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>-verse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse">Arkham Asylum</a>. Whether it's letting the Joker substitute all their real guns for popguns, allowing him access to janitorial chemicals that let him mix together some Joker Venom, or constructing a <em>hot air balloon that allows him to fly over the walls</em>, the increasingly ridiculous, contrived and unbelievable ways that the Joker and the other Bat-villains escape from Arkham would be construed as painfully bad in any other franchise. For the <em>Batman</em> comics, on the other hand, it's par for the course. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> kicks in when you realize that it's probably safer for the guards to not try and stop people like the Joker, Killer Croc, Two Face, and Poison Ivy. The guards survive longer if they stay out of the way of escaping inmates, and it's safer for the guards if Joker is on the streets instead of at their daily work place.
</li><li> Marvel had a version of Arkham called Ravencroft that would have been far more secure if not for incompetent staff and even more incompetent government officials funding the place. It was originally run by Dr. Ashley Kafka with Colonel John Jameson heading the security, but her insistence that some inmates could be cured (when they obviously couldn't) led to problems. After the government decided that the Chameleon could stand trial, she made a serious breech of protocol by taking him out of his cell and into the facility's basement, which of course, let him escape. After the crisis this caused, both Kafka and Jameson were fired, which only made things worse. The first replacement actually thought that the extensive security devoted to one inmate &mdash; who happened to be Carnage &mdash; was <em>too much of a drain on the budget</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">turned part of it off</a>, completely ignoring the screaming protests of the veteran guards. It took Carnage all of ten seconds to escape (and worst of all, his symbiote nearly possessed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a> this time).
</li><li> In an early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohanAndPeewit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohanAndPeewit">Johan and Peewit</a></em> story, a bunch of guards abandon all common sense for a barrel of mead, leaving the guard room empty (and allowing Johan to sabotage the drawbridge).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the very first story, it's mentioned that Diabolik had broken out of the supposedly unescapable prison of Asen. More recently a flasback shows how he did it: he killed two guards who gave him a small opening, stole the uniform of one of them and ruined his face to slow identification, then took off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">perfect mask</a> and walked out dressed as a guard. Granted, that was before the police knew of his masks or his true face, but the guards still failed to notice a man in uniform who was <em>not</em> one of them...
</li><li> The second time Diabolik was arrested. They caught him with his true face and by now knew his masks, so they managed to keep him in jail long enough to sentence him to death, but Eva Kant, at the time not a wanted criminal yet, broke him out the very day before the execution. How? Easy: she bribed two guards to bring him to her so she could give him a proper goodbye (she had also confessed being in love with him), and when they brought him to her she brought him in a shack where the two <em>drugged Eva's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> AKA George Caron, <strong>secretary of the Minister of Justice</strong>, put on him a mask with Diabolik's face, and when the guards told them it was time to bring Diabolik back him gave them Caron</em>. The guards, not suspecting anything in spite of the masks being now known to the public, brought Caron back in the death row, and then, at the appointed time, on the guillotine, where he was executed, and had Ginko not noticed 'Diabolik' was moving like he was drugged nobody would have ever realized what had happened.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in the rest of the series: knowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">who they're dealing with</a>, whenever Diabolik or Eva are arrested the guards keep them under <em>heavy</em> guard, ready to shoot to kill on sight and adopting such things as putting them in a jail <em>surrounded by swamps</em> (Eva's first arrest). Sure, Diabolik and Eva always break out in the end, but that's because they're just that good, and have to resort to increasingly complex plans. One example is how Diabolik broke Eva out of that jail in the swamps: first he got seen kidnapping a top model to convince the world he had dumped Eva to get them to lower their guard or at least get enough pity for her so she wouldn't be executed, then, when Ginko kept the surveillance tigh to be safe and Eva was sentenced to jail time, he <em>caused a typhoid fever outbreak in the jail</em> (Eva was vaccinated, so she wasn't in danger) to get it evacuated, caused a distraction so Ginko wouldn't be around, and then derailed the train that was the only way in or out, <em><strong>and even this was was a close thing</strong></em> (Ginko realized what was happening and went to the phone to warn the jail mere moments before the train got derailed). Following breakouts need different formulas because the guards are prepared to foil previously used methods and whatever they can think of (and it's a lot of things) <em>and</em> do their best to keep the prisoner isolated until Diabolik is executed.

To make her stop, the irritated guard walks close to her cell, and Chrysalis seizes her chance to slam his head against the bars and steal the keys he's carrying as he falls unconscious. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After his takeover, Jewelius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">murdered all the Royal Guards</a> who were injured during the Changeling invasion yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">remained loyal</a> to the usurper princesses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TradingBarsForStripes">filling the greatly decreased ranks with convicts he bribed to be loyal to himself</a>.

<ul><li> In the tenth chapter, when Applejack and Rarity disguise themselves as maids while sneaking in the castle (with Cadance hiding in the housekeeping cart they're pushing), they nervously claim to the first guard who stops them that they're doing some late night cleaning. He eyes them suspiciously for a moment before letting them carry on.

<ul><li> An early fic has two guards actually invoking this when a panicked Trixie comes up to Canterlot Castle's front gate, demanding entrance, but not having any ID to prove she is who she says she is. The two guards know Trixie, but unfortunately they also hate Trixie, and state that if somepony like Trixie showed up, acting very un-Trixie like and demanding entrance, well, they'd have to be <em>stupid</em> to let her in, right? They're also not very concerned by Trixie's concern that their delaying might get her killed by BonBon, who is having a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">stressful</a> day. Then the angry naked human appears out of nowhere.
</li><li> Another story, set several years before, shows a young Shining Armor having a near-miss with this, when Princess Luna shows up to say her apprentice Trixie can go into the city without any guards. Shining and his captain notice Princess Luna slip up on the pronunciation of one word - it's Trixie in disguise as Luna.

<ul><li> The guards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> fall prey to a few of these. They're decent enough at their jobs when they're in action, but it's the boring surveillance part of the day that always slips them up. At one point in the movie, they <em>all</em> leave their posts to check on a colleague who's just collapsed. Later, they don't notice Helen when she's right behind them. She even talks. Later still, nobody is paying attention to the security cameras and are all partying in the background. Only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Mirage</a> notices the escapees that don't even bother to avoid the security cameras. Most notably, though, is later in the same scene where it gets absurd enough that Bob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it. They enter a large room with no-one in it and he absently wonders, "Where are all the guards?"
</li><li> Double subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersVsAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersVsAliens">Monsters vs. Aliens</a></em>.

He recognizes one of them as a clone that's "defective beyond repair"... and immediately orders the other two to dispose of him. And gives them a key card. And a gun.

</li><li> The Guards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em>. They cannot find an old lady who has kidnapped the baby princess for almost two decades, when she happened to be in a tower within riding distance. Then said princess's crown gets stolen right under their noses. Then one of the thieves comes back to Corona later with a girl with 70 feet long of hair and they don't notice it, even though he is dancing around. The only competent member is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse">Maximus</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the only one to make crime virtually disappear</span>. The same thief was able to walk up to the palace and meet the King and Queen face-to-face. Their incompetence is proven even more later on when a 14-year old kid is able to distract all the guards around Corona by putting up a smoke-screen and knocking them out with a giant monster while the kid himself somehow managed to infiltrate all the way to the castle and kidnap the Queen without any resistance whatsoever, demonstrating that the guards didn't even try to guard parts of the castle nor do they even bother to bodyguard a very important figure in the country.
</li><li> A truly memorable subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TitanAE">Titan A.E.</a></em>: Preed, Stith, and Korso are trying to free Akima from a slave prison. They see a large, brutish guard around a corner, and Stith offers to take him out. Preed refuses, saying, "This requires cunning and deception." They then walk up to the guard, and Preed spins a tale that he and Stith are traders, and that Korso is the slave they're looking to sell. After delivering his story, we have this exchange.

A heist involves Luis impersonating a security guard. When another guard asks him what he's doing, he claims that the "boss man" told him to check the room. The guard he's trying to con? The boss man. No word whether it would have worked on any other guard, though.
<ul><li> Hilariously averted when Lang attempts to break into an old Stark warehouse <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(now the Avengers headquarters)</span>. He doesn't see anyone around and thinks he's scot-free, only for the intrusion to be investigated and spotted <em>immediately</em>.

</li><li> The plot in <em>Condor</em> pretty much is built on this: the villain had stolen the code to control the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, and was captured and put in jail.

</li><li> The hapless security guards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lifeforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lifeforce">Lifeforce</a></em> are this trope. The first one falls head and heels for the naked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">Space Girl</a> and gets his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> sucked for this, allowing her to escape from the autopsy room.

Ironically, Larry is a guard. Would YOU stick around once the dinosaur skeletons and such started moving?
<ul><li> In both "Night at the Museum" movies, it's more like "the museum administrators must be crazy." Larry's initiation involves being given a rule book, a uniform, a brief tour by his predecessor, and a small note of rather unusual instructions and then being left to his own devices, with no backup. If it weren't for the army of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObjects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObjects">Animate Inanimate Objects</a>, he would have been completely helpless when the inevitable robbery occurs. His British counterpart in the second movie has it even worse. While she <em>is</em> quite competent, and did go entirely by the rule book, the closest thing she has to a weapon, is a hammer she brings from home while Larry at least has a night-stick, a flashlight, and pepper spray. Like Larry, she also has no backup, except a long, complicated phone number to call, and then only when she's absolutely certain things have escalated to a point that she can't possibly handle it by herself. As graphically shown, this puts her completely at the mercy of any determined or marginally competent group of thieves, criminals, or malcontents intending to do her or the museum harm. She lampshades that she's starved for conversation because she doesn't have co-workers at the job.

They manage to fool the completely incompetant guards despite having to resort to using an English-Klingon dictionary to look up their answers and making several grammatical errors during the conversation.
<ul><li> Actually explained in the novelization, which states that the operators of the listening post assumed the <em>Enterprise</em> crew were just harmless smugglers, not a Federation cruiser, and so let them through (the Klingon officer's parting shot "Don't catch any bugs" is an old smuggler's in-joke.)
</li><li> Star Trek VI also has what must be one of the most idiotic examples in the history of cinema. Kirk and McCoy are in an inescapable prison, but conspirators want them dead to be sure they're really out of the way. They have another prisoner tell Kirk and McCoy, "I can get outside the beaming shield, but I have nobody to beam me up when I get there. If you have a way to get off the surface, we can escape together." When Kirk verifies that they can beam up once outside the shield, the prisoner, with the help of the conspirators, leads them to a position outside the shield where the conspirators will shoot them with the excuse that they were trying to escape. The conspirators are then surprised to see Kirk and McCoy beam up right in front of their eyes, despite having gone out of their way to verify that they were prepared to do so.

Ben uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick">Jedi Mind Trick</a> version of this after turning the tractor beam off. This is actually an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsProbablyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsProbablyNothing">It's Probably Nothing</a>. Presumably, Ben made the guards think they heard something off in the distance, and like intelligent guards, they go to investigate. Unfortunately for them, it really was nothing.
</li><li> Averted with the guards in the Death Star's prison block. Luke and Han, dressed as Stormtroopers, come with Chewbacca as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanPrisoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrojanPrisoner">Trojan Prisoner</a> and say to the guards that they're transferring Chewie to their prison block. The commander doesn't fall for it, since such a transfer should have been documented and communicated beforehand. As the guard is about to check for confirmation, Han and Chewbacca lose their shit and start shooting around. Central command notices and calls in to investigate. Han again tries to bluff his way through, but they demand his serial number as verification, which he can't provide, so central command immediately sends Stormtroopers to take care of them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em> novel <em>Death Star</em> turns this on its head. One of the normal human Stormtrooper commanders was sensitive to the Force and really hated his bosses. He misled his own troops and thus allowed Han and the others an easier path to freedom.
</li><li> Additionally inverted in that a rather large number of competent major and minor characters all at some point had Imperial guard training or at least Imperial pilot training (which does include some guard training) as the explanation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> makes you wonder: If you were the radio guy and you heard "Security, this is <em><strong>CLANG!!!</strong></em>" followed by dead silence, would you send a team to investigate or would you just shrug and continue eating your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Snickers</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">M.

</li><li> This Trope can be applied to <em>all</em> of El Guapo's thugs who act as guards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeAmigos">&iexcl;Three Amigos!</a></em>. In one scene, Lucky is chained up in the dungeon, but the guard tosses the keys to his chains on the floor to taunt him, figuring he can't reach them (it takes a few tries, but he does), while Dusty is able to rescue Carmen because the guard in charge of watching her is asleep on duty. (It's the middle of the day.) In fact, El Guapo's men seem only slightly more competent than the would-be heroes are, at most.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138">THX 1138</a></em>, in that, though the guards are glaringly incompetent, the general population (with the sole exceptions of the hero and his girlfriend) are too stupid/strung out to notice. For example, the guards routinely leave the doors to a high security prison unlocked, but none of the prisoners had ever bothered to check.

Then the server room door alarm goes off, and he immediately goes to investigate, even though he's clearly afraid that the intruder is armed. When Sam escapes to the crane on the roof, the same fat guard is the only one willing to follow him up there, confront the "thief", and try to talk Sam down. Very brave for Some Guy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman</a></em>: Steve and Sameer infiltrate that gala by pretending to be a German officer and his chauffeur.

<ul><li> For example, in <em>Shadow on the Sand</em>, two Vassagonian gaolers believe their prisoner has escaped when they can't see him through the peephole, just because Lone Wolf is sitting against the door. And he isn't even doing it on purpose, but still gets the opportunity to ambush them when they open the cell.
</li><li> In <em>Dawn of the Dragons</em>, the Eldenorian guards capturing Lone Wolf and bringing him before Prince Lutha take his gold, backpack, and weapons... but not the weapon-like special items.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em>, the text mentions how when Sergeant Colon is on guard duty, he "kept the cell keys in a tin box in the bottom drawer of his desk, a long way out of reach of any stick, hand, dog, cunningly thrown belt, or trained Klatchian monkey spider (making Fred Colon possibly unique in the annals of jail history)."
</li><li> Seemingly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">The Last Continent</a></em>, where the guards at Bugrup Prison are wise to every escape trope, but haven't worked out how Tinhead Ned (and later Rincewind) <em>did</em> escape (the jail door can be lifted off its hinges). Possibly because they reckon it makes a better ballad if the prisoner escapes and then gets killed in a last stand at the Post Office.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em>, it's noted the guards of Djelyibabi are intentionally hired for being stupid and unimaginative, in case they start getting ideas, especially ones along the lines of "why aren't <em>we</em> in charge?"

After a few seconds, Snouty actually steps into the cells, and Vimes' monologue notes if he did it with the <em>other</em> prisoner he's got, Snouty would be dead a few days early.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom">Doom</a>: Hell on Earth</em>, a pair of bored Clydes are frisking zombies boarding a plane.

</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart">Get Smart</a></em> novels, one guard is particularly immune to this. Instead of entering the cell when Max sets fire to the bed as a diversion, the guard merely opens up on him with the firehose. However, just a few pages, later the rest of the guards in the prison are fooled by Max writing "out of order" with a piece of chalk on a death ray!

He's smart enough to know that "the staff of a wizard may be more than a prop for age", but lets Gandalf through with said staff because he deems he's a friend here to help (a judgment that is soon vindicated). It's a bit more vague in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">the movie</a>, but it's certainly a plausible interpretation of his actions there.

</li></ul></li><li> The Stuart Gibbs &#145;&#146;Funjungle&#146;&#146; novels get a lot of humor from the incompetence of the parks security guards. After an animal is stolen the guards fail to realize the correct time the theft occurred (if they had the. Security footage would have easily solved the case), a guard assigned to prevent the poisoning of giraffes fails to realize that it&#146;s his own actions of feeding then dangerous plants that&#146;s making them sick and one of the few times they actually catch a criminal it&#146;s because the officer pursuing the man tripped over a little kid, and accidentally tapered an old lady who the fleeing criminal then tripped over. By the third book, park owner JJ <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCracken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCracken">Mc Cracken</a> has tried to get around this by hiring he more professional Chief Honneker to run things smoother (which despite some initial arrogance, he arguably does) but the rank and file guards still screw up a lot.

The plan actually works.

He <em>was</em> the Senior Apprentice(with the nifty Magykal cuffs to prove it), and he <em>was</em> on official business (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting Jenna, the Princess</span>).

<ul><li> Most classes that would traditionally be used as guards don't have Spot, Listen or Sense Motive as class skills. This essentially makes them partially blind, hearing-impaired, and incredibly gullible. Exactly how this plays out depends on the DM. Most play the trope straight because guards tend not to be treated as more than minor enemies. Those skills are mainly intended to counteract Hide, Move Silently, and Bluff. In addition, those skills are not infallible unless the DM hands NPCs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>. For example, no matter what your Hide skill is, if you walk in front of a guard without some form of cover, he sees you, no matter what.
</li><li> Scouts used as guards can avert this trope. They possess Spot, Listen and Sense Motive as class skills. They get 8 base skill points per level. In addition, they have Hide and Move Silently as class skills, so they can stand guard without being readily visible.

<ul><li> Somewhat justified in that without having a miniature zeppelin they would never have gotten in. Identity would only have to be checked at the entrance and exit. Even if someone did get a guard's uniform there is only one exit and presumably, they DO check guards leaving.

<ul><li> Used and slightly lampshaded in an episode where Huey, Dewey, and Louie are imprisoned in a room with a guard looking in at them once every hour or so. While two of the identical triplets work on the means of their escape, the third one sits in front of a trifold mirror, giving the impression &mdash; sort of &mdash; that there are three boys sitting there. Lampshaded in that one of the boys asks whether the guard won't notice that they're all wearing the same clothes, only to be told by the one devising the plan that "he's so tired, he's not going to care WHAT we're wearing, just so long as there's three of us." Improbably, this turns out to be true.
</li><li> They mess with the guards again in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DisneyAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DisneyAdventures">Disney Adventures</a></em> comic when the Beagle Boys are trying to break in to Scrooge's new voice-identification safe (one member of the gang can imitate Scrooge's voice) and leave Burger Beagle behind to guard the tied-up nephews. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Correctly reasoning that Burger's gluttony far outweighs his intelligence</a>, the kids begin to "casually" discuss how great it would be to have a cheeseburger, which they discuss in mouthwatering detail.

</div></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> has the ease of a situation being compared to escape from Canadian Alcatraz. Cue the scene where an inmate simply walks up to a guard and asks if he can leave through this door. The guard simply says sure, just be back before bedtime, and letting the inmate leave.
</li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero</a></em> episode "Grey Hairs and Growing Pains". When the Joes pretend to be civilian customers for Cobra's health spa, they are recognized immediately, and the Cobra agents play along and then trap them. Later, after the Joes get turned into old people and children, they pretend to be a family on a road trip and get into a Cobra base by asking the guard for directions and then for a bathroom. Once inside, they are immediately recognized again. Serpentor orders Dr. Mindbender to arrest the front guard for his incompetence.
</li><li> One early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> featured a night-guard at an aquarium who was too busy feeding the animals cookies to notice Arnold and his grandmother coming in and leaving with a homesick sea turtle.

The latter is stated to be a model prisoner, having accrued quite a few privileges and "necessities" during his stint there, but the guards still don't take chances with him or the other prisoners. A retina scanner is the only way into the cells, and when Humanite asks the guards to bring over his dinner, claiming to be unwell, they immediately draw their truncheons on the off chance it's a ruse. This being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Ultra-Humanite</a>, however, they don't take into account that part of the floor has been electrified enough to render them unconscious right as they wheel the food over it, giving Humanite and Luthor the chance they need to escape.

Tirac's guards are good at their jobs. They spot Megan and the ponies slipping in, and use smart tactics against the group. However, the heroes are badass enough to win anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in "It's About Time". Twilight sneaks into the private library of the palace and does a <em>VERY</em> poor job of staying hidden, yet the guards are completely oblivious to her. She finally gets caught trying to open the door to the library, and the guard greets her politely and unlocks the door. Since Twilight is the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Princess Celestia, she's always welcome in the palace and library &mdash; the guards were just <em>ignoring</em> her.
</li><li> During "A Bird in the Hoof", a <em>pet phoenix</em>, dying of old age (therefore incredibly obvious because featherless) manages to trick Celestia's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorian Guard</a> <em>while they are putting up Wanted posters with that bird's face on</em>. Twilight and Fluttershy aren't any better.
</li><li> The Season 2 Finale has the entire Royal Guard up and underarms because they were tipped off that something bad <em>is</em> going to happen. But when it does happen, they are apparently still surprised enough to be overrun without putting up as much as a fight. Let's just face it: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless">these guys do not do good at their job.</a>
</li><li> In "Rarity Investigates!", a stranger offering them a cake is enough to get three guards to desert their post to eat it. As a result, Rainbow Dash gets framed for a crime.
</li><li> In "Sparkle's Seven", despite Shining Armor's efforts to ramp up the security of the castle, the royal guards still aren't sterling examples of vigilance. Even discounting Zephyr Breeze (whom Luna assigned with the expectation he'd fail anyway), the other guards are easily falling for distractions &#151; twice, by "Apple Chord"'s singing and then by Pinkie Pie's party. Also, one guard getting his medal stolen &#151; which is the key to the doors of the castle &#151; isn't noticed nor immediately reported. And another guard is easily fooled by Rarity's Paper-Thin Disguise when she pretends being here to relieve him.
</li><li> Season 9 has a very glaring example in "Frenemies" where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grogar</span> sends three ex-big bads, Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy Glow, to retrieve his bell so the former can restore his full power. On the mountain the bell is being held, a lone guard, Rusty Bucket, encounters Cozy and completely fails to note her seemingly being on her own without any guardians. Even after she throws a huge temper tantrum, Rusty at most just feels bummed when Cozy leaves and tells him that she never wanted to be friends in the first place. Even later, when Cozy brings back Tirek and Chrysalis in tow, Rusty seemingly doesn't think to inform the princesses about three highly dangerous criminals being on the loose.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NinaNeedsToGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NinaNeedsToGo">Nina Needs to Go!</a></em> has a scene where Nina and her grandmother set off an alarm by going into a not-allowed area on the way to the bathroom. One guard asks if they should stop them, and another replied: "Nah when you gotta go, you gotta go". In addition to this being dumb, <em>how was he supposed to know they were on their way to the bathroom?</em>
</li><li> With guards like Yippey, Yappey, and Yahooey (a.k.a. the Goofy Guards from the <em>Peter Potamus</em> show), who needs villains? What did the king ever do to deserve them?

Though often it may be hard to distinguish between proper incompetence and unwillingness on part of the guards (especially soldiers), who were sometimes keen to turn a blind eye (or at least claimed having done that to avoid being hung or jailed for war crimes).
</li><li> A French POW convinced his guards to let him walk out of the camp several times, every time a <em>couple of weeks</em> in a row to visit his family back in occupied France, <em>if</em> he promised to return, bring along some wine and good food, and keep quiet about about the whole affair. So <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CodeOfHonour">he did</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaxManus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaxManus">Max Manus</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> escaped from hospital (after his famous window jump) because of this. His hospital room was actually guarded by two men (Norwegian collaborators). He would never have made it out if the two guards hadn't fallen asleep on duty. Only <em>then</em> did he proceed to slap the nurse and bolt.
</li><li> In Germany, an inmate managed to get out of prison by climbing into a cardboard box and getting shipped out. Apparently no-one checked to see all the prisoners working that detail came back or why the package was unusually heavy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Hideo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Kojima</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7730018.stm">would be so proud.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> A Britisher named David James who escaped from a World War II German POW camp, analyzed the challenge in a 1947 account published in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OpcaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22escaping+was+essentially+a+psychological+problem,+depending+on+the+inobservance+of+mankind,+coupled+with+a+ready+acceptance+of+the+everyday+at+its+face+value%22&amp;dq=%22escaping+was+essentially+a+psychological+problem,+depending+on+the+inobservance+of+mankind,+coupled+with+a+ready+acceptance+of+the+everyday+at+its+face+value%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L1jWU7i4FpChyATyuICoAg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA">Blackwood's Magazine<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> as follows, "To sum it up, I came to the conclusion that escaping was essentially a psychological problem, depending on the inobservance of mankind, coupled with a ready acceptance of the everyday at its face value."
</li></ul></li><li> In 1982, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fagan_incident">an unhinged man climbed the wall of Buckingham palace.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Someone saw him and reported it, but by the time guards came to look, he was gone and they decided he must have left already; they raised no alarm. When he went through a window, the security system alerted a policeman on duty, who assumed it was a malfunction and <strong>silenced the alarm twice in a row</strong>. Wandering through the halls, he passed a housekeeper, who <strong>greeted him</strong>. He eventually made it to the Queen's chamber, where she was sleeping unguarded, woke her up, and chatted to her as she tried to get help by two different methods (a button and the phone); nobody came for ten minutes (the person who <em>did</em> eventually show up was a housemaid). As Hollywood writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGoldman">William Goldman</a> said it, if you would put this in a movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">people probably would throw rotten eggs at the screen</a> for breaking their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief">Suspension of Disbelief</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">He also got cigarettes upon request.</a> Even better, they only crime he was charged with was stealing a bottle of cheap wine, because, at the time, trespassing was a civil offense rather than a criminal one (this has been changed). The charge was dropped when he was committed to a mental hospital.
</li><li> Gilbert Galvan escaped an American prison by waiting in a rec area until the guards left for coffee, then using a pool cue to open the drawer of their desk and fish out the keys. He later went on to be known as Canada's "Phantom Bandit".
</li><li> The Obama White House was crashed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">three times</a> by uninvited guests. The first and third cases took advantage of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill">Bavarian Fire Drill</a>, while the second gatecrash was a result of some misguided tour organizers sending the tourists to a White House luncheon instead of on the tour.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mas_Selamat_bin_Kastari">Mas Selamat bin Kastari<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, one of the most influential terrorists in Southeast Asia escaped Singapore's most well-guarded prison by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomBreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BathroomBreakOut">going to the toilet</a>, changing quickly, and climbing out the window. When he was recaptured more than a year later, it was revealed that he climbed into the storm drains, went 20+ kilometers north in 3 days, created improvised flotation devices from trash, and swam across from Singapore to Malaysia and met up with other operatives. Apparently, it was so unexpected, that theories ranged from his escape a cover for the fact that he had died in detention, he used black magic to get out, or he was allowed to escape so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoEscaping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoEscaping">he could lead authorities to other terrorists</a>.
</li><li> In 1987, a 18-year-old West-German aviator named Mathias Rust managed to fly straight through several supposedly impregnable layers of Soviet air-defense systems and land his Cessna <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TXIGfL2iFw">near the center of Red Square<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. What made this worse was that he was spotted on several occasions by air defense crews and interceptors, but most of them either assumed he was friendly, thought he had crashed shortly afterwards, or otherwise failed to gain permission to shoot him down. The event ended up irreparably damaging the credibitly of the Soviet military and led to the firing of many senior officers.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19219_the-7-craziest-things-ever-done-to-get-laid.html">Czechoslovakian hairdresser-turned-soldier-turned-Nazi-POW Horace Greasley<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> repeatedly broke out of the POW camp he was transferred to so he could have sex with his previous camp's quarry director's daughter. And then snuck <em>back into his current POW camp</em> as if nothing happened. <em><strong>He did this three times a week for five years.</strong></em> Then the war ended and he was set free.
</li><li> October 2012: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/media/news/a430056/bbc-film-crew-held-at-gunpoint-after-sneaking-into-area-51.html">A BBC film crew working on a UFO documentary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> violated the security at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51">Area 51</a>. They didn't get far, mainly because the crew knocked on the guard shack on the back gate, after spending about half an hour trying to get attention by dancing for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecurityCamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecurityCamera">security cameras</a> on the entrance area. They were then arrested and fined.
<ul><li> Related to this, most military base fences (and border crossings) are not built on the property line but a few feet back. This allows the guards to charge violators with Trespassing since they are technically, already on the property. Area 51 is notorious as the signs warning you about Trespassing are so far away from the property line, that if you get close enough to read them, security is already aware of you because of the huge dust cloud you kicked up while driving down the access road.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_theft">The Gardner Museum heist<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, one of the biggest art heists in history, was pulled off partially thanks to this trope.
<ul><li> Two men got past the security guard at the front desk, Richard Abath, by pressing the buzzer by the door and claiming they were policemen who were coming to investigate a disturbance. Despite knowing he wasn't supposed to let unauthorized guests inside, he did, since he figured the rule didn't apply to the police. The "policemen" then ordered him to get out from behind the desk, and handcuffed him. Abath has also admitted he frequently came to work intoxicated, and that he went along with what the men wanted because he was worried that if he was arrested, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">he wouldn't be able to attend a Grateful Dead concert he had tickets to</a>. Unsurprisingly, his sheer incompetence has made many wonder if he was in on it... and perhaps even more unsurprisingly, law enforcement (although not completely ruling out the idea) has decided that Abath probably wasn't smart enough to pull it off.
</li><li> There was also another guard, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise">who was presumably more competent than Abath</a>, but by the time he showed up, Abath was already handcuffed, and he quickly was as well. Unlike Abath, he had the sense to ask <em>why</em> they were supposedly being arrested, at which point the thieves admitted that they weren't, they were just being robbed. Upon being told that if he didn't cause any trouble, no-one had to get hurt, the second guard dryly responded, "Don't worry. They don't pay me enough to get hurt."
</li></ul></li><li> When infamous wealthy pedophile and trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was imprisoned, he was supposed to get checked on twice an hour. His guards, however, were <em>alarmingly</em> inattentive, despite Epstein having been on suicide watch after a supposed attempt a few weeks ago. It turned out they had falsified at least seventy-five checks on the guy, and didn't discover that Epstein had died until they delivered his breakfast in the morning. This was despite his cell being only about fifteen feet away from their workstation. Pretty much the only thing everyone can agree on is that these guards were either phenomenally stupid or being paid off.
</li><li> The Transport Security Administration of America is fairly infamous for their shoddy work, with undercover investigators discovering that TSA agents failed to find hidden weapons or contraband roughly 96% of the time. They're often considered the most famous modern example of "security theater": that is, security measures that reassure civilians that the government is doing <em>something</em> and therefore they must be safe, but don't actually work all that well for taking down criminals.
