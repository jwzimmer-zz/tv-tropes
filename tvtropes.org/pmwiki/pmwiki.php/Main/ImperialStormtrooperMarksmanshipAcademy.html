</p><p>This trope involves a degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, in that by far most shots fired in firefights or combat are misses. Some sources report that in WWII, the average soldier needed to fire two hundred rounds for every hit scored on an enemy; numerous other examples are mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section of this page. So the fictional bad guys don't necessarily actually suffer from unrealistic inaccuracy; rather, the heroes' fictional performance would probably count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a> in real life. To make matters worse, though, most fictional bad guys exhibit lousy trigger discipline, always firing from the hip and in long bursts, even when firing at a lone target that sometimes isn't even shooting back, instead of looking down the sights and <em>aiming</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: Even though it's arrows instead of bullets, none of the marauding bandits, mouthy soldiers or terrifying hellspawn can ever seem to hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsmen">Guts</a> even when there's a hundreds of them and Guts is just casually strolling across the battlefield. In fact most shots Guts just <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160801044904/http://img.bato.to/comics/2013/09/03/b/read52262522ac3de/img000054.png">deflects<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> off the flat of his blade which seems pretty reasonable as Guts's sword is huge and could provide cover but then as the series goes on and the villains get more skilled, some being super Indo-Arabian ninjas and others demon marksmen the excuse boils down to Guts's reflexes being that good.
<ul><li> The only real time this was truly subverted is when Guts was protecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Casca</a> and got hit three times, the third even going straight his hand and sticking there, forcing Guts to swing one handed. Casca showed much shock and gratitude at his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">human shielding</a>.
</li><li> The Villains aren't left out of the loop either as none of the human armies (except for the really skilled ones) can ever hit the demon-like Apostles and when they do find their mark it normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">doesn't do anything</a> or just makes them angry. One truly galling example is Griffith after his evil resurrection is shot at with a hail of arrows... And they all miss their mark by a good yard &mdash; though to be fair to this guy, this scene is meant to show that even though he's Griffith again, he has retained all of his godlike supernatural power as Femto.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> plays this trope straight and often to a level that threatens one's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief">Suspension of Disbelief</a>. But, then again, its an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">action movie masquerading as an episodic anime, so it makes sense.</a>
</li><li> <em>Space Pirate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a></em> episode 39. The Mazone invade the Arcadia. They are supposedly well-trained troops and are constantly firing. Arcadia personnel mow down hundreds of them with the number of friendly deaths being at most in the single digits, and except for a single named character (whose death is foretold in the episode title, who is the only one to get a dramatic death scene, and whose death is the only one that makes an impression on the crew), none of those other deaths are even confirmed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Coppelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Coppelion">Coppelion</a></em> the antagonists do quite a bit of shooting. Usually fully automatic, often on still targets at rather short distances out in the open. Don't count on anyone hitting what they aim for.
</li><li> Happens fairly regularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>... only to be dramatically subverted at the worst possible moment.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>: Excel explains to the mooks firing at her that they'll never hit her because of this trope, and doesn't even bother to move.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">FFVII</a>: Last Order</em>, Zack evades Shinra fire by backflipping rapidly. Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroTrackingFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroTrackingFailure">Hero-Tracking Failure</a>, as the troops in question seem to be firing at his feet. (Compare to a similar scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixRevolutions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixRevolutions">The Matrix Revolutions</a></em>, and you'll see why this shouldn't have worked.)
</li><li> Amarao's men in the fifth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em> simply cannot hit Haruko, no matter how many of them there are. For context, at one point, a dozen or so men dogpile her and are apparently shooting at her while in this position, but still not a single shot hits her (but on the other hand Haruko also displays a superhuman ability to duck and weave through bullets and even slice them in half with a straight razor in midair.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, anyone who shoots at Scar will fail miserably, even Riza Hawkeye who is known for being a highly skilled sniper has only been able to graze him. However, he does put the lightning in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>.
</li><li> Momo Kawashima of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> is a horrible shot, despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy">enthusiasm</a>. Perhaps the most notable example was when Turtle team got to point blank range with the St. Gloriana's team, and she managed to fire <em>through the tiny gap between two tanks</em>.
</li><li> Happens a lot in the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series, where if you are not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> you can't hit a space colony while standing on it. <em>The 08th MS Team</em> had a hilarious instance of the hero utterly failing at marksmanship: as Shiro is sliding down a tower, he opens up on his enemy with every single machine gun the Gundam has on it... and misses spectacularly. His opponent remarks, "Well, that <em>looked</em> impressive."
<ul><li> Lampshaded by Zapper Zaku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce">SD Gundam Force</a></em> episode 19, when Zako Soldiers fail to hit Bakunetsumaru with missiles, even though he is preoccupied having a standoff with Ashuramaru. The missiles just whiz by them without hitting anything.
<div class="indent"><strong>Zapper:</strong> You <em>missed</em>, you idiots, and he's not even moving!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> has the Major. He utterly fails to hit a target slowly walking at him until his very last bullet. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As he dies, he chortles how happy he is to finally have hit his target.</span> His own minions don't understand how he managed to get into the SS being such a horrible shot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hol Horse. Bonus points for managing to shoot like crap while <strong>having the ability to control the direction of his bullets</strong>!
</li><li> Rohan Kishibe can apparently invoke this by using his stand to write "I cannot attack Rohan Kishibe" onto someone. After he does it to Koichi, he still tries by throwing projectiles, but subconsciously aims away from him every time.
</li><li> Guido Mista's backstory where he first invokes his stand. Three men shoot him but all of the bullets miss, even though he was at close range and virtually standing still<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, though only due to his stand, which gives him the ability to redirect bullets</span>. Mista then calmly picks up one of the mens' revolvers, loads it, and shoots all three of the men in the face. To top things off, the judge does not believe that a man could pick up a revolver in the crossfire without getting hit and sentences him to prison.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion">Kimba the White Lion</a></em>. The second episode has an exaggerated example where Kimba avoids the gunfire from a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfricanTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfricanTerrorists">African Terrorists</a> that is chasing the boat he is on by running towards them, ducking every now and again, and using the log that jammed the boat's wheel as a shield while removing the log.

<ul><li> From the second <em>Naruto Shippuuden</em> movie, the ninja of the Sky Country have gatling guns that fire kunai. Apparently they're a deadly force, but they just seem to land by peoples' feet more often than not. One of them almost hits Shizune's foot as it just barely misses Tsunade, but she just has to stand there. Then Sai fights several of them in the air and just stands atop his giant bird thinking to himself while a volley of kunai fly over his head. But then, perhaps this also involves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> tries to avoid this trope by having the navy use swords more often than using guns. Whenever the marines use guns on the Straw Hats, it's only against the stronger members that can easily dodge the bullets or disarm the snipers. If fighting the weaker members, they normally are too close and will be attacked by them or reasonably too far away to hit them. Worst of all is if the poor saps attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Luffy</a>, who often neglects to dodge the ammo and instead bounces it back.

</li><li> Amusingly enough, in the comic book crossover between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpyBoy">SpyBoy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, Robin actually asks Spy Boy's team if they indeed took the Stormtrooper Marksmanship course &mdash; never realizing that HE was also displaying Stormtrooper level of accuracy.
</li><li> Actually, the police forces and the military in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">DC</a> universes, as well as the government agencies, all seem to have attended this Academy. When you think of the number of times Doctor Octopus, Poison Ivy, the Green Goblin, etc. could have all been easily stopped by a police sniper doing what both had to be done <em>and</em> was legally justified and simply putting a round into a brain... Instead, you've got dozens of cops or soldiers emptying magazines and not hitting a damn thing. The exception is if they are firing at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">bulletproof</a> supervillain, in which case they will hit every shot just to prove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage">that guns are ineffective and a superhero will need to save the day.</a>
</li><li> Parodied in an old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a></em> magazine where the heroes of the story are escaping from an enemy castle and none of the archers are able to hit them. One of the archers becomes fed up, takes aim, and proceeds to kill all three of the heroes with the next three shots. His celebration is cut short when his commanding officer reprimands him for the deed, stating that they were all missing on purpose and that the story couldn't continue now that the protagonists were dead.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TwistedToyfareTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TwistedToyfareTheatre">Twisted Toyfare Theatre</a></em> issue, a bunch of troublemaking Stormtroopers of various types are forced to community service in a retirement home for the Empire's most honored veterans: The Clone Troopers.
<div class="indent"><strong>Stormtrooper:</strong> Wow, so you guys actually used to, you know, <em>hit things</em> with your guns? <br><strong>Clone Trooper:</strong> Oh, yeah. Jedi, droids, small children... One time I hit the broad side of a <em>barn!</em> <br><strong>Stormtrooper:</strong> <strong>Wow</strong>.
</div></li><li> AIMLESS (probably a parody of Marvel's AIM) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Normalman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Normalman">normalman</a></em>, a mysterious paramilitary organization under the thumb of the nefarious Cephalopod... well, their name says it all, really. They're all really poor marksmen, but it doesn't exactly matter since their nemesis, Sgt. Fluffy, Agent of S.C.H.M.U.C.K., is completely invulnerable to bullets. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or... is he? No, no he's not. Too bad <em>he</em> didn't know that when the Cephalopod got fed up with the indirect approach and decided to take care of the guy himself.</span>

<ul><li> By a similar token, Decepticon Targetmasters Misfire and Aimless. Misfire held the record for failure in the Decepticon Academy, and only passed because they needed every last soldier. Aimless, his gun, doesn't exactly help matters because he doesn't even <em>try</em>. Megatron actually sees potential in Misfire, however, saying that he's much more deadly than your average gunman because he's a danger to everything <em>except</em> his target. In any case, he's become a surprisingly useful soldier to officers who use his lack of ability in creative ways.
</li><li> Again, similarly, Strafe of the Technobots is inherently inaccurate. His targeting computer is defective, it's impossible for him to aim well... but tries to cover it up by saying things like "I shoot everywhere because that's where the enemies are."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em>:

They proceed to dump several rounds of ammo into the area until Lucky Luke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastingItOutOfTheirHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastingItOutOfTheirHands">disarms</a> them with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>.

And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">the lieutenant even refused to take cover!</a>
</li><li> Another story, <em>The Rivals of Painful Gulch</em>, features two feuding families who's been fighting for ages, but never wiped out each other since they were all such bad shots. At one point, the town undertaker even pleads for the hero, if he cannot bring peace between the families, to at least <em>teach them how to aim</em> so they can finish each other off. In the beginning of that story, the mayor is showing Luke around town when they come to a place where one member of the feuding families was cornered by three members of the opposing family. They had been firing at their victim for 15 minutes, but not a single shot hit. The wall at the spot is riddled with bullet holes everywhere, except for the place where their target stood.
</li><li> In one of the short stories, a young man tries to impress his girlfriend by convincing her that he is at the same level as Wyatt Earp, let alone Luke himself. The problem is, he is such a terrible shot that every bullet he fires goes <em>backwards</em>, hitting whatever target he has behind him (prompting Luke to take cover because he is standing behind him). At the end, this saves his reputation, because the bullets going the wrong way kills off a bank robber - he had the bank behind his back. It earns him the promotion to sheriff.

<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames">Rubin</a>:</strong> Poor fools! Don't you know us comic book characters are always missed when we run at the guns?

</li><li> "Marvel What-The" lampshades it (like 100 other comic tropes):
<div class="indent"> <strong>Wolverine Parody</strong>: How come they don't hit us? <br><strong>Punisher Parody</strong>: We got Good Guy bullets! They got the Bad Guy bullets!

He stands on the lawn picking off guys one by one while little squibs go off all around him. Also has him running <em>on an open field</em> while his enemies, maybe 30 meters behind him, shoot uselessly in his vague direction. Arnold, on the other hand, is the Anti-Stormtrooper in that movie, as he hits goons he's not even aiming at!

</li><li> A particularly egregious example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JetLi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JetLi">Jet Li</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DannyTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DannyTheDog">Danny the Dog</a></em>, during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raffles' ambush of Bart</span>.

</li><li> Parodied nicely by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2">Die Hard 2</a>: Die Harder</em>, where there's a massive fire fight outside a church between good guys and bad guys where nobody gets hurt despite the enormous amount of gunpowder being discharged. The fact is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were all shooting with blanks, since they were all bad guys</span>.

</li><li> Used straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FallingDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FallingDown">Falling Down</a></em>. A carful of thugs tries to kill the main character in a drive-by, spraying bullets everywhere and hit, but not kill about half a dozen pedestrians before dying in a car crash themselves.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourBrothers">Four Brothers</a></em>, Sweed's assassins have a huge advantage over the Mercer brothers in numbers and firepower. But they get slaughtered by the Mercers during the home shootout, mainly because most of them just stand out in the open and mindlessly "spray and pray" all their shots.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGauntlet">The Gauntlet</a></em>, Eastwood and costar Sondra Locke are in a bus, driving not very fast down a street lined with cop-mooks on both sides firing automatic weapons at the bus. The bus is shot full of holes, but neither Eastwood nor Locke are hit. This is more an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedArmor">Improvised Armor</a> compartment Eastwood's character builds around the driver's seat does take its share of hits. On the other hand, it does raise the question of why none of Phoenix's finest, virtually all 2900 of whom are lining the bus route, think to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">shoot out the tires.</a></em>

The Proton Pack's ion stream is, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, "a thousand times more powerful than a fire hose." It bucks and writhes about. Also, the idea is not to <em>hit</em> the ghost, but to get it running from the streams long enough to tire it out and corral it over the trap &mdash; the stream can't harm ghosts directly, but it can contain them long enough for the trap to do its thing.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entire U.S. military in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em>. Having lured out the title creature, an immense artillery barrage begins, firing at a target several stories tall. The small arms fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">may have been ineffective,</a> but several dozen missiles all miss from a range of half a block to a hundred feet or so. The missiles do manage to hit something, though. Namely, the Chrysler Building, after the giant reptile dodges them. The mayor of New York is not happy.
</li><li> Even in the original Japanese movies, the military were exceptionally bad shots. If you watch closely during some of the older movies, their missiles normally just fly right past Godzilla and his mates and hit the buildings. They probably caused more property damage then Godzilla did. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toho">Toho</a> seems to have caught on to this by the Heisei and Millennium films, so they make it where the military have 95% accuracy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">but still don't do any damage</a>.

And most of those gunfights are taking place indoors, at roughly 10-20 foot ranges. (If the Hornet's <em>not</em> involved, they're good shots.)
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeneralLuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeneralLuna">Heneral Luna</a></em> and its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoyoAngBatangHeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoyoAngBatangHeneral">Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral</a></em>, it is rare to find a scene wherein the Filipino soldiers actually hit anything, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save for the assassination of the titular general of the first film, done at close range</span>. It's justified in that all of them are poorly-trained conscripts during a time when the land wasn't united at all.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>, where Arthur, Trillian, Zaphod, and Marvin are surrounded by blaster-wielding Vogon soldiers. All of them take cover in Arthur's caravan except Marvin, who remarks, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">I don't know what all the fuss is about. Vogons are the worst marksmen in the universe</a>," and is immediately shot in the back of the head. This isn't a real accomplishment though, since this version of Marvin has a <em>huge</em> head, and gets back up after a minute. However, Marvin's tempting fate is justified by the fact that in all previous scenes of the movie where we see the Vogons shooting, they use weapons which have multiple barrels which shoot loads of laser blasts in every direction except towards the characters; the design is physically impossible to aim and lacks sights in any case. In fact, this one time where they hit Marvin is their only hit in the entire movie. Plus, they never would have made that hit if a less genre-savvy character hadn't screamed "don't hit the robot!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">The Nazis</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Thuggee cult</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">the Russians</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> films follow this trend, except for the shootout at Marion's bar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> (which involved locally hired henchmen, not Nazis). Also the Hovitos in the first film. Not one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">arrows or darts</a> hits Indy as he flees the jungle. Not that they seemed able to aim well in the first place.
</li><li> Common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> films. Bond frequently walks alone into a massive group of enemies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">AKA47s</a> of some description, carrying nothing but his trusty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handguns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handguns">Walther PPK</a>, and caps every single one of them with precise single shots whilst they all blaze away and hit nothing but air, or with extreme accuracy, any metal railings between Bond and the gun.
<ul><li> Averted just <em>once</em>, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball">Thunderball</a></em>, where Bond gets shot in the leg trying to lose pursuers in the Junkanoo parade. It's not even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a>, to add insult to that.
</li><li> Eric Kriegler from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForYourEyesOnly">For Your Eyes Only</a></em> is an Olympic biathlon competitor, who gets the drop on 007 with a rifle, and <em>still</em> can't hit him. This may possibly be justified since Kriegler, as a biathlon competitor, would have been used to hitting a stationary target, rather than a middle-aged Englishman careening down an alpine slope. When Bond takes cover and tries to retrieve his fallen pistol, Kriegler is able to shoot his ski pole in half at a decent distance.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace">Quantum of Solace</a></em> Bond's car and the bad guy's drive side-by-side for several seconds. The bad guy riddles Bond's car with bullets but never touches Bond. The cars separate. Bond retrieves his own machine gun. The other car comes back into view. Bond immediately puts three bullets into the bad guy, killing him instantly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></em>, Bond uses his PPK in conjunction with a captured MP5 SMG for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">suppressive fire</a>. A good portion of the climax is both of them forcing the baddies to keep their heads down.
</li><li> In the chase sequence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em>, Bond and his hostage run desperately through an embassy with lots of enemy troops firing on them. Bond is going all out with tactics and hand-to-hand to avoid being shot, and the troops outside can't see very well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>: Pretty evident during Bond and Madeline's escape from the SPECTRE base in Morocco, where Bond mows down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> left and right without getting so much as a scratch. Particularly noticeable since when Bond breaks cover he steps completely out into the open rather than lean out from behind cover.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> justifies this to a certain extent in an early scene, with Dredd pointing out to the other Judges (who are hiding behind cover while Dredd is out in the open) that despite the large quantity of gunfire coming down around him, apparently they're well beyond the manufacturer-listed "lethal range" for the guns that are being used, and so Dredd doesn't see the need to hide.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>: The movie would have ended halfway through if the veteran soldier with the Gatling gun had been able to hit the sixty foot long I. Rex. And if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mercenaries</span> could hit raptors charging straight at them at close range when they have automatic weapons and night vision sights. Possibly justified in some areas in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> since the I. Rex was secretly designed to be a living weapon for military use, it would be built to be able to withstand certain weaponry, especially ones not meant for war let alone non-lethal ones like in the former scenario</span>.
</li><li> In the DVD commentary of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingdom">The Kingdom</a></em>, the director mentions that he asked a group of ex-special forces people watching a preview if it wasn't a bit too implausible that none of the good guys were getting hit by the terrorists in the final shootout. They assured him that such lousy accuracy was nothing unusual. You can see in that movie how often the special forces take position and then aim deliberately while the untrained terrorists just point their guns in the general direction and fire.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></em>: Valentine's mooks empty magazine after magazine at Eggsy, but they don't miss; his suit is bulletproof. A deleted clip shows him shrugging off a ton of flattened bullets. All of them do, however, manage to miss his unprotected head.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadyVanishes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadyVanishes">The Lady Vanishes</a></em> inadvertently draws attention to this by letting the villains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposablePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposablePilot">kill the train conductors</a> with one shot each. Naturally, the only other good guy who gets shot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalPacifism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalPacifism">makes a blatant target of himself</a></span>.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a></em>. An entire squad of mercs with assault rifles and fancy night-vision equipment break into Lara's mansion and somehow never manage to shoot her as she's jumping and running around, taking them out with karate kicks. She does have the home-field advantage and a fancy trapeze - which obviously isn't a standard combat scenario - but her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection">Voice with an Internet Connection</a> lives in a trailer. The bad guys block the door, then shoot at it when he tries to get out - except they don't shoot at the actual door, just around it. They even manage to shoot the Pepsi can <em>next</em> to his computer, (and then he ducks down). They don't cut the cables to the mansion's security system from the trailer, and for some reason like to fight hanging from cords in the air where they'd be big sitting ducks instead of on the ground where they'd have some cover and concealment, or just march into the trailer and execute the guy.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em> are utterly incapable of hitting anything with their automatic weapons (in 1899!), except for some old men in Kenya at the start of the film. Also applies to Secret Service Agent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfTomSawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfTomSawyer">Sawyer</a>. You'd think marksmanship would be something a Secret Service agent would need to pass before being sent into the field. Instead, he prefers the same spray'n'pray approach as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>. One of the story arcs is Quartermain teaching Sawyer how to shoot the proper way - by aiming and leading the target. Naturally, this ends up being useful when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quartermain has been stabbed, and Sawyer is the one who has to shoot Moriarty in the back of the head from quite a distance away</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeftForDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeftForDead">Left for Dead</a></em>, Goldie unloads her sixgun at Mobius when he suddenly appears and starts slowly advancing towards her, and misses with every shot. She panics and claims that he is bulletproof, but Clem angrily snaps back that she just missed. As it turns out, Morbius is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth">but Goldie had no way of knowing that</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> has this. In the book, it's not made clear how accurate orcs are with bows and arrows, yet in the movies it's apparent that you won't get hit unless you're heir to the line of Stewards of Gondor. They're actually shown to be quite competent marksmen in the books, both at shooting down fleeing enemies at Cirith Ungol and when a scout orc shoots an arrow into the eye of a warrior Uruk after an argument, killing him. Although for some reason, their marksmanship isn't quite good enough to hit Faramir fatally in either battle at Osgiliath in which he's involved, even though everyone else dies on the second attempt.
</li><li> The Musketeers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManInTheIronMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManInTheIronMask">The Man in the Iron Mask</a></em>. Justified in that they were shooting with their eyes closed, so that they wouldn't have to see the original Three Musketeers die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>:

</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">Iron Man</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Obadiah Stane</span> has difficulty hitting Tony Stark in the final battle because Tony had disabled his targeting computers. Though due to the Iron Man armour being bulletproof, most of the time bad guys are a pretty good shot. An improbably good shot in the case of the tank.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>, as the agents chase the heroes through the program, they fire repeatedly but are unable to inflict more than minor wounds except when shooting at point-blank range.

In O'Bannon's case it makes some sense as he's a lot more talk than he is ability; but he HAS shown some gun skill in the film, yet his shots are hilariously wild and off the mark, never hitting <em>anything</em>. Van Cleef, however, is meant to be a highly skilled and ruthless killer of bandits. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">O'Bannon ends up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft">one last bullet</a> while Van Cleef has two full revolvers, every single shot of which misses, if just barely.

Hartigan notes that he <em>is</em> a good shot, but says he's missing because he's throwing away bullets, and not taking the time to aim.

During the "escape from prison" sequence, the only shot of the evil stormtroopers which hits true is one which just barely singes Princess Vespa's hair.

Also spoofed earlier in the movie when "Gunner's Mate First Class Phillip Asshole" is asked to fire across the nose of Princess Vespa's ship, and almost hits her. When told "I said across her nose, not up it!", it is revealed that the gunner is cross-eyed. As is the rest of his family (most of which are on the crew), prompting this quote:

<ul><li> The Remans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekNemesis">Star Trek: Nemesis</a></em> are supposedly the fearsome shocktroops of the Romulan Star Empire, and yet an army of them pursue Picard and Data through their ship for several minutes without hitting either of them.

The Romulans can't hit anything, while Kirk and Spock are wasting them with precise shots. However, these Romulans are former miners with no military education and just barely got out 25 years on Rura Penthe, while Kirk and Spock are Starfleet and trained in combat and tactics. It can be assumed that marksmanship is a requirement for any Starfleet officer.
</li><li> Somewhat less justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em>, when four main characters go up against an entire squad of Klingon warriors.

<ul><li> The Imperial Stormtroopers are notorious, even among many non-<em>Star Wars</em> fans, for their inability to hit the heroes, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>. This reputation is enhanced by how in the former Obi-Wan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">makes a point of what incomparably good shots they're supposed to be</a>, and in the latter the Emperor refers to the scouts on Endor as his "best troops". In the prequel trilogy, the standard battle droids are arguably even worse than the Stormtroopers, while, oddly enough, the Clone Troopers (predecessors of the Stormtroopers) tend to be much better shots than the Stormtroopers. A lot of ink has been spilled on this subject, both in official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> publications and by fans and critics, either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> or attempting to rationalize this shoddy marksmanship. Ironically, there <em>are</em> several plausible in-universe explanations, and not just <em>ad hoc</em> ones either. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">here</a> for a more detailed analysis.
</li><li> The whole "stormtroopers can't shoot on target" thing is so infamous that there are now many jokes about it. For example, "A Stormtrooper and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> get into a firefight. The Stormtrooper misses all the shots. The Red Shirt dies anyway".
<ul><li> It's also a favorite subject matter for jokes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/RiffTrax">RiffTrax</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DweMrG7vZG8">Here's a compilation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly in the two instances most often used as examples of their ineptitude (the Death Star escape, and the Cloud City rescue) the Stormtroopers are under orders <em>not</em> to kill the heroes, as Vader wants them alive for various reasons. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> doesn't have such a justification and they noticeably manage to hit both R2 and Leia, albeit non-lethally.
</li><li> Also, we see instances of Stormtroopers being very lethal. They took the Blockade Runner &mdash; a fortified position through a choke point &mdash; routing the enemy with very few casualties.
</li><li> It's worth noting that the Stormtroopers' blasters have a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_(firearms)">folding stock<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but it was never used in the original trilogy.
</li><li> In the special edition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalSelfDefense">Greedo misses Han while he is sitting across a tiny TABLE from him</a>. They tried to fix it later by having Han dodge it, which raises all kinds of other issues. Since Han shot Greedo in the original without Greedo ever taking a shot on his own, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> allows for some logical handwaving. One of the better choices is that Han would draw a bigger bounty alive than dead (Boba Fett said as much to Vader in Cloud City) so Greedo's shot was a deliberate near-miss to scare Han into compliance.
</li><li> The Battle Droids from films 1-3 can only hit anything when in formations that number in the thousands. EU sources indicate this was an <em>intentional design feature</em>, the Neimoidian didn't want an army that would be effective against them if they were hacked or rebelled. (Also, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">built on the cheap to impose</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">superiority through numbers</a>.) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">other droids</a> are much more accurate.
</li><li> Averted with the 501st Legion, Darth Vader's formation of clones/stormtroopers named after the fan club. This is because the legion does not take on recruits after the Empire opened up the ranks and remains purely composed of clone troops, who are much better shots.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> the only First Order Stormtrooper that does any better than their predecessors is the ex-Stormtrooper Finn.

</li><li> When asked about it, Pablo Hidalgo explained that Storm Troopers are not uniformly trained. Elite units like the 501st can wreck their opponents, while non-elite can be comparatively clumsy.
</li><li> Averted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomTroops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomTroops">Death Troopers</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em>, they retained the brutal efficiency of how a Stormtrooper is supposed to be and are known for scoring <em>numerous</em> kill counts of the rebels as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">two of the main casts</a>, Baze and Chirrut</span>. They still use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a> more generally, though.
</li><li> In the few scenes where we actually see them fighting, generic Rebel soldiers are even worse. In the Tantive IV battle that opens the franchise the door frame takes more hits than the troopers filing out of it do.

This despite the fact that the bandits are a lot more familiar with using guns than the villagers. The villagers were all dressed like the Amigos to mess with the banditos' heads, and were picking them off from random locations, then ducking out of sight before they the bad guys could get a bead on them.

<ul><li> This trope is played with quite deftly with the character of English Bob. When we first see him, he displays quite a bit of aptitude with a pistol during a pheasant shooting contest (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">on a moving train, no less</a>).

The character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Little Bill</a> soon reveals this to be false. According to him, Bob just happened to be drinking in the bar that Corky walked into and took a shot at him and missed because he was so drunk. Corky gets startled and shoots himself in the foot trying to draw his (only) gun. Bob carefully aims his second shot, but misses again because he is that damn drunk. Corky recovers, takes his time and aims carefully, but the gun blows up in his hand. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Bob only lands a shot when Corky is wounded and defenseless.</a>

<ul><li> There was an urban legend that went something like this: In 1971 a marshal and a general in Uruguay decided to settle a conflict the old fashioned way; with a gun duel. After standing back to back, they walked twelve steps, turned around, and started shooting. First once. Then twice. Nothing happened. They ended up firing 37 shots each <strong>without</strong> hitting each other before the duel stopped by itself due to the lack of ammo. The explanation the men gave? They forgot to put on their glasses, apparently. <br><br>Another variation of this story has an alternate ending: After seeing that all their shots missed, they decided to call off the duel and shake hands.

<ul><li> Until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">last book</a>, the Death Eaters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series were generally poor shots, although with wands rather than guns. Actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Half-Blood Prince</a></em> in which Harry's friends happened to have all taken a rare luck potion before the Death Eaters showed up, which is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneShotRevisionism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneShotRevisionism">One-Shot Revisionism</a>. Since, unlike guns, wands can do more than just kill, there's a <em>Harry Potter</em>-specific corollary to this trope, which we shall define thusly: "the more deadly and/or permanent the curse is, the less likely it is to hit its target."
</li><li> This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, whenever the Yeerks (human- and Hork-Bajir-Controllers) fire Dracon beams at the Animorphs, they will usually (but not always) miss. In book 29, Visser Three even yells "Would it be asking too much for one of you to actually hit something?!!" (although in that particular case, they were trying to shoot a bird in flight in a cavern.

<ul><li> Very often subverted in the books, especially when the protagonist is on the same side or at least neutral towards the Empire. It is not completely uncommon to see the Stormtroopers really are the best of the best. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a> novels in particular tend to portray Stormtroopers (and other Imperial personnel) as highly competent professionals.
</li><li> Subverted and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a>: Invincible</em>. Jaina Solo and Boba Fett are defending Roche against an Imperial assault. The stormtroopers first shoot Boba's gun, causing him to raise his hand, then blow a hole through it. Jaina is thinking "these weren't her mother's stormtroopers."
</li><li> <em>Imperial Commando:501st</em>, the final book in the Karen Traviss <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepublicCommandoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepublicCommandoSeries">Republic Commando Series</a></em> explains why the Clone Troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Imperial Stormtroopers are on polar opposite ends of the spectrum where accuracy is concerned: the clones that served in the Clone Wars were solely sourced from Kamino, using a process that takes ten years to produce a fully matured clone. Shortly before the rise of the Empire, Palpatine ordered the creation of lower quality clones sourced from various other sources including a facility on Coruscant&#146;s moon, that would be ready in less than a year. These <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration">lower quality clones</a> couldn&#146;t hit the broad side of a barn, but they would help fill the ranks. Curiously, at least one of these clones was assigned to the Imperial Commando Special Unit of the 501st legion, which was initially formed from the especially badass Clone Commandos and ARC Troopers who had survived the Clone War.

After all, individual blaster shots are cheap, blasters have no kick to throw off your aim while you bring the weapon to bear, and blaster shots flying all over the place tend to panic your enemies (who are now generally trouble-makers and law-breakers instead of battle-hardened enemy soldiers).

Orcs are incompetent soldiers but are known to be good shots with arrows throughout the literature; however, during the Battle of Helm's Deep, thousands of Uruk-hai rain down what are described as black clouds of arrows on the Rohirrim defenders... and very, very few even get injured, let alone killed.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimDorsey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimDorsey">Tim Dorsey</a> novel, this happens for justifiable reasons in an incident that is largely irrelevant to the plot.

Biggles explains that most anti-aircraft gunners never hit anything as they aim directly at where they see the plane, and by the time the shell reaches the target, it has moved on.

</li><li> Lampshaded and justified in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> when a Nightsider dragging Harper and Trance along asks why the bounty hunters shooting at them only seem to be aiming for him. Trance then reveals that her and Harper are wearing personal High Guard ECM generators that prevent smart bullets from locking on. The Nightsider thanks her and promptly confiscates Harper's bracelet. It's easy to imagine the look Harper gives Trance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>. Every episode features a gun battle with every character, hero and villain, emptying hundreds of thousands of rounds at each other &mdash; and no-one ever got shot. This was because <em>The A-Team</em> was nominally a kid's show in prime time. At the time, it was overlooked due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, but now it's amazingly funny to consider the A-Team were a bunch of Vietnam War Special Ops veterans who couldn't hit their targets at all. A popular interpretation is that the good guys, at least, missed <em>on purpose</em>, following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">the trope named after them</a>. They never wanted to hurt anybody, they only wanted to make the bad guys <em>think</em> they were going to hurt them.
</li><li> The Cylons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">Battlestar Galactica (1978)</a></em> &mdash; killer combat robots that almost wiped out the entire human race &mdash; couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with their toes up against the shingles. The silver Cylon robots were the dumbest type and they almost always reacted the same way to the same type of attack. The humans could usually guess which way they would turn in a battle and shoot where they were going to be. Watch a space battle and you can see that the vipers don't shoot at the cylon ships, but at where they will be. The same could be said about gun fights with hand guns. At one time, it was common in some BG and SW fan circles to refer to the "Imperial/Cylon School of Gunnery" to refer to the lack of accuracy of both Stormtroopers and the original Centurions &mdash; except when the plot called for them to actually hit someone (e.g., to kill Serena). Reference to the School was generally followed by the tag-line "Could not hit the side of a Death Star."
</li><li> The ones from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em> are hardly expert shots, though it's not like they were needed to nuke the colonies to extinction. The sentient Raiders suffer this pretty badly it would seem with one notable exception, which became well known even among the human fleet. Considering in almost every engagement the human pilots, flying 40-year-old machines remember, are extremely outnumbered and have a very limited number of people they can call up, casualties are usually very light compared to what they should be were the Raiders any good. It's possible that despite death being "a learning experience" for the Raiders, they just did not learn anything so long as they had the ability to resurrect. The humanoid Cylons may have figured this out given later episodes of the first half of season 4 showed some had been training as colonial style pilots.

They each take one, go out to the firing range, and miss. There's even a montage just showing dozens of impacts on the padded area behind the paper targets. The justification is that flintlock pistols were often inaccurate, and the ones used were worse than most. Not only that, the cop right next to Castle goes to help him after all Castle's shots kept messing with his own target practice. This goes from the cop giving Castle stable platforms to shoot from, to strapping a scope and a laser pointer on the pistol, taping it down zeroed on the center of the target and pulling the trigger with a string. Still misses, with the only hit being to the target <em>next</em> to the one aimed for. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is all used to prove that the weapon was highly unlikely to have been the murder weapon. In fact, the two guys specifically dueled with them in order to "satisfy their honor" without anyone actually being harmed. The real culprit is someone using a modern smoothbore weapon with an old-fashioned steel ball.</span>

A woman shoots a man standing two feet away but he survives with only a minor wound. Everyone initially assumes that the man was lucky and the woman was a poor shot. However, the FBI later finds out that she is actually a highly trained sniper with no qualms about killing bystanders. The 'lucky victim' was actually her accomplice and she was such a good shot that she was able to shoot him in a way that made it look like this trope was in play. This caused the FBI to seriously underestimate her capabilities and, until Cameron figures out the scheme, removed all suspicion from he accomplice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted in the new series with the Daleks, who land almost every shot they make with pinpoint precision, and miss very rarely and only in highly chaotic situations. This fits their characterization as omnicidal EX-TER-MIN-ATORS, and guarantees that anyone, even heroic characters, foolish enough to fight them openly is going to be dead in short order. Even <em>the Doctor himself</em> has been tagged by their shots when any other villain would have played the trope straight.

<ul><li> There are mooks that are both hilariously incompetent and amazingly adept shots. One particular standout moment is in the final shootout in the pilot, where Mal and Zoe are standing in the open, against a numerically superior enemy force and with no cover. When the gunfight starts up, Zoe gets hit dead center in the chest, but Mal only gets winged, even when he's standing only a dozen meters away and only walking slowly forward and sideways. On the other hand, Rance Burgess' collection of militia and goons can hit prostitutes firing back at them from a good twenty to thirty meters away behind cover, firing rifles one-handed, on the backs of moving horses.

While they&#146;re waiting, one notices a piece of refuse nearby and decides to try to shoot it with his hold out blaster. He and the other trooper both fire multiple times at it and neither manage to hit their target.
<ul><li> This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in this case, since, if you pay close attention, their shots vary widely from where their guns are aimed, implying that Stormtrooper <em>equipment</em> may be shoddy (probably due to the blasters' age, as the Empire was defeated five years earlier), instead of the Stormtroopers themselves. It's also worth noting that one of the troopers shakes his pistol and it makes a rattling sound. As anybody who has dealt with precision weaponry can attest, loose parts inside a weapon is a sign that something is seriously wrong with it.

</li><li> In a later episode, Charlie redeems himself by at least being competent enough to drop propaganda fliers on the camp.
</li></ul></li><li> It's noted that at least one of the snipers that attacked the unit - the one who had an entire episode dedicated to his siege of the camp - was nothing more than a scared kid with a rifle. Doesn't excuse the sheer number of misses (only one person is hit, and dozens and dozens of rounds are fired) but it explains it to a degree.

They give the order to fire, and everyone misses. They try a few more times, and everyone misses again. The officer tries to give advice about how to aim, but they still miss. The last time, the Russian soldiers just decide to bayonet the man, and he survives, although the audience doesn't know how, because the scene cuts to a title card labeled "Scene Missing" followed by the bicycler exclaiming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">"What an amazing escape!"</a>

On average, each shot from a Stormtrooper's blaster is calculated to be between 130-135 mph (209-217 km/h). Despite testing from both ready and holstered positions, the shots were proven much too fast to dodge. Maybe the Stormtroopers really are blind.
</li><li> In the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>, the would-be-terrorist brings a machine gun to bear on Gibbs... firing it single-handedly, starting from the hip and going up. The distance he misses by is almost the width of the Air Force One corridor they were in. (Gibbs, by contrast, puts 2 rounds from a semi-auto square in his chest, dropping him to his knees, followed by a third to flatten him. Game over.)

</li></ul></li><li> In the pilot of BBC's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em>, several guards miss shooting an escaping Robin and his group when they are galloping towards them!
</li><li> The Jaffa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. Well, at least when they're evil. A Jaffa's aim gets <em>much</em> better after turning to the good side. They do have those bulky staff weapons, but good Jaffa seem to be pretty proficient with them. In the episode "The Warrior", O'Neill hangs a lampshade on this by describing the staff weapon as "a weapon of terror: it's made to intimidate the enemy." and compares it with the P-90, a submachine gun which he says is "a weapon of war: it's made to kill the enemy." He then goes on to demonstrate that the power and accuracy of a staff weapon is pitiful compared to the P-90. That would make this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, if it weren't for the sheer number of times SG-1 manage to escape unharmed despite being shot at by an army of Jaffa at close range.
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a></em> villains have terrible aim. When anyone starts shooting at Starsky or Hutch, they almost always miss, no matter how easy the shot is.
</li><li> In the episode introducing the Borg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, the captain orders the enemy ship's tractor beam to be destroyed. Multiple phaser shots are then fired with no apparent attempt to aim at the tractor beam, and inflicts minimal damage on random spots of the enemy ship. Only the last shot lands squarely on the tractor beam and destroys it.
</li><li> The live action <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTeddyRuxpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTeddyRuxpin">Teddy Ruxpin</a> special lampshades and invokes this. One character states, when the cannon fire begins, that the bad guy is the worst shot in the world, and that as long as he's trying to blow up the cabin, the cabin is the safest place they could be.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUmbrellaAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUmbrellaAcademy">The Umbrella Academy</a> </em>: Hazel, Cha-Cha, and the unnamed mooks fire hundreds of rounds at close range without hitting anybody. Particularly egregious at the bowling alley, where they are unable to take down people running in straight lines down the bowling lanes.
<ul><li> Exaggerated in season two, where the siblings are attacked by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hundreds of Comission mooks</span>, all wielding rifles, yet <em>none</em> of them are so much as grazed by bullets. It makes even less sense with Five and Diego, who are only a few feet away away when the battle begins and have to run about a hundred meters in an open field to get to cover, and Five is too tired to teleport.
</li><li> The Swedes go after Diego and Lila at the asylum, with two of them toting automatic weapons. They open fire when they catch Diego and Lila in a narrow hallway. Exactly none of them land a shot.
</li></ul></li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SyFy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SyFy">SyFy</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>, this was brought up as the agents had target practice. Steve said something to the effect of "It's not this difficult to fire a ray gun in movies" to which Pete replied "Actually it's very difficult to fire a raygun in the movies. The stormtroopers hardly hit anything."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>: While the gangbangers may have access to firearms and not be shy about using them, they don't really know much about <em>shooting accurately</em>. A prime and tragic example is in Season 2, where Bodie's crew and another gang unload dozens of rounds at each other in a running shootout. The only resulting damage is a bunch of shattered car windows... and a little boy in an upstairs bedroom who gets a stray bullet through the head. Most of the bangers don't even aim properly when they shoot, and have their eyes closed when they pull the trigger. The only real exception is Marlo Stanfield's crew, as Marlo often takes his men out into the woods for target practice.

</li><li> This will also inevitably get played straight in a realistic campaign involving untrained shooters (such as civilians with stolen guns or insurgents): shooting an average gun without any points in the Guns skill means that you roll at DX-4. The average human score for any stat is 10, so an average human with zero training needs a whole lot of luck to hit the target in combat conditions. (This increases at point blank range or during a careful range session, of course.) Even for professional soldiers, range and vision penalties and various other factors (such as being under suppression fire at the time) can heavily reduce accuracy. In an ultra-realistic campaign where one or two bullets can take even a PC out of the game, making everyone a terrible shot is often the only way to keep everyone alive.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsLegion">Star Wars: Legion</a></em> may feature Stormtroopers as the key unit of the Empire's armies, but it zigzags this trope a bit. On one hand, Stormtrooper attacks roll white dice, which makes them generally inaccurate especially when compared to the Rebel Trooper's black dice. On the other hand, the Stormtrooper's DLT-19 heavy weapon is a long range rifle that rolls red dice, making it far more accurate than the Rebel's white dice rolling equivalent, the Z-6. In addition, Stormtroopers unlike Rebel Troopers have an attack surge to hits, and also possess the 'Precise' keyword which makes aim tokens more powerful. Both of these abilities combined gives them a little more accuracy than their white dice imply at a glance.

Sand People on Mos Eisley in Hunt mode. If the Sand People had a modicum of intellect and some power of aiming, their sniper rifles would give them a tremendous advantage over the Jawas' lightning guns, but as-is it is nearly impossible to win that map single player as the Sand People, because the A.I. is so horrible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in universe, however. The Sand People eschew technology aside from what they can scavenge and use against invaders. That means they're using guns that have probably spent too long in the sand, baking in the Tattooine suns, and weren't trained to fight with firearms past "point and shoot."

They pose a big threat in numbers and when not dispatched quickly. Especially in the higher difficulties.
<ul><li> A databank entry exists in the sequel on the common Stormtrooper, which was authored by none other than Clone Commander Cody, his glory days of serving along side General Kenobi long behind him, now stuck on Kamino leading the birth-born recruits that guard the cloning facility of Timira City.

The whole sequence is narrated by one of the Kaminoan cloners, but if you ignore her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">pay attention to what's going on in the background</a>, you actually get to see one of the mass-produced clone troopers at a firing range. He is literally five paces away from his target drone, which is in a small, enclosed shooting alcove, and is hitting everything <em>but</em> the target. These guys are on your side, but obviously they will become the core of the Stormtrooper corps later. Also in the game, B1 battle droids appear en masse and can't hit the broad side of a clone commando at almost point blank range. it's not unusual for you or one of your fellow commandos to run right up to one without taking a hit and take it apart with your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VibroWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VibroWeapon">vibro-knuckler blade</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediFallenOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediFallenOrder">Jedi Fallen Order</a></em> completely averts this trope to the point where you have to wonder why the Empire never sent <em>these</em> troops after the heroes. Stormtroopers are incredibly accurate here, as they <em>will</em> hit you at any range if you fail to dodge or deflect their shots. On top of this, you'll even encounter them en masse with Scout and Purge troopers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">Friendly Fireproof</a> is in effect in these instances, as they will always hit you, but never their allies unless they're using rocket launchers.

On the Novice setting, bots often miss virtually point blank shots with hitscan weapons. On Godlike, bots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">can land headshots from all the way across the map immediately after turning around to face the player</a>.

After defeating her in a boss fight, however, the ensuing cutscene shows her missing her shots at Dante even as he <em>walks</em> closer and closer to her. Possibly justified if you cut her some slack for the massive loss of blood.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, Sunblade Lookouts are placed in such a position in order to shoot down anyone attempting to make a bombing run along the Dead Scar of the Isle of Quel'danas. While they do respond to each threat with an impressive volley of flaming arrows, they simply couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if it painted a bullseye onto itself. Who said that elves are good archers?
</li><li> The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> gives you a percentage chance (which is usually believable) to hit any specific limb of the enemy. Should you miss that limb, your shot will miss the enemy altogether. Two things make this worse: first, even if the enemy is <em>shoving his head into the barrel of the gun</em>, your character still has that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalMiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalMiss">5% chance of missing</a> (there is no guaranteed hit in VATS). Second: if you somehow (*cough*cheater*cough*) manage to have enough Action Points to have a long series of attacks, it still uses the exact probabilities given to you when you set up your shot sequence, even if the enemy has managed to <em>get out from behind cover, walk right in front of the player, and done everything short of sticking his/her/its finger-analogue down the gun's barrel</em>. Want to hit that person right in front of you? Don't use VATS. Concentrated Fire gives your character a 5% higher to-hit chance for each consecutive time you target a limb in VATS. Without cheats, this can give your last shot a 71% chance to hit an enemy from 10 kilometres away.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Averted in the sequel</a>; the hilarious miss chance is meant to lull your enemies into a false sense of security while your ultimate charges. Said ultimate is a wall-hacking aimbot super-crit, as in, it <strong>never</strong> misses, laws of physics be damned. You can also <em>store</em> ultimate charges with the right perk and use them whenever you want.

They tended to have better aim at moving targets, but that follows this trope closely anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, when the Shinra soldiers are firing at Barret and Dyne and Scarlet yells at them "Kyaa haa, ha!! You can shoot all day and never hit them with an aim like that." Then quickly subverted when one of them manages to hit Dyne.
</li><li> At the beginning of its PSP prequel, <em>Crisis Core</em>, Zack is speaking to his mentor about his current mission on a cellphone, while being fired at by a squad of soldiers. The fact that he's perfectly apathetic to the gunfire and calmly speaks on the phone before killing them just shows how much Shinra soldiers suck. Sure, it was a virtual reality mission, but still, that means Shinra programs virtual representations of their own grunts with the faith that they couldn't hit a mark bigger than Mt. Fuji if the fate of their company would depend on it.
</li><li> Rafa and Malak in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> have skills that are horrifyingly inaccurate. They fire off one to six times, but there is an extremely high chance of the attacks only firing off once, on a spot completely off your intended target. The kicker? <em>They're trained assassins.</em> One has to wonder just how ineffective the rest of Barrington's military forces are... Reis, as a human, has a similar skill that fires only up to four attacks over an area up to thirteen tiles wide. Yeah. Good luck hitting anything with that. The Hydra family has two similar skills that tend to be MUCH more accurate due to that it's easy to limit the number of panels it can target (and thus are actually usable some of the time), so nobody knows why these special character skills are worse than what a generic monster can perform.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight as an arrow in any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> game. A.I. accuracy is terrible more than a few meters away, while your weapons seem to fire magical homing bullets. That is, until you play on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Veteran</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">difficulty</a>. In later games, it depends on who you are fighting (whether they depend on quantity or quality to overwhelm you). Random Viet Congs and Guerrillas play this straight since their main challenge is that there are a crapload of them firing at you, but averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> such as Spetsnaz commandos who are deadly accurate, and can shoot you in the face from across the yard right after performing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryCombatRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryCombatRoll">Unnecessary Combat Roll</a> (even on early missions!) and requires you to take cover regularly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a></em>, the chase scenes. They blow up some serious crap, bring along a couple of ships, and soldiers appear within breathing distance of you, but they'll most likely miss, <em>even when you're leisurely climbing a box at a snail's pace.</em> Subverted/averted with the turret-laser that is present on levels that require stealth to pass. No matter where you are and what obstacle is between you and it, if Jade's detected, that laser will hit and kill you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mooks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgentUnderFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgentUnderFire">Agent Under Fire</a></em> are like this. It's not <em>entirely</em> their fault as each and every one of the numerous automatic weapons they employ have <em>horrendous</em> accuracy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeLongRangeWeapon">past five meters or so</a>, and they can usually hit reliably with most handguns... after a few shots... assuming they live that long.
</li><li> This trope can be played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye</a> 64</em>. Unlocking the 007 difficulty allows players to manually determine the enemy's accuracy before starting a mission. When set to the lowest value, it's possible to stand point-blank in front on an enemy wielding an assault rifle for almost an entire minute, and he won't get a single hit.
</li></ul></li><li> The lesser enemies in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis">Time Crisis</a></em> series are often like this, but when you're about to get hit in the later games, a "Crisis Sight" is shown. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> (such as red soldiers) almost always score a hit on the first or second shot.
</li><li> Most gunpowder-based units and siege weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires">Age of Empires</a></em> are quite inaccurate. Trebuchets are probably the best example of this; they do huge amounts of damage, but seem to miss just as often as they hit. Siege weapons are meant for attacking stationary targets i.e. builds, except for the onagers which are short range anti-infantry/ship. They don't really have the projectile velocity to hit a moving target but once you've gotten them in range will nail builds every time (there is a tiny variation, but unless your attacking a house you'll never miss). Hand cannons are more truth in television as those era firearm ares were horribly inaccurate due to the way it was held, no rifling, variable quality gunpowder, and inconsistently shaped projectiles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlefieldHeroes">Battlefield Heroes</a></em>, the Commando's sniper rifles are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9i3oeXqMdU">so inaccurate when they're not zoomed in<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that it is actually possible to hit something <em>behind</em> the player.
</li><li> Alfred Ashford in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica">Resident Evil &#150; Code: Veronica</a></em> can't seem to snipe a target to save his life. Ditto for Annette in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em>, who suffers from this when she tries to shoot Ada in the sewers, although she accidentally hits Leon when he jumps in the way.
</li><li> Soldiers in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM">X-COM</a></em> games are notoriously bad shots. Given that skills grow in proportion with their successful use, constant misses can result in even worse accuracy. Unfortunately, the aliens suffer a lot less from this than the soldiers. Interestingly, given the game mechanics, you never have a 100% chance of hitting anything. At most, the chance is always 95%. This means that, even if the target is right in front of the soldier, there is still a 1 in 20 chance he will miss. Furthermore, since a 'miss' means your bullet is fired at a tile adjacent to your actual target, you can miss your target by <em>up to 45 degrees</em>.
<ul><li> Played straight and subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">remake</a>: Rookies have horrid aiming at targets in cover (and horrid aim against targets in the open, too) but if you manage to flank an enemy and negate their cover, your soldiers get a sizable accuracy boost. Even better, being point blank can grant not only a 100% chance to hit, but up to a 60% chance to critically hit.
</li></ul></li><li> Enemies in the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> games can't hit you until the Danger meter fills up. Which it does much faster on the Hard difficulty.
</li><li> Even on Impossible difficulty, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em>'s mooks have pretty lame accuracy at long range, not counting snipers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>.
</li><li> A playable example happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>. James has never held a gun before in his life, so he's a crap shot at it, being incapable of hitting a non-boss enemy from a room's length. With his flashlight off, you're lucky if you can hit a mannequin at arm's length. When he gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">hunting rifle</a> this changes, though the ammo is so limited that the only enemy you'd use it against is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Pyramid Head</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Mary</a></span>, both of which are fought in an arena.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1">Silent Hill</a></em>, Kaufmann shoots at Harry from an arm's length away in a fairly well lit room and fails to hit him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>: On Arrae, Cerberus troopers repeatedly fail to hit several slowly moving targets ten feet away during a cutscene. This is especially jarring since the average Cerberus soldier can shoot the wings off of a fly in normal gameplay, especially on Insanity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em>, this trope affects the run-of-the-mill Nazi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, but not the female SS Paranormal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">deadly accurate</a> even with automatic weapons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em>, there is a solo mission called "The Duel" where if you play in Special Agent or higher, you will face against a Jonathan simulant and pretty much his aim is so terrible that no matter how close you are to him, he will ALWAYS miss you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a> Zero</em>, Maihem is the undefeated champion of Death Match, but she can rarely hit the broad side of a barn at long range, even on Perfect Agent difficulty. Thus, the best strategy is to fire bursts from the balcony, and go full-auto or use the Superdragon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">noob tube</a> when she or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack">clones</a> try to flank. The mooks have even worse accuracy with automatics.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em>, this trope surprisingly does not affect the Colonial-era soldiers you fight in the historical missions, who are fairly good shots with their flintlock pistols and muskets. Ironically, it is most prevalent in the modern-era missions when Desmond faces Abstergo security guards.

</li></ul></li><li> Most police officers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superhero</a> series. Surely <em>some</em> police officer would think of just shooting Joker as soon as he shows up and giggles. (Especially given that he's a known cop-killer and mass murderer.) Granted, killing him would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">kill the series</a> but most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s enemies are not bullet-proof.

In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, Batman himself realizes that he's been very lucky in avoiding death, and wonders aloud if The Joker, Two-Face, or "some punk" will get lucky someday. In many episodes, thugs armed with Thompson machine guns will fire nonstop at a hero or innocent and still miss every shot.
</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> can be all over the map in terms of aim (though it's safe to assume they never actually kill an enemy, considering the show's intended age group), but one henchman in the episode <em>POV</em> makes Darth Vader himself proud. He catches Batman and Montoya off-guard and proceeds to shoot around them in a near-perfect outline. He then continues to fire above them for about three straight seconds while Batman pulls out his grapple gun and repels away <em>still without getting hit</em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/W27iiPg.png">It has to be seen to be believed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Guys like this make you wonder if Bruce Wayne pays off some of these henchmen to intentionally miss</a>.

However, later in the movie it's explained that Batman actually <em>does</em> get hit with a few bullets whenever faced with automatic fire, it's just that his armored suit protects him as long as he's at long range.

A scenario shows two otherwise intelligent black men become stupid and they unload Uzis and pistols at each other from point-blank range and miss every shot, only to get instantly shot and killed by white policemen after they apologized to each other and said the whole thing was ridiculous.
</li><li> In another episode, Uncle Ruckus is shot at over a hundred times by police officers because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootHimHeHasAWallet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootHimHeHasAWallet">they thought his wallet was a gun</a>. Unsurprisingly, he lives.

</li><li> The heroes with ranged weapons tend to have very bad aim as well, though this is more within "realistic aiming skills". Yumi generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangComeback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangComeback">hits after her fans return</a>, rather than after the throw.

<ul><li> The episode "And the Wiener Is..." pokes fun at this: in a shooting range, various extras are shooting targets specific to their character: a track referee shoots a starter pistol at a target on the ceiling, a blind man shoots at the side of a barn, and an Imperial Stormtrooper shoots at a cardboard cutout of Luke Skywalker &mdash; and misses with every shot.
</li><li> Another example happened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuyPresentsLaughItUpFuzzball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuyPresentsLaughItUpFuzzball">Family Guy Presents: Laugh It Up, Fuzzball</a>.</em> When the group are fleeing the Death Star, no one is ever hit, even when Han (Peter) and Chewie (Brian) spend about 25 seconds standing at the doorway trying to get a couch through the door.

As they're running for the train, they're chased by the guards, who are shooting at them. When the others express concern over this, Peter calms them down by saying that the bad guys <em>never</em> hit the good guys. Cue the guards firing every which way (including pointing the rifle backwards) but at the escapees.

(The dragon is the size of a mountain, as Eddie quickly mentioned; exactly how he could miss isn't clear, as it happened offscreen, but it was obviously a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTunnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTunnel">Plot Tunnel</a> to make the heroes' job harder.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most cartoon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> can't hit for crap either. Whenever Cobra and G.I. Joe faced off in battle, firearms proved completely worthless in shooting down anything smaller than a helicopter, and most ground engagements ended in a massive fistfight. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TwistedToyfareTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TwistedToyfareTheatre">Twisted Toyfare Theatre</a></em> mocks this when the two factions are facing off inside Mego Spidey's house. Spidey notices that both sides are aiming unusually high, and reaches out to pull Duke's rifle barrel down to an effective angle; Joes and Cobra alike are horrified when this results in a dead Cobra soldier.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I.

Later, Flint is able to fight back efficiently after stealing one of their weapons, proving that the rifles themselves aren't the problem.

<ul><li> A particularly bizarre example in episode 6: Duke and Scarlett are walking down a corridor when they trip an alarm. Some COBRA troops come out of a door at the end of the hallway, and our heroes walk backwards to take cover behind some pillars while bullets miss them by feet. The second they make it there, the pillars start taking hits from the COBRA forces. Strangely, neither Duke nor Scarlett are able to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> either, despite sniping several outside minutes before, and the troops being backlit and standing in the open. Scarlett actually notes that she and Duke are pinned down.
</li><li> The even more egregious instance of a Cobra Trooper missing Snake Eyes with every shot from a long burst of his SMG, starting at less than a dozen metres away and steadily decreasing as Snake Eyes runs <em>directly towards him</em>, not even managing to place a single shot on target when the other's gotten close enough to kill him with his sword.
</li><li> There's also the absurd firefight with the Baroness and Destro against Gung-Ho and Roadblock at the HAARP facility. Where either side is about five feet apart, not in cover, shooting each other with automatic weapons, and still don't hit each other.

</li><li> Another episode has a hitman storming the retirement castle with an assault rifle to kill Grampa and missing every shot before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBystander">a nurse drives him off with a shotgun</a>.
</li><li> In "Homie the Clown" Fat Tony tries to have Krusty (who is actually Homer) assassinated but both Legs and Louie are unable to pull it off (Louie burning through an entire magazine and destroying a car but unable to hit his target standing directly next to it).

</li><li> Happens often with automatic weapons on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. Particular examples include:
<ul><li> "Wing," where multiple Chinese thugs fire at the boys and miss completely from mere feet away, even when the boys <em>are in the open with no cover at all</em>. This doesn't stop the boys from killing the same thugs with blind fire from guns they found lying around.
</li><li> "Medicinal Fried Chicken," when a bunch of heavily-armed gangsters are taken down slowly and one by one, in a close-range gunfight with South Park's incompetent police force, who are wielding only pistols.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in "Little Crime Stoppers," where the boys' presence incites nearby gangs to <em>accidentally shoot each other to death</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope shows up a few times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsCloneWars">Star Wars: Clone Wars</a></em> miniseries. For example, at one point Padm&eacute; uses Threepio as a target to make an invisible battle droid reveal its position. The droid fails to land a single shot on this shiny target walking slowly in a straight line.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The battle droids are also prone to this, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">with so many of them firing at once</a> they tend to hit things anyway. The droids even lampshade it a few times:
<div class="indent"><strong>Droid 1:</strong> What a terrible shot! <br><strong>Droid 2:</strong> Ah well, it's my programming. <br><br><strong>Droid 1:</strong> This is too easy! <br><strong>Droid 2:</strong> I <em>still</em> can't hit anything!
</div></li><li> The series also includes a bit attempting to explain why the stormtroopers were so much worse than the badass clone troopers: Apparently Jango Fett's cloned DNA was getting "stretched thin" by the end of the war, resulting in soldiers with worse combat abilities and marksmanship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>:
<ul><li> The stormtroopers here were clearly some of the Academy's finest. This is actually invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS1E04BreakingRanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS1E04BreakingRanks">an episode</a> centered on the actual academy, where one of the cadets that Erza befriended chose to say behind and help cover Erza's escape by deliberately missing the escape vehicle.
</li><li> Averted by Sabine. Despite being trained in an Imperial academy, she's an excellent shot.
</li><li> Played beautifully straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsSparkOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsSparkOfRebellion">first episode</a>. During a firefight, the heroes and some Wookiees are pinned down by a squad of stormtroopers. It's very obvious that, despite both the troopers and the heroes being completely stationary, most of the troopers' shots are all over the place, not hitting a thing, let alone the crates the heroes are hiding behind. Then Kanan decides to reveal himself as a Jedi in order to draw fire and protect everyone. He does this by climbing on top of a crate and standing there for a full two seconds before slowly walking towards the stormtroopers, all while they are STILL FIRING. He does dodge a whopping two shots by slightly moving his head to the side, but otherwise most of the shots don't even come close to hitting him.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS4E13FamilyReunionAndFarewell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS4E13FamilyReunionAndFarewell">series</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS4E14FamilyReunionAndFarewellPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS4E14FamilyReunionAndFarewellPartII">finale</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Emperor's Royal Guards have Ezra immobilized in midair with their Force Pikes, yet the stormtroopers still miss every shot. This gives Ezra the opportunity to escape by using the Force to hurl a boulder at all of them.</span>
</li><li> Lampshaded by Kanan in regards to Captain Rex's substandard aim while disguised as a stormtrooper in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS2E07StealthStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS2E07StealthStrike">"Stealth Strike"</a>. When Rex takes the helmet off, he quickly goes back to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">usual standard</a> of marksmanship.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kanan:</strong> Wow, you really <em>do</em> shoot like a stormtrooper. Guess I don't have too much to worry about.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Rex</strong>: It's this helmet. I can't see!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011">ThunderCats (2011)</a></em>: The Lizards are pretty bad shots when it comes to dealing with Lion-O and the surviving ThunderCats. The Cats themselves almost equally so, the arrows fired against the Lizards hit a grand total of two targets on-screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersGenerationOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersGenerationOne">Transformers Generation One</a></em> was the worst about this, with shots rarely hitting and even when they did, it mostly just knocked the target down without <em>too</em> much injury. The moment when Starscream nails a killshot on Brawn through the shoulder in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em> followed by Prowl, Ratchet and Ironhide suffering the same fates is what sells the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> tone of the movie if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetEater">giant planet-devouring monster</a> in the opening didn't already.
</li><li> Later <em>Transformers</em> series handle this somewhat differently. While shots hit often enough, Transformers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">very hard to kill</a> as, not only are they heavily armored robots, but the only sure way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">put one down for good</a> is to crack their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Spark Chamber</a>.
</li><li> Often taken to ridiculous levels, though. In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a> starts shooting at Raf, steadily walking towards him. Not one piece of ammo touches Raf, even when the mook gets close. Yes, Raf is <em>much</em> smaller than what the mook is used to firing at, but still...
</li><li> The Vehicon armies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> could not hit a target that was standing still. Even if the target was running, hundreds of robotic soldiers should have had no trouble getting a few shots in just shooting at random.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em> has this in the most absurd way. Hundreds of Foot Soldiers piling out of the Technodrome versus 9 stationary targets in a clump... and not only does no one get hit, but the turtles actually charge in, closing the distance to mere inches, and still the heroes are no worse for wear! There was some laser-dodging, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a> was obviously at work, but come on! Though, these are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">'80s</a> Foot Soldiers we are talking about here. Despite being (in theory) killer robots programmed to fight with ninja effectiveness; the chances of them actually killing everything was low. They were even less dangerous than any of the Human Foot Ninja throughout the franchise history. Karai from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">the 2003 series</a> even comments on their poor combat effectiveness (calling them "almost cartoonish") whilst in the process of upgrading them with the 03' series tech. After that, they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">much more deadly</a> and almost succeed in killing the whole group of Turtles when they are led to attack the 03' Turtles lair. Yet they still can't shoot anything worth a damn, ironically.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em>: Lord Hater's Watchdogs have trouble even hitting a <em>stationary</em> target! Although it could be Hand-Waved by their lack of depth perception since they just have an eyeball for a head. Lord Dominator's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> have much better aim by the sheer virtue of just shooting at everything in sight, reflecting their creator's love of destruction and chaos.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>, when Duncan and co. attack Spyke and the other Morlocks only a few of their shots came close to hitting their targets (and those were blocked), even when the target was standing still. The members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievesGuild">The Rippers</a> in "Cajun Spice" weren't much better.

<ul><li> On September 23, 1989, in Tacoma, Washington, US Army Ranger Staff Sergeant Bill Foulk was having a cookout with several of his Army Ranger friends and their families. Unexpectedly, drug dealers attacked the party in retaliation for Foulk organizing a neighborhood watch and other protection programs, which included videotaping a nearby crack house. Although more than 300 rounds were reportedly fired from semiautomatic firearms, not a single injury resulted on either side. Nobody from Foulk's party was prosecuted &mdash; due to the incident in question being an open-shut case of self-defense &mdash; but their commanding officer ordered them to spend several months of extended time on the firing range for not hitting their targets.
</li><li> John Foley, a British tank commander in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WW2</a>, related in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MailedFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MailedFist">Mailed Fist</a></em> how he was graded "marksman" with the Webley pistol, and that his men frequently cleaned up on bets on his winning shooting contests on the ranges. But in the aftermath of his tank being destroyed in Normandy, he was leading the remnant of his crew back to British lines when he encountered a group of German soldiers trying to emplace a machine-gun. In the heat of battle, he shot at the Germans from barely six feet away - and missed by miles. The Germans did abandon the machine gun and run for it, which, given the circumstances (angry Englishmen in their faces), was a rational course of action.
</li><li> In the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout">Miami-Dade<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout">North Hollywood<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> shootouts <em>thousands</em> of shots were fired by both the perps and officers/agents,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2g3ll');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2g3ll" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2g3ll');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In both cases, both sides were trained shooters, Plant and Matix being the ex-soldiers, and Phillips/M&#259;t&#259;s&#259;reanu a seasoned weekend warrior.</span> with only about dozens connecting in both cases, neatly fitting in the common ~1% hit rate of modern gun battles. The North Hollywood shootout also averted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>, as both robbers wore body armor and shrugged off several otherwise incapacitating hits.
</li><li> Happens quite a lot with poorer countries and, even more commonly, non-state militants. Setting up firing ranges, giving soldiers practice rounds, and dealing with the added cost of gun maintenance all cost money that isn't readily available. Insurgents not only have to deal with these issues, but also with the fact practice firing is noisy and even rudimentary training bases make tempting targets for enemy strike aircraft. Many of these fighters are only given a quick lesson about how their guns work and how to properly aim without firing rounds, which, combined with often poorly maintained and improperly sighted guns, leads to wildly inaccurate fire.
</li><li> Range is an issue. Characters in movies generally shoot at each other from close range, so you can see everyone's face and things feel appropriately dramatic. In real war, it's much more common to shoot at far-away enemies whom you can barely see, which of course reduces your accuracy.
</li><li> Suppressive fire deserves a mention. This is when, for instance, your enemy is behind a wall or something, and you know that if he gets around the wall then he'll start shooting at you (or whatever else he's got planned), so you deliberately fire into the empty air right around the edges of the wall. As long as you keep firing, the enemy can't get around the wall without taking a big risk. This allows you time to call for backup or whatever. This more common in real life than in movies, because it's always more dramatic if someone is actually trying to shoot someone else, instead of deliberately shooting at empty space for strategic purposes.
<ul><li> Suppressive fire forms part of the "fire and manuver" tactics that have been developed in some form by everyone since WWII. The idea is you do suppressive fire to hold the enemy down with one group (a "base of fire") while the others go around to engage the enemy. Then when the enemy is no longer a threat, the base of fire moves to a new location. Rinse and repeat until the engagement is done.
</li><li> This probably led to the statistic floating around on the internet that for every casualty in combat, thousands of rounds have been expended.
</li></ul></li><li> The M247 Sergeant York self-propelled anti-aircraft gun is infamous for its habit of only being able to hit things it wasn't supposed to be targeting. Even when presented with a target floating stationary at point-blank range, it <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">managed to miss.</a> This is likely because of issues with the electronic hardware (including the targeting computer and its radar interface) not being moisture-resistant as opposed to the guns being inaccurate.
</li><li> The Villar Perosa M15 was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">WW1</a> Italian submachine gun. It had two barrels meant for use as an aircraft gun (or, more likely, for a light flak gun). An infantry version was created with a largely useless bipod and few other changes to make it usable by soldiers on the ground. Each barrel fired independently of the other, and the only sight was a small hole. When shot, particularly when both barrels were fired at the same time, the gun would bounce all over the place, rendering the sight useless and making it virtually impossible to aim. This would be rectified by a dedicated tripod, but this rendered the gun immobile.
</li><li> The Lee-Metford Mk I rifle, when updated to Mk I* standard to accomodate the new cordite-powered cartridges in service with the British Army, was found to miss targets a lot owing to the practices of the era. The iron sights were forged and marked to match hypothetical bullet trajectories without any live-fire testing being done at all.
