</div></div><p><strong>This is a gameplay trope, not a narrative trope. Unless the character a) has specs mentioned in some way, and b) is explicitly stated to not be a boss, then no story examples are valid. This trope is also therefore not possible in real life.</strong>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> in video games typically aren't supposed to be too hard on their own. They are usually just there to soften up the heroes before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> of a level (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLevelsEasyBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLevelsEasyBosses">usually</a>). But there are exceptions, enemies that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">annoying</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">dangerous, and/or powerful</a>. This trope is the top tier of these, enemies that are so powerful, you wouldn't be blamed for mistaking them for bosses (hence the trope name).
</p><p>For example, let's say you are playing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternRPG">Eastern RPG</a>. You're walking along on your quest to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavingTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavingTheWorld">save the world</a>, when you run into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounter</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">three-headed, skeletal dragon</a>. You're 12 levels higher than the average enemy here, so just give it a few attacks, and it should be over with.
</p><p>But not only is it still standing after three turns, but most of your party has lost over half their health. So you don't hold back. You launch your best spells and special attacks at it, using your healer's super expensive full party heal spell. <em>Eventually</em>, it goes down, but not before you had to resurrect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">the mage</a> twice, and you had to use up two-thirds of your total magic point pool.

</li><li> It does <em>a lot</em> more damage than a regular enemy (moot if the protagonist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>) and is quite capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kills</a>. Can also have attacks that are difficult to avoid (whether or not dodging is based on skill or chance).

(The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a> is almost certainly useless here, unless used as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideTheBoxTactic">Outside-the-Box Tactic</a>.)

Luckily, you can sneak past them most of the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kunekune</span>, which is encountered via a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> in the game. Said enemy is very formidable: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merely <em>looking at it</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">so horrifying</a> that it inflicts Curse on you (which cuts HP and MP in half) and deals constant damage, stunlocking you to death extremely quickly without it even having to touch you</span>. To make matters worse, you will have to fight this enemy over and over again if you plan on getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.
</li><li> The Guardian (also known as the Final Guard in later games) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>. They protect the room to Dracula (poorly, since there is the way below), but they are still really tough to beat (barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> methods).
<ul><li> And the Cthulhu when you first encounter it in the Marble Gallery. They only guard a way back to the entrance but they are very difficult at this point in the game. They are easy when you encounter them in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Inverted Castle</span> though, since this is much later in the game.
</li><li> Victory Armor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a></em>. It's a pushover when you meet it just before Death, but until then, watch out.
</li><li> The Devil from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCircleOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaCircleOfTheMoon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a></em>. So much so that the final room of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">The Arena</a> (a series of fights with large groups of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> with no magic) is populated only by a single Devil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a></em> has a few. There is an armour type knight very similar to the later Guardian that can do heavy damage. In one level, there are <em>two</em> at once, in a tiny room with little breathing room. Better hope you have enough hearts to item crash! And in Stage 5, there is a painting that moves. If you get hit by it, it somehow catches you and then snaps in half, instantly killing your character. Just keep attacking it from a distance as it flies around the room or you're fucked.
</li></ul></li><li> The Koshas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> are immune to almost all attacks, wield gigantic spiked clubs that can deal twice the normal damage with just one hit, and in Crystal Caves, a giant one causes level-wide tremors that make debris and stalactites fall all over the place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, Cannons. Since they show up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">at least once per level</a>, typically require the same combat strategy as bosses, and use increasingly difficult rooms to fight in, one could see them as unofficial mini-bosses.
</li><li> The Dust Men mecha conduits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFamous">inFAMOUS</a></em> are two stories tall, have attacks involving chucking fiery projectiles the size of cars and an equally fiery Gatling gun, and are armored HP on legs that take a good five-to-ten minutes to kill. The first time you see one, you fight it alone on an empty field...but after that, they populate the game world, and are often surrounded by boatloads of other enemies and distractions. One particularly harrowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> mission involves fighting off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">two at once</a></em> while two dozen other Dust Men pepper you with gunfire around them.

Iron Knuckles require twitch reflexes both to survive their attacks and get past their shields, but the hardest are the Eagle Knights in the Great Palace: they are similar to the Iron Knuckles, but both red and blue ones can cast sword beams at you, and they can leap over you. At full attack level, the Red versions take two to three hits to kill and the blue ones five to six. They usually appear in a place where it is very difficult to run away from them.
</li><li> Darknuts and Iron Knuckles are this when they aren't used as bosses or mini-bosses themselves. Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em> feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee">Multi-Mook Melees</a> that end in fights against three Darknuts, and they're more difficult than the final bosses. However, in <em>Twilight Princess</em>, if you have the Magic Armor that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">eats money</a>, or <em>Wind Waker</em>'s Magic Armor that eats magic and a few blue or green potions, you're pretty well set.

</li><li> Lynels are recurring enemies harkening back to the first game, and are among the most difficult of the common enemies wherever they appear, to the point that <em>one</em> will kill you outright early in the game, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em> is where they start earning this status. These lion-centaurs roam eastern Death Mountain, and it's a far better idea to run away from them than to try and fight them. They have an absurd amount of HP, taking <em>eight</em> hits from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">golden Master Sword</a></em> to kill. They're practically immune to being stunned and aren't stunned on hit. They also deal immense damage with their flame breath that has a very far reach, and they'll continue using the fire breath even when you're out of reach so you can't immediately run back in. Stay away. <em>Far away.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTriForceHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTriForceHeroes">The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> ReDeads not only have high health, but can also emit a scream with a large radius to stun you, then latch onto you and leech your health away. You won't be able to do anything until your teammates intervene (that is, if they aren't stunned as well). It doesn't help that at one point you have to face <em>four</em> of these nightmares at once. (This goes for every game they're in, minus the part where <em>you get teammates.</em> Have fun!)
</li><li> There's also the Aeralfos in the final two levels. In addition to flying too high for you to hit even with a max-height totem, they very rarely come down, and when they do, they pull off a hard to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeStrikeCombo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeStrikeCombo">Three-Strike Combo</a>. You then only have a narrow window to strike them from behind before they take to the air again. Worst of all, they come in packs, and will attack in tandem, making it even harder to avoid being hit.

<ul><li> Lynels return in the game, making their first appearance in a 3D <em>Zelda</em> game, and take several more levels in badass. They are extremely fast, powerful, and durable. Attack them blindly, and they'll parry your attacks with their shields (if they wield one-handed swords) or just outright attack you in the middle of your onslaught (if they wield two-handed weapons). Distance yourself from them, and watch them whip out their bows to snipe at you with frightening accuracy. Try to get cover somewhere, and they'll shoot their arrows <em>up</em> and rain them on you. Try to run away from them on horseback, and <em>they catch up to you</em>, no matter what your horse has for stats. Try to run away from them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHorseIsAMotorbike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyHorseIsAMotorbike">on the Master Cycle Zero</a> from the Champions' Ballad DLC, and <em>they keep up with you</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">They get even more dangerous when they start losing health, gaining more powerful attacks</a>.

The first time you'll likely encounter one is at Zora's Domain, where you're tasked with collecting some Shock Arrows that it left lying around in order to take down Vah Ruta. The Zoras themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">are afraid of it</a> and advise you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">to stay out of its sight while you steal its arrows</a> rather than fight it head-on. In a curious case of this trope, the Mook Clothing actually has gameplay ramifications.
</li><li> All monsters in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> have a tierarchy (most of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfChromaticSuperiority">represented by colour</a>), except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">Molduga</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseCult">Yiga Clan</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Guardians</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. If you take out enough normal monsters, then when they are respawned by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoonRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadMoonRising">blood moon</a>, their replacements will be of a higher tier. Field bosses have fixed tiers for their spawn locations, and never get beefed up. Because Lynels are considered normal enemies by the game, they are improved based on their defeats. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Most normal monsters also have silver varieties that start to spawn after you taken out enough of the monster in question, whereas field bosses do not; furthermore, the <em>Master Trials</em> DLC introduces <em>gold</em> varieties, as every common monster is beefed up a tier. Lynels have Silver and Gold varieties.</span>
</li><li> Ancient Arrows play by strange rules based on the target they hit; they add to the weapon strength of the bow that fires them for bosses, take off one third of the HP of Guardians (with damage tripled into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">Go for the Eye</a>), and eliminate normal enemies immediately without giving any drops.

Goes double for Twilight Princess map battles in Adventure Mode, where they'll be inflicting more damage than most commanders, too. And God forbid you meet any enemies with red auras. They're not only powerful, but almost completely immune to flinching when attacked.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook">Hammer</a> with boxing gloves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a></em> is fought in the Fitness Center. It can block Strobulb flashes (your only way to make ghosts vulnerable to your Poltergust) with it's gloves and unlike other Hammers, it pursues you throughout the room, giving you only a split second to dodge its punching attacks. To defeat it, you have to bait another Hammer into throwing a weight at it, thus making it dizzy and vulnerable to the Strobulb, but there's not much to indicate that.
</li><li> Blue Dragon, the Aquamantis homage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDDotGameHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDDotGameHeroes">3D Dot Game Heroes</a></em>. It does ridiculous amounts of damage and can take a few hits to boot. The good news is it rarely shows up, the bad news is it can show virtually anywhere.

Here's something interesting, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Bar-Bot will <em>kick your ass</em></span>. You remember the Cybrid Joes? These are ten times worse. They move faster, hit harder and have a lot more health. To top it off, they have THEIR OWN RAMPAGE MODE. Many a player has fallen short of the finish line fighting these guys. But it gets better! In Mad Survival, a harder DLC edition of survival, the fifth wave pits you up against two Maxes and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <strong>three Bar-Bots at once</strong></span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Have fun!</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em> has the enemy duo known as Gracious and Glorious. While they don't have a huge amount of health or hit extremely hard, they make up for it in sheer speed: the two of them can easily hit and combo you, and it's difficult to keep pummelling them even after you've gotten some solid hits in because they can break out of your combos so easily. To make matters worse, it's <em>impossible</em> to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Witch Time</a> against them through normal methods. Oh, and expect to face off with Gracious and Glorious more frequently on Hard difficulty and above.
</li><li> The Hellknights from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deception">Deception 3</a></em> are this trope. These guys are almost indestructible &mdash; taking only 1 point of damage from anything that doesn't ignore protection, they're immune to the effects of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson">summon ring</a>, they have a long distance rush attack where they practically fly at you and a single swipe from their scythe will rip out large chunks of your health. A last kicker is they can also teleport. Most bosses in the game aren't even close to matching the deadliness of a Hellknight. Good thing there's only a handful of them. The most dangerous individual in the game (after yourself) is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Hellknight that's been given even better stats and some extra powers, who only shows up in the final challenge stage.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em> also has the Blitz enemies. Spends most of it's time encased in a lightning shield which hurts Dante/Nero should they melee attack them whilst it's up, leaving you to spam the weak ranged moves to get rid of the shield. They also love to teleport around the arena in a ball of lightning, are invincible whilst doing so, and will appear and strike without warning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">sometimes right in front of you</a>. Thankfully in story you only have to deal with one at a time, but in the Bloody Palace survival mode, you have to deal with 2 at once. The only thing that makes these guys even slightly easier is that because they're blind they sometimes attack anything that fights in the room. Then if you take them down to a certain level of health, but don't do enough damage to finish them them during their shield down phase, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a> and in addition to normal attacking at even greater speeds, will find great joy in trying to spear you with their horns, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">blow up with you</a> impaled on them (thankfully, like all DMC grabs, this can be broken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">entering DT mode</a>).

Initially, you fight him on level two as a proper boss fight. Some stages later, Hell Vanguards appear regularly in the middle of levels as if they're regular foes. In some instances, you fight two of them at once, and Hell Vanguards are not the kind of enemy you want to fight two-on-one.

These ninjas can and will block everything you shoot at them, sometimes even <em>reflecting</em> them, are damn fast, and when comboed can suddenly break out of your combo and counter you with nigh-undodgeable attacks. Fighting them in harder difficulty modes where you'll see them together with other enemies, sometimes OTHER Dreamrunners, and especially in <em>Hell and Hell</em> where you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, is a <strong>nightmare</strong>.
</li><li> The Witch. Annoying enough in lower difficulty thanks to their shield which can only broken with Angel weapons, and that they can teleport as well as shoot homing attacks, and worst of all, they can transfer their shield to another enemy, but in hard mode where they'll get paired with the WORST enemies (including said Dreamrunners), you'll be pulling your hair out. Their only slight saving grace is that they are relatively rare.

</li><li> Duke Devlin, who doesn't even consider himself a duelist, is one of the toughest opponents early on and can even give you trouble in the endgame. His lategame strategy revolves around using Soul of the Pure, Hourglass of Life, and Darkness Approaches to repeatedly power up his monsters and heal the LP cost for its effects. He also carries cards like Raigeki, which wipes out your field.
</li></ul></li><li> In other <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> video game adaptations, you may occasionally run into an extra who happens to be running an uncannily competent deck which can easily trounce you despite it being an early part of the game where your supply to cards and ability to create good decks is lacking. An example includes <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Angie">Angie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em>Stardust Accelerator</em>, running a slightly watered-down (but still fearsome) version of a Deck that topped tournaments at the time of the game's release. Another example is Minegishi from <em>Over the Nexus</em>, who uses a strong Anti-Meta Chaos Deck. And he appears at the <strong>very beginning</strong> of the game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> also has this but in a different way &mdash; there is only really one enemy that's treated as a miniboss, and that's the Siren. Firemen, Zealots, Motorized Patriots, and Handymen all get their introductory fight but then appear right along with other mooks. Zealots (also known as Crows) like to try and sneak attack you, and their bird forms are easy to glance over. Beasts deal in explosive weapons and have metal armor that makes them much harder to kill than standard mooks, but don't even count as heavy hitters like the rest of the mentioned foes, so at least you can use Possession to quickly kill them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has the Badass Pyro Threshers. Threshers are already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">pains in the ass to kill</a>, and badasses are immensely more powerful than the bog standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a>. Combining one and the other makes an almost ludicrously powerful flaming sandworm that has a truly ridiculous amount of HP and can down a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">just by erupting out of the ground.</a>
</li><li> Varkids can evolve by putting themselves in pods in the middle of a battle. Let an Ultimate Badass Varkid do that and what do you get ? Vermivorous The Invincible, who could be called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Crawmerax III</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Terramorphous II</a>" seeing how much of a pain he is.
</li><li> The Goliath enemies. Shooting their helmet off sends them into a rage where they will attack enemy and ally alike. This can be useful to rid an area of enemies, but with each enemy they take out, they restore their health and ascend to a new level of anger until they become GOD-liaths. The level increase can be so huge that it displays a skull next to their level, indicating the player's level is too low to even put a dent in them.
</li><li> Rabid Skags and Stalkers. They do not register as Badasses but more often than not they are much more of a danger due to their speed and power. You are practically <em>guaranteed</em> to do down in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Fight For Your Life mode</a> at least once when facing even one of them. Technically every enemy type has one (Angelic Guards, Juggernauts, Bullyrots, to name a few) but they are either clearly badasses (Juggs) or are only mildly more dangerous than their counterparts. A single Rabid can harass an entire team of four if left unchecked, and they rarely spawn alone...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em> had Fusion Hulks, gigantic versions of the Hulk armed with the most powerful primary weapon in the game, the Fusion Cannon. They have a ton of health (being one of only three things in the game that can tank a direct hit by a Mega Missile, and the other two are explicit bosses), and a single shot from the cannons can bring you down to half health, regardless of difficulty. Fortunately, they are almost always alone or in pairs at the worst, but there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">Mook Maker</a> in one of the final levels that generates one of them every six seconds. <em>Descent 2</em> introduced a similar idea, with the robot affectionately dubbed the Red Fatty Jr. Another miniboss &mdash; while the projectiles it fires aren't half as damaging as the Fusion Hulk's, it has even more HP &mdash; the most out of any non-boss enemy in <em>Descent 1</em> and <em>2</em>.
<ul><li> <em>Descent 1</em> also has the Red Hulks. While they don't have quite as many hitpoints as the Fusion Hulks and their homing missiles don't do as much damage as the latter's fusion cannons, they fire them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">salvos</a> on higher difficulty levels. And, obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">they home in on you</a>. They're also smaller targets than the fusion hulks, and appear much earlier in the game when you don't have as many powerful weapons.
</li><li> Another example from <em>Descent 2</em> is the Boarshead, which fires volleys of Smart Missiles, which can often kill you in seconds even with maximum shields.
</li><li> In the <em>Descent 2</em> Vertigo Expansion Pack, the MAX droid fires homing flash missiles &mdash; considered by most players to be the most annoying type of weapon in the game, which were originally only wielded by the level 16 boss in the main <em>Descent 2</em> campaign. There's also the SPIKE, which comes equipped with a nasty Omega Cannon.
</li><li> During the later levels of <em>Descent 3</em>, there are some tank-like enemies in outdoor areas which fire Mega Missiles (notable for being the only non-boss enemies in the entire franchise to wield these weapons).
</li></ul></li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Arch-Viles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII">Doom II</a></em>. They have a very powerful flame attack that does heavy damage if you're in their line of sight when it finishes, and they can resurrect dead monsters as often as they like, with the exception of Cyberdemons, Spider Masterminds, and of course other Arch-Viles. They are the fastest moving enemies in the game as well, meaning they can quickly get themselves in position to attack you. They also have the lowest pain chance of any enemy, meaning if there's nowhere to hide, it's very hard to interrupt its attack by making it flinch. Oh, and their toughness is approaching 3/4 that of a Baron of Hell, two of which showed up as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> of Doom's first episode before showing up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">Degraded Boss</a> in various levels in Doom and Doom II thereafter. Thankfully though they do have a maximum range, and are unable to attack if you're over a certain distance away. Unless you hit them first, in which case they <em>will</em> retaliate against your aggression. The only other saving grace is that if another monster accidentally hits them, the Arch-vile will immediately target that other monster and attack it instead, possibly buying you some time.
</li><li> The stand-alone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">source port mod</a> Scoredoom has quite a big variety of these type of enemies, with many of the superboss enemies (each one having 6000 hitpoints, with the Superdemon having only 4000) being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">much worse than the UDoom Endbosses.</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom">Brutal Doom</a></em> and mod-of-the-mod <em>Project Brutality</em> brings many otherwise medium-level enemies to miniboss status, and you encounter them all the friggin' time. The Barons of Hell and Hell Knights, in particular, get a lot more health, double damage and an alternate attack that lets them deal triple the firepower.
</li><li> Hell Knights in <em>Doom 3</em> are that particular game's answer to the Barons of Hell. And just like the original, you fight a pair of them before warping into hell. This time, you probably have the BFG, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">although you lose it shortly after.</a>
</li><li> Bruisers in <em>Resurrection of Evil</em> - take a Hell Knight, cross him with a Mancubus, and then stand the hell back.

No longer they are lumbering, slow-moving behemoths, these guys can now rapidly close the distance between you with crushing stomps, are much tougher to kill, and can easily kill an unprepared player.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal">Doom Eternal</a></em> introduces the Marauder, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> who can and will kick your ass to Hell and back unless you are absolutely prepared to deal with him. He moves around like a murderous jumping bean, can block all of the Slayer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetAMookToKillAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetAMookToKillAMook">and other demons'</a> attacks most of the time, and can slice and dice you with his battleaxe -&#150; usually by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">throwing axe beams</a>, sometimes running up and using the axe itself, of which the latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">the only time he drops his guard</a> -&#150; or blast you to pieces with his own <em>Super Shotgun</em> if you're close enough. And once they start showing up as regular enemies, this trope comes to play.
</li></ul></li><li> The titular Blood Dragons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a></em>. They have <em>lots</em> of health, deal <em>a lot</em> of damage with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>, require a lot of strategy thanks to having a small weakpoint on its torso (and considering that they're bent down when they're not firing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>), it IS hard to hit that. They can spawn randomly around the map, and are the only enemies that have a marker and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> appear whenever they are in the vicinity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hunters, who have consistently grown tougher, stronger, faster, and smarter in each new game:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, the Hunters were actually ridiculously easy compared to other foes once you know how to deal with them, which is especially evident on the hardest difficulty, where even the lowliest Elite is a dangerous threat. Simply get close to the Hunter, wait for it to try to melee, dodge and circle around to its back and put a single pistol or shotgun round into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">the exposed flesh</a>, which brings them down in a single stroke. However, they fixed this from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> onward; Hunters now have an attack designed specifically to crush players standing directly behind them, and even if you have a power weapon, it will usually take multiple shots into their unarmored areas to kill them (as opposed to just one shot from any precision weapon like in <em>CE</em>).
</li><li> By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> Hunters had reached some sort of Boss in Mook Clothing nirvana. They take ridiculous amounts of ammunition to kill, are near impossible to get behind no matter how much you run, jump or even jetpack over them, can potentially kill you in one hit even on Normal, and are just a lot faster, tougher, and quicker than they ever were before. The best bet is literally to sit as far away as possible and rocket spam them, which isn't always an option. Even going up behind them and shooting their exposed backs with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">shotgun</a> takes 3-4 hits on Heroic, and more on Legendary. And since they'll turn around and take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeMeleeRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeMeleeRevenge">Extreme M&ecirc;l&eacute;e Revenge</a> on you as soon as you fire once, and your shotgun is a close-range pump-action weapon... Even plasma grenades are significantly reduced in effectiveness, because the Hunters can catch them on the shield.
</li><li> And if that wasn't enough, Hunters become <em>even</em> more powerful in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>, to the point where it's nearly impossible to beat them one-on-one unless you have <em>a lot</em> of explosives handy. Otherwise, you're probably going to need your entire fireteam to take them down.
</li></ul></li><li> Other examples introduced in the original trilogy include the gold Elite Zealots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> (which will slice and dice anything that gets too close) and the silver-white Ultra Elites in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> (especially in the Arbiter Mausoleum, aka the "Breaking Benjamin Room" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee">Multi-Mook Melee</a>), and the Brute Chieftains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> (who have one-hit-kill hammers and shields that make them temporarily invincible to all damage). All three have stayed this way through the entirety of the franchise (even if the Zealots are now dark-purple).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>'s third mission, another pseudo-boss encounter involves a pair of indigenous giant reptilian/monkey-like creatures called Gutas who you find in the middle of stomping on various Grunts, which are not seen anywhere else in the game, and are surprisingly dangerous if you actually do grab their attention. <em>Reach</em> also introduces the gold Elite Generals and marks the return of the Elite Zealots (now improved and purple).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>, the Promethean Knights have been upgraded to being the Promethean version of Hunters.

</li><li> Demons. Really fast, really strong, soak up bullets like a sponge does water. One could be in any room. You'll learn to be very afraid when you see one. And then there are the times when you fight MORE THAN ONE AT ONCE.

Their homing exploding spiked ball attack is nigh-impossible to dodge, and would chase you at high speed through winding corridors.

Their loot doesn't compensate for the trouble at all, and with a few exceptions they aren't relevant to any quest either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleStations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleStations">Battle Stations</a></em> features a few of these.

These creatures are almost impossible to beat by players in the level ranges for which they appear.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline">Dynasty Warriors Online</a></em>, there are a few ways this comes into play, all of them more YMMV ways to think of them as mooks.
<ul><li> Players, when they set up correctly, and completely take you by surprise when you go in to attack, such as being able to murder your tanking setup in one hit, or having rendered themselves immune to flinching beforehand, meaning that when you attacked they could just turn and bring out the pain, or by using an item that allows them to change their move-set, but not their stats, allowing them to attack you in a way you didn't see coming.
</li><li> If you have yet to face a general, the characters from the original games rather than a created character, you may be surprised on how much damage they can take, dish out, and the fact that they don't flinch to almost (or sometimes) all of your attacks. Aside from their battle aura, you may fully mistake them for another player, meaning that they seem so very mookish. It doesn't help that using specific items, players can temporarily turn into them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em>:
<ul><li> Monsters way more powerful than their level (shown prosaically through the /consider command) indicated, many a newbie and soloer have died to undercons over the years. In the game's early days almost every mob was an undercon after level 20, meaning that unless a player was a dedicated solo class, they had to group to progress.
</li><li> Holly Windstalker was a particularly notorious example. Not only did she undercon, but she appeared to be a friendly, fairly weak NPC innocently wandering a low-level zone. She would also immediately aggro if the character was an "evil" class or caught harassing the local wildlife (which the zone was full of, most of them aggressive on their own), making her this trope, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> all combined.

<ul><li> The Stone Summit mobs in the elite dungeon Slaver's Exile. Unlike the haphazard build of many enemies, these have strong and coordinated builds with multiple resurrection skills. On top of that, they possess all the usual monster perks like having effectively infinite energy and being almost half again your level, reducing the damage they take and increasing the damage you take. Expanded with the <em>Guild Wars: Beyond</em> updates. New questlines introduce new mooks throughout Cantha and Kryta who have the same perks as the Exiled Stone Summit.
</li><li> ArenaNet's definition of "boss" means that many of the final bosses in campaigns and dungeons are easily mistaken for regular mooks. They are deemed "boss-like foes", which means while they enjoy all the perks of being a boss (double damage and unique abilities), the player cannot copy their skills and they lack the signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">boss aura</a>.

It also has triple the stats of any other encounter in the area. It's still a pushover if you're backtracking, but encountering it when you first unlock the area means you're likely to get beaten up by it. Adventurers in the undersea zone Octopus's Garden should be wary of the moister oyster, a super-tough monster with substantial resistance to all types of damage encountered there on a semi-rare basis.
</li><li> Plenty of variations on this theme appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em>. There are areas of the open world map designed to be tackled by groups rather than single players; a solo player who stumbles into them will find ordinary on-level mooks are extremely difficult to kill. (This is usually achieved by giving them much, much more HP than ordinary mobs as well as nastier attacks.) The game also generates rare, uniquely-named wandering mobs that are much tougher than ordinary landscape creatures. Most of these don't look any different than ordinary mooks, though, so they can be a nasty surprise to the inattentive player.
</li><li> All over the place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTheTerrible">Fluffy the Terrible</a>, as most enemies look either harmless, cute, or similar to another enemy.

<ul><li> The game has a skill called Dungeoneering in which the player travels through a cave called Daemonheim fighting monsters. Sometimes, it seems, that monsters and their levels are random, which means you'll find an ordinary looking mook who is severely overpowered. For example, a level 95 Giant Rat (who are usually level 2).
</li><li> Tormented Demons spawn with a flame shield that has to be removed with a specific demon-slaying sword, swap around protection prayers to block your attack style, and can hit incredibly hard.
</li><li> The Glacors fit the bill perfectly. They have loads of health, can only be feasibly killed with fire magic, summon flunkies around half health, and take on a passive buff from the final flunky you kill.
</li><li> The Rune Dragons. Whereas both the Glacors and the Tormented Demons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">originally appear as quest bosses</a>, the Rune Dragons are not alluded to anywhere in-game outside of the area where they can be fought<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1w96h');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1w96h" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1w96h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unless the player receives a slayer task for them, but even that doesn't explain how to open said area.</span> Despite not being a boss of any sort themselves, they have a three-phase fight, which features a first phase in which they are nearly impervious to all attacks except for one specific difficult-to-obtain type of crossbow bolt, a second phase in which they are completely invulnerable to melee damage and gain a heavy-hitting area-of-effect attack which is only partially blocked by dragonfire-protecting items, and a third phase in which the damage they deal <strong>increases exponentially the longer you take to beat them</strong>, resulting in attacks that can take out even high-level players in a single blow if you dawdle too much. And their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite forms</a> have a small chance of spawning every time you kill a lesser one, which have significantly higher life bars and deal even higher damage.
</li><li> Lava Strykewyrms are much tougher than the other kinds of strykewyrm. They have much higher stats than regular Strykewyrms, they can use all three combat styles, and they have an improved version of the strykewyrm digging attack that is harder to dodge because it instantly drags you on top of them instead of them moving towards you. Fighting Lava Strykewyrms is also much more dangerous because they are only found in the wilderness where other players can attack you and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful">continuing is more painful than normal</a>. Plus, when killing Lava Strykewyms, there's a chance that a boss version called the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildyWyrm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildyWyrm">Wildy Wyrm</a> will appear, although it doesn't become aggressive until a player deliberately provokes it.
</li><li> Many of the monsters listed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DemonicSpiders/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DemonicSpiders/RuneScape">Demonic Spiders / RuneScape</a> are also this.

Both of them carry shields which make them impervious to frontal attacks(apart from bombs). The former is almost impossible to shield push(which, starting from Tier 2, becomes vital to your survival), hits like a truck and can inflict Shock on you with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> attack. The latter looks almost puny by comparison... until you realize it can revive fallen Zombies/Bombies. Both of them appear very infrequently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has three separate classifications of enemies tougher than standard-issue mooks: Strong, Elite, and Champion. Strong enemies are usually found alone, as opposed to packs of three for basic foes, and put up a significant fight. It's not uncommon for one to take out a player who made a particular blunder or aggroed one enemy too many. Elites are almost always isolated fights in open zones (in instanced Heroic and Flashpoint zones, which are meant for groups, Elites are the basic enemy), and are in many cases more difficult than actual bosses; indeed, most bosses are elite-grade. Champions exist for two reasons &mdash; as a challenge for groups, or to obliterate players who wander into the opposite faction's territory.
</li><li> There's also the fun variation where you attack a Strong or Elite standing on their own... only to discover his Strong/Elite friend(s), who had been either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">standing out of sight</a> or only appeared when you attacked.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline">Ultima Online</a></em> had a fair amount of these. Their were a limited number of sprites for monsters and many monsters used the same sprite with a palette swap. For instance, one player could handily dispatch an air elemental. A team of experienced players could take down a blood elemental. An acid elemental was a sort of walking nuke and would occasionally kite a player into the wilderness where it would slaughter unsuspecting travelers and haunt the dreams of children until the server reset. And there were at least four different creatures that used the demon sprite, ranging from minor demons that weren't especially horrid, to the Balron (not to be mistaken for the similar yet totally distinct Balrog), which had one of the highest hit point totals in the game and could outrun a mounted player in a straight run. Which didn't stop someone from soloing them for fun. While riding a Llama.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline">Warhammer Online</a></em> loves this trope. Fighting a bunch of nameless mooks? Well odds are there will be one in that pack wandering around somewhere who is a champion which means many more HP and hits a lot harder. They also tend to be physically identical to the nameless mooks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wildstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wildstar">Wildstar</a></em> features 'Prime' rank foes, which are much more powerful than comparable foes in a given area. Not only do they typically have much larger and more powerful telegraph attacks than a normal enemy, they also possess layers of "Interrupt Armor" that makes it almost impossible for a solo player (or an uncoordinated team) to disrupt their attacks and expose their weaknesses. Prime foes look identical to their more common brethren, save for a red glow. You encounter them as early as the second zone you visit, and if you fail to recognize that "red glow = bad", they <em>will</em> kill you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has its own classification for such monsters: elite. While those monsters mostly show up in dungeons geared for a group of player capable to deal with them, but some of them are found in the open world and can quickly kill unsuspecting players. To make matters worse, elite mobs are really inconsistent in regards to how strong they actually are. They would range anywhere from "harder than the average mob, but most classes can kill it solo", through "<strong>way</strong> harder than the average mob, but a few classes/specs may be able to kill it solo with much difficulty", and all the way to "abandon all hope, ye who fight this thing without a group". Without prior knowledge, you'd have no idea which category any given "elite" belonged to until you started fighting it.
<ul><li> WANTED: HOGGER &mdash; Woe to any newbies who think he is just your average level 11 gnoll!
<ul><li> This low-level mob's fearsome reputation has been immortalized in an expansion. Not only is he a memory alongside raid and dungeon bosses you may fight during one encounter, he now has his very own statistic tracked by the game: Deaths by Hogger.
</li><li> Hogger got so famous that he lost this trope. In Cataclysm, he was moved and is the new endboss of the Stormwind Stockade dungeon. This effectively turns Hogger into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook">King Mook</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Devilsaurs, <em>T. rex</em>-like enemies that patrol an entire zone. Unlike other giant enemies, their movement isn't easy to hear, earning them a reputation of being <em>sneaky</em>. Devilsaurs also have a rare elite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook">King Mook</a> named King Mosh, who is absurdly powerful and very difficult to solo even for massively overleveled players &mdash; basically THE Boss of this whole race of Bosses In Mook Clothing. And yes, he too can jump you and is not drastically different from other Devilsaurs. Albeit classified as "rare", meaning his respawn time is fairly long, he is usually there because his mediocre loot is not worth the time and effort needed to kill him.
</li><li> Sons of Arugal, scoring bonus points for looking a lot like regular enemies in the same area, but being as tough as their brothers found in a nearby dungeon. <em>And</em> being ten levels higher than anything else in the area. Fortunately, their numbers were cut back somewhat in a patch.
</li><li> Fel Reavers, being seventy-feet tall mechanical constructs that blot out the horizon, sound like a freight train piling into a factory of tubas, and shake the landscape for yards around with every step. They seem about as stealthy as a sumo wrestler wearing full plate mail trying to tiptoe through a room of sleeping cats, but just you try and sit down and rest for a moment in the Hellfire Peninsula <em>without</em> experiencing that dread moment of looking behind you only to see an eclipse of black metal and green fire just close enough to ruin your day. As an aside, for a brief period during the beta, the Fel Reavers' models accidentally switched to that of a regular bear; with predictable results. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">More than a few lives were lost to the dreaded Bear Reavers.</a> Their scream is like a hellish pig squealing through Pink Floyd's concert microphone system. You never forget the first time you hear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">scream</a> as you start wondering why the ground is suddenly shaking. The Fel Reaver's horrifying roar also broke stealth in a massive range basically described as "if you can hear it". Cue a dozen regular mobs turning their sights on a rather surprised and very visible rogue who was sneaking past them to complete some quest.
</li><li> Another classification of monster is "rare", which only spawn once every several hours, can (usually with the higher levelled ones) take a concentrated group effort to down, and act as mobile loot pinatas. Rares are distinguished by the smaller silver dragon around their portrait. Finally, you can combine both types into the "elite rare" class, which has a big silver dragon around its portrait and usually a necklace of player skulls around its neck... One good example of a "rare elite" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend">Zaricotl</a>, though he was hit with a nerfbat in later patches and became just rare. Elite and terrifyingly overleveled for the zone, this vulture could tear players apart with ease. To add insult to injury, he had a unique property: after killing a player he would emote "Zaricotl seems much calmer now that it has eaten the remains of (player name)" and become temporarily non-agressive. That's right, he's not content with killing you, he also devours your corpse.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2i1r2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2i1r2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2i1r2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Both types of Rares (Rares and Rare Elites) have a silver dragon around their portrait. The difference is that the silver dragon of Rare Elites also has a wing.</span>
</li><li> The Storm Giants that patrol Howling Fjord may also count. Thankfully, they have <em>very</em> loud footsteps, so you can at least hear them coming from a long way off.
</li><li> Giants tend to be this in general. Especially dangerous are Sea Giants, mostly because they're arguably the most common type of giant. There are a quite a few wandering around Desolace, probably one of the first times you'll see them. But the waters of Feralas and Tanaris have veritable armies of them patrolling the depths and beaches.
</li><li> Garginox, the flesh giant in the Eastern Plaguelands. He patrols a single area for no apparent reason other than to screw players over. He's got nearly 28000 health and has dungeon endboss-like damage output. Worse, the area he's in is a questing area, and if you happen to be looking in the wrong direction, turns out he's much quicker and quieter than his mountainous size would imply.
</li><li> Although few and far between, regular nonelite mooks displaying this are not unheard of. As an example, the now removed Scalding and Boiling elementals were a nightmare to kill as a mage, since they were immune to Frost and ungodly resistant to Fire. Scalding elementals also had a powerful instant spell dealing heavy fire damage and stunning the target. Another elemental example, the nonelite rare Eck'alom (now nerfed) had a Freeze spell, a stun lasting 12 seconds, inflicting continuous damage and not breaking on damage &mdash; 12 seconds being more than enough to kill any player approximately its own level.

<ul><li> Komato Annihilators. 4.7 metre tall death machines (good luck trying to jump over it), they have a large arsenal of weaponry, a melee attack thrice as powerful as any other enemy's, so much HP that they seem invincible, and an anti-knockback system preventing you from stunning them. They give a huge amount of ammo and nano if killed, but often not enough to make up for the ammo you spent killing them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Yukabacera</a> from the same game is literally one of these. He looks like an ordinary Tasen Soldier, but he is even faster than Iji herself (who is supposed to be the fastest moving person in the game, mind you), has plenty of HP (50 to be exact) and has weapons that could only be given to someone with a Tasen Stat of 10 and a Komato Stat of 10. (The highest level any stats can be) Kill him, however, and you'll not only obtain tons of ammo and nano, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch">Scrambler</a> as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Big Eye (essentially an 80s-style telephone on a pogo stick) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Mega Man</a></em>. Sure, the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, but these things are three times as tall and wide as Mega Man, take an immense number of hits to kill (20 buster shots), are immune to many of the boss weapons, and take off a third of Mega Man's health bar with one collision. And they hop at Mega Man with impressive speed. The only way to get away from them is to run under them when they do an extra-big hop, which happens at random. It gets a <em>bit</em> easier when you get Ice Man's weapon, which freezes them in place for a few seconds, allowing you to either escape, or to switch to the P-Shooter and unload. Almost every <em>Mega Man</em> game since then had their own Boss in Mook Clothing, but none are as notorious (or stupid-looking) as Big Eye. Ironically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss">Warm-Up Boss</a> added to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em> is Proto Eye, a bigger yet laughably easier version of Big Eye.

</li></ul></li><li> Examples from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The Metroids themselves. They don't look like much, but they're a lot more agile than most enemies, are resistant to many attacks, and do a lot of damage fast once they latch onto you.
</li><li> In several games, Ridley has a pair of souped-up pirates as his guards. They're no real threat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>, they'll trash you easily if you don't know what you're doing.
</li><li> <em>Super Metroid</em> also has the armored Space Pirates encountered in Lower Norfair, who throw their limbs at Samus and leap all over the place. They can't be damaged until they're coaxed into performing a jump kick and even then they take a ton of hits to kill. On the other hand, with a little practice it becomes easy to keep them in their vulnerable state throughout the fight. Although they respawn, Samus only has to fight them once before the door they're guarding becomes permanently unlocked and she can just jump past them any other time.
</li><li> The Grey Space Pirates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em>. You can usually just run past them, but there are two you <em>must</em> defeat in the final escape sequence. Trouble is, they're much, much harder than regular pirates. Bad enough under normal conditions; <em>tragic</em> if you barely scraped past the final boss, which is likely in a low-percent run, and even more so in a 100% run, where the final boss is <em>greatly</em> leveled up. These two bastards caused more retries and general frustration than anything else in the game until a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.metroid2002.com/0/boss_tricks_black_pirates.php">good AI exploit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was found.
</li><li> The Golden Space Pirates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> are similarly painful. They are less fast and immune to less than the Grey Pirates, but can only be hurt from behind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The game determines this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">checking if Samus and the pirate are facing the same direction</a>, so firing at them and quickly turning around can damage them too.</span>
</li><li> From the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, the Baby Sheegoths, at least when you first encounter them. Can deal out huge amounts of damage, freeze you, take a serious beating, and are only vulnerable from behind. If you missed the Charge Beam earlier, you're going to break your thumb on the A button.
</li><li> Grenchlers, the Sheegoth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>, are even worse. They do even nastier damage than the Baby Sheegoths, their lightning attacks have greater range than the Sheegoth freeze breath, they can jump up ledges, and their shells have rather wonky hit detection, making landing hits with the Dark Beam even harder than normal. Even worse, you have to fight a number of them underwater before you get the Gravity Boost.
</li><li> The Fargul Hatcher from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>. It's in only one room in the game, and that's a good thing. It's only vulnerable while its mouth is opened&mdash;trouble is, it spews swarms of Fargul Wasps while doing this, and the wasps hunt you down. Meaning, 9 times out of 10, you'll be fighting the wasps more than the Hatcher. By the time the first swarm is dead, another will just be released. Last thing, the Hatcher itself has a ton of health.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MystikBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MystikBelle">Mystik Belle</a></em> has a winged lich-like demon in the Detention Dungeon that has ridiculously high health for a normal enemy, plus an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitingParticleShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitingParticleShield">Orbiting Particle Shield</a> that reflects Belle's fireballs until it is completely dispelled(after which you have only a narrow window for dealing damage), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">increases in strength the lower its HP</a>.
</li><li> The "Obsidian Enforcers" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a></em>. A few of them show up in the last few levels, and although their attacks aren't any harder to dodge than the normal enemies of their type, they have approximately 1.65 metric boatloads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>. It's entirely possible to empty the entire ammunition supply of a level 1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">RYNO IV</a> into one on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Challenge Mode</a> and have it survive. They don't get a health bar like the other type of miniboss, either, which brings up the truly horrifying thought that maybe they were just intended to be <em>regular enemies</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scaler">Scaler</a></em> has Dragon War Beasts, enormous monsters with several attacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">they're only vulnerable after performing a certain attack</a>, and gobs of health.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> II</em> has Tyranid Carnifexes, enormous, massively powerful creatures that will easily cleave through entire squads. There is one relatively early mission where the objective is the kill a Carnifex, and despite lacking any boss traits (special attacks and a health bar) it is just as difficult to kill. The Argus Gate mission &mdash; in which <em>three</em> Carnifexes attack simultaneously &mdash; without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Dreadnought</a> is very difficult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Gatling Groink from <em>2</em>. It uses a powerful bombing attack with a wide blast radius, capable of killing many of your Pikmin in a single hit. It can fire a long way and usually has a wide "territory," meaning it's capable of reaching your Pikmin almost anywhere. Your captains can't really kill it on their own, and it has a shield that prevents it from being attacked from the front at <em>all.</em> To make matters worse, its health actually <em>begins to regenerate</em> once you "kill" it &mdash; so it'll just come back unless you have your Pikmin <em>quickly</em> take it back to your ship, which does it in for good.
</li><li> The Adult Bulbear from <em>2</em> deserves mentioning as well. Unlike most enemies, the Bulbear will <em>actively pursue</em> your Pikmin once it runs into them. It <em>will not</em> stop until it is killed, and it can take quite a beating. Finally, it does the same health regeneration thing as the Gatling Groink, so you have to take it to the ship quickly, or you have to do the whole thing over again. Also, it's likely that you'll have to deal with Dwarf Bulbears along with the Adult, which will only increase Pikmin casualties. And in order to get 100% completion you have to, in a Challenge Mode level, defeat 3 of them without any Pikmin dying.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI">StarCraft: Brood War</a></em>, during the final Terran mission, the Overmind deploys the "Torrasque", a souped-up version of the Ultralisk and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>' Tarrasque. It's an appropriate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>, for the Ultralisk is already a powerful unit, able to survive multiple Siege Tank shots and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> a normal marine: the Torrasque simply takes these traits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, allowing it to tank a Battlecruiser's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> and still plow through even the most fortified positions. Worse, if it is killed, the Cerebrate in control of it simply respawns it a few minutes later. This makes it all the more satisfying when you can acquire your own Torrasque in one of the first Zerg missions and send him forth to single-handedly annihilate entire Terran bases. However, this one doesn't respawn if it dies, so take care not to let it take too many Siege Tank shots if you want to keep your super-Ultralisk.
</li><li> The Minotaur in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transarctica">Transarctica</a></em>. The Viking Union's ultimate armoured train looks like every other enemy train on the strategic map. However, even if it has no special abilities, its sheer firepower and hordes of soldiers it sends against you make it significantly more difficult to defeat that other enemy trains you encounter.
</li><li> Kul Tiras Admiral's Elite Guard in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a>: The Frozen Throne</em> optional campaign. In appearance they are almost identical to footmen (the basic infantry in the humans), but in fact are much stronger than the heavy units like Taurens or Knights.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhythm Game&nbsp;</div><div id="folder9" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a> IIDX</em> series (as of RED CS), there's Gambol Another, which has the exact same charts as the lower difficulties. The timing is so exact, that anything that isn't absolutely on target would be considered a "bad."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> has several songs that are <em>way</em> harder than their difficulty ratings (in the older games, ranked out of 10) suggest, mainly because of stamina, hard-to-read, or simply memorization:
<ul><li> Several songs that while not that difficult at first glance, become absolutely monstrous in difficulty. Why? Because your stamina will drop faster than a lead weight while playing it. "Flashdance: What A Feeling" (Level 8 Maniac in 3rd Mix) is the first of many, followed by "Sunkiss Drop" (Level 7 Expert in <em>SuperNOVA</em>).
</li><li> DDRMAX: "So Deep (Perfect Sphere Remix)" from DDRMAX is also a particularly infamous one; it's a 9 on Heavy, but its filled to the brim with tiring gallops.
</li><li> Near the end of the classic-scale era, songs that would have easily been rated 10 before were being rated 9 to accommodate the new <em>really</em> hard songs, and in the case of "Paranoia Hades", the Medium chart is rated <em>8</em> despite its difficulty.
</li><li> DDR Extreme: A couple of examples here:
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aqua" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aqua">Cartoon Heroes</a> (Speedy Mix)" from <em>DDR Extreme</em> on Singles Heavy. It is widely considered one of the most difficult 9-footers, if not the most difficult, in the entire series because it throws a wide variety of patterns at you, from gallops to crossovers to double steps to jackhammers to lengthy streams. Unless you're adept at each of these patterns, expect to fail this song over and over again. If using the DDRX rating, this would easily fall under a 14 or a 15.
</li><li> Daikenkai Double Challenge, like its Singles Challenge counterpart, looks like a cluttered mess, except it adds step patterns that don't flow to jumps randomly placed in uncomfortable areas. Though rated a 9, this is very close to being a 10. This is averted in DDRX as the chart overhauled re-rating is a 14, nearly equal to a boss song.
</li><li> The Least 100 Seconds Double Heavy, labeled as an 8. The crooked step patterns, combined with a very high speed makes it very easy to get thrown off. This is averted in DDRX as the chart overhauled re-rating is a 13 and later a 14 in DDRX2, nearly equal to a boss song.
</li></ul></li><li> The ultimate one is probably <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QIG7Gb62u4">Conga Oni from Universe 3<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; traditionally, the licensed songs tend to be the <em>easier</em> songs, and <em>don't have Challenge charts like <strong>that.</strong></em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em>: "Calling" is one of the hardest songs in Warriors of Rock on guitar <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yaxo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3yaxo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yaxo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Barring only "Sudden Death", "Fury of the Storm", and "Black Widow of La Porte"</span> but based on where it's located in Quest Mode, you'd expect it to be relatively easy. At least Quickplay doesn't attempt to hide the song's brutal difficulty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game tends to surprise players with songs that were easy on one difficulty mode yet shockingly tough on the next level higher. This is because typically a PiU chart will not share steps between levels. In short, any song can qualify if you weren't ready for it! A few especially notable songs include:
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/NR6feXqtSA0">We Are<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" from OBG is one of the songs you start the game with. Typically songs you start the game with are easy so newbies won't be so intimidated. Instead, "We Are" is chock full of strange body motions, relentless jump-step-jump combos, and reversing (occasionally randomized) running patterns. Many players dread this song anywhere, especially early in their song set due to how fast it can drain you. Oh, and that's on easy mode: it gets worse from there!
</li><li> "Canon D": This song is easy in normal mode which is why most people pick it as their first full-length song only to get steamrolled. Unlike in normal mode, all difficulties listed for the full song version of Canon D are actually <em>averaged</em> difficulties. The "level 9" version, for example, starts out around level 5 difficulty goes up a little at a time to around level 12. It's also more than twice the normal length with a difficulty spike at the end.
</li><li> "Get This Party Started" from Premiere EX 3 is a very good example of this trope. The Normal, Hard, and Free Style charts are standard for a pop song, but Crazy and Nightmare have not only a max combo of over 660 including long notes, but also patterns that to this day are still very difficult to play through! They're so bad, rumor has it Andamiro fired the guy who made them.
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/niT-Fg50zho?t=25s">Fantastic Baby<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>": Fiexta EX on 8 (hard). This isn't so much a song as a full set of drills for every skill you need on level 9. It's one of the few songs that will teach everything needed to level up, however, expect to be wiped out and/or injured until you actually get there. On the rest of the levels it's just a fun, energetic pop song.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> games have these occasionally pop up in the forms of songs that are waaaayyy more difficult than their ranking indicates. The most infamous is probably the DLC song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">"Constant Motion"</a>, which is ranked at tier 5 out of 6, but contains what is probably the most difficult guitar solo of any song in the game (of which there are over 1000). There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">"Can't Be Tamed"</a> which most players will probably dismiss as a cakewalk at first glance due to only being a Tier 3 and being a pop song, but the solo section is so difficult that it should at least be a Tier-4 category.

<ul><li> Emperor liches are a good example; they are powerful spellcasters and can damage the player's stats, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">summon numerous monsters</a> and cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Death Ray</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Diamond Golems</a> absorb every element and have very high defense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Molochs</a> will ruin primarily melee characters or characters with very low speed. Greater titans absorb every element, too, and shoot eternium quarrels (which hit <em>hard</em>) from a distance. Great Karmic Wyrms cast spells, are <em>also</em> immune to all elements, and hitting them makes the player unluckier with each hit.
</li><li> Water elementals, dragon turtles, and gorgons also qualify: a sufficiently tough character can pummel them to death in melee (in fact low-level gorgons are quite weak), but their breath attacks can mean instant death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope">Parodied</a> on <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130905221139/http://poro.tontut.fi/~adom/mkoddd/masterk.html">this page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which describes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot</a> monster with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Overly Long Name</a> and all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">most notorious abilities</a> of various monsters in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Of the many, many unique monsters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband">Angband</a></em>, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Sauron</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Morgoth</a> are mandatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battles</a>, and even they don't appear in specific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRoom">Boss Rooms</a> on the levels they guard.
<ul><li> More standard examples of bosses in mooks' clothing include the Drolem (one of the earliest max-damage poison-breathers, and one reason you don't go past 2000 feet without poison resistance; also drops a pathetically small amount of treasure), the Greater Titan (summoning, lots of HP, high-damage melee attack), and the Great Wyrm of Power (as the description says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">it can crush stars with its might</a>").
</li><li> A monster is represented on the screen by a letter. Each letter can represent different subclasses. So getting used to fighting one type of creature, and then seeing the same letter and thinking it's no problem only to have it turn out to be a much harder creature to kill is somewhat unnerving.
</li></ul></li><li> Though a staple in most rogue-likes, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona">Elona</a></em> has a particularly nasty variety of them.
<ul><li> Adamantium Golems are green golems with incredible power, defense, health, and damage-adding abilities. Note that up until this point, golems merely advance in power consistently. Don't mistake them for being this game's Incredible Hulk, however, they are actually his much more indestructible rival/ally Wolverine. By the time you land a second critical hit, which seems the only thing that will actually kill them, they may've healed up the damage from the first. In the lower levels, mutants qualify, as mutants spawn with A) a random amount of limbs, and B) totally random equipment, 30% of the time it is magical in nature. Woe to the player who discovers a three-armed mutant with an enhanced weapon and shield. Both of these are encountered more rarely than other random monster spawns at the same level. If in a dungeon whose levels randomly generate, the best course of action to deal with an adamantium golem is to zap it with a rod of teleport, then flee up or down the stairs and come back. Note that for the truly unlucky, any enemy in the game may spawn as a random dungeon's "last floor boss," making the Addies more terrifying still. See also quicklings, simply replace the abundance of defense with speed.
</li><li> There is also the Shub-Niggurath, a rare spawn at about level 25+ , who is pretty tough to kill. Luckily, they are only half-assed hostile, preferring to summon other creatures to do their bidding or hit you with mind-screw sanity-altering affects, as their name would imply. They only directly attack you if you engage them in melee combat. Their biggest danger comes from the randomness of their summons, as they may summon something that will mop the floor with you, even if you're to the point you can one-shot a Shubby. Like the golem mentioned prior. Still, that's an incomprehensibly rare occurrence. More often than not they may even summon neutral or friendly NPCs who will help you fight them off. It's all chance when dealing with these, really. Then, there are those rare instances of monsters that spawn with "&lt;&gt;" wrapped around their names. They receive the same boosts to stats and health that other dungeon bosses receive. Enemies with "&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;", or worse, "{}" are even more powerful, but fortunately are extremely rare.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EnterTheGungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EnterTheGungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The aptly named Mimic is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster">Chest Monster</a> that can be randomly encountered throughout the came, though finding one is rare. It replaces ordinary chests, and looks exactly like them, save for the occasional movements and lack of a keyhole. When interacted with or shot at, they reveal themselves to be mimics, and proceed to attack the player. Mimics are notoriously hard to kill &mdash; their high HP coupled with erratic movement patterns and high rates of fire make them difficult targets. This is magnified by the fact that the rooms in which chests are found in are the smallest rooms in the game. It's possible to escape, but Mimic are one of the few monsters in the game who can chase you through the rooms. The more valuable the chest, the more dangerous the mimic.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">Shelleton</a> enemy is this, though to a minor degree. It shows up at later stages, and often spawns in rooms full of enemies. It attacks using bullet arrays and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">roving laser</a> and can take a lot of punishment before collapsing into a little skull. What's more, if the skull is not destroyed soon, the Shelleton is revived, and it has to be killed again.

<ul><li> Teramid Fragments can appear as early as the first level, and they have a <em>ludicrous</em> amount of health for an early-game enemy. However, they don't attack very often. There's also a blue version that is much larger, has more turrets, attacks more often and has even more hit points.
</li><li> Nerozons (giant green and black ships) have a painful rapid machine gun, and take even longer to kill than Teramid Fragments.
</li><li> Megazons (giant red and black ships) have <em>4</em> deadly thunder cannons that can easily rip through your shields and your armor in seconds. They have even more health than Nerozons.
</li><li> Lastly, we have Final Guards (giant blue and grey ships). These fire a spread of slow shots in front... and said shots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">cannot be reflected</a> and do continuous big damage if you keep touching them. They have more than twice the health of a Megazon, by the way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a></em> literally has this at the end of each stage that doesn't contain the boss. A regular mook which just happens to be a mini-boss, taking more hits than usual, and sending extra enemies out at you.
</li><li> A few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> stages feature a "death fairy"/"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom">doom</a> fairy", a single normal-looking enemy with a health bar and attacks comparable to most boss spellcards. Notable ones are one in Stage 4 of <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em>, one in the Extra stage of <em>Imperishable Night</em>, and <em>two</em> in Stage 6 of <em>Subterranean Animism</em>, all right before the boss. Lily White in <em>Phantasmagoria of Flower View</em> is not too hard to evade on her own, but when you're dodging her attacks in the middle of a fight against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Shiki</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">eiki</a> in the midst of a Level 4 attack and a crapload of portals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">that spawn sticks whenever a bullet passes by</a>, you better have a bomb ready.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyrian">Tyrian</a></em> does this often, with several levels having you take on wave after wave of boss-caliber enemies (although fortunately in most cases you don't actually have to destroy them and can just stay out of their way until they leave the screen)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> games every now and then have random enemy pilots without the distinctive aces' callsign in the target display who nevertheless prove unusually hard to hit or shake off. It's one thing for clearly demarcated aces to give you grief, and another thing for no-names to come close to, say, Yellow 13's level.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatXSkiesOfDeception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatXSkiesOfDeception">Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception</a></em> plays with this in the mission "Operation X" that lets you go up against various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> superfighters. The mook part comes from how they are piloted by normal, un-codenamed pilots <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> except for Scarface One and ZOE Commander</span>. Of course, since they are in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> superfighters...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatJointAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatJointAssault">Ace Combat: Joint Assault</a></em> has AEGIS ships. They look like normal cruisers from afar but their twin SAMs have a much greater lock-on range than those on normal ships. Unless you grinded, you usually won't have unlocked long-range missiles to take them out with and they will almost always fire before you can, even going full afterburner.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X3: Terran Conflict</a></em> introduces a weapon called the Plasma Burst Generator, which averts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlamethrowersSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlamethrowersSuck">Video-Game Flamethrowers Suck</a> trope so hard that it turns generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirate</a> fighters into Bosses In Mook Clothing. Many are the forum threads where new players complain that they can't win against pirates with PBGs.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CCGImportanceDissonance">CCG Importance Dissonance</a> often makes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> games rife with this. Many games feature major characters using the same mishmashy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeDeck">Theme Decks</a> that they used in the series, while random civilians are using Decks that could beat those same protagonists six times over. <em>Stardust Accelerator</em> is particularly heavy, since every Duelist has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomPowerRanking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomPowerRanking">a rating</a> that supposedly tells you their skill, but compare the deck of Randsborg, who has a rating of around 1200, with that of Fudagawa, a random prison guard with a rating of 741.

Initially, they only appear in scenes where the goal is to escape (the first enemy you come across is a Gekko), but they can be fought and there are mandatory set-piece battles with them later in the game, most of which are before you get the game's specific anti-Gekko weapon.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3">Metal Gear Solid 3</a></em>, if you trigger an alert at the cliff near Groznyj Grad (by sniping the patrols in the base), helicopters will be sent after you. Unlike the earlier ones, these have powerful attacks and it's nearly impossible to hit them with rockets. Fortunately, these helicopters don't have to, and most likely won't be encountered. And they only spawn in areas where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Snake can man a gun turret.</a>

<ul><li> Therazinosaurs in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinoCrisis">Dino Crisis</a></em> are ludicrously powerful and very hard to put down with any of your conventional weapons. If you don't have any poison darts when you encounter these things, you are <em>screwed</em>. Worse yet, the game tricks you into thinking they're a one-off miniboss battle when first encountered, only to find out that they're a standard issue mook from that point on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">FEAR</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has the tough REV mechas which appear occasionally, they fire barrages of missiles, have twin miniguns and can take several shots from the rocket launcher and/or particle beam weapons. And more frequently, there's the Heavy Armor soldiers, a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mook</a> which has ultra-heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and usually carries either a Penetrator rifle (which damages you clean through your armor) a particle cannon, or a rocket launcher. Later expansions feature ones with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">miniguns</a> and riot shields. <em>Project Origin</em> throws Heavies with laser rifles at you, too, who can kill you in a couple of seconds if you're out in the open. Thankfully, most of the Heavy Armor soldiers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">terrible shots</a>, making them somewhat easier to kill. Of course, that just makes it even worse when you get to the ones with lasers, because, inexplicably, they have excellent aim and fast reaction time, meaning that if you don't use cover, they'll cut you to ribbons quickly. They get a lot worse in the third game: they are now equipped with shields that can absorb tremendous amounts of punishment (like two full clips of shotgun ammo at point-blank range), and they can teleport through walls, which they put to excellent use in sneaking around where you aren't looking. The only mercy is that they are no longer armed with lasers, rocket launchers, or miniguns...just the Penetrator rifle.
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> are the Replica Assassins, which are relatively rare and much tougher and more damaging than normal enemies in spite of their small size.
</li><li> <em>F.3.A.R.</em> introduces Phase Casters, which have ridiculous shields (thankfully non-regenerating), a laser rifle similar to those used by the Heavy Armors, and they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">teleport groups of soldiers</a> into the battlefield. <em>Very</em> irritating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> introduces the poison headcrab zombies. Have loads of HP, and can fling up to <em>three</em> poisonous headcrabs at you, each one capable of nullifying your HP to 1 in one bite. If you're going for a Gravity Gun only run of "We Don't Go to Ravenholm" make sure you have something heavy to throw, <strong>especially</strong> when Fast headcrab zombies are around.
</li><li> Hunters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a>: Episode Two</em> are absurdly brutal, able to absorb entire clips of ammunition without flinching while constantly firing explosive fletchettes, and if they get close (which they will, as they are almost always fought in confined areas) their melee attacks will swiftly chew through Gordon's health. And the damn things <em>travel in packs</em>. The only respite is their crippling weakness to stuff hurled by the Gravity Gun, killed in three or four hits, or lightly tapping them with the Muscle Car downgrading them to "mere" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>.

Giant Race-X monsters with ungodly health, incredibly powerful electrical attacks with area of effect damage, and the ability to self-destruct upon death. Late in the game, you come up against a massive horde of them, in a completely black sewer tunnel.
</li></ul></li><li> Crimson Heads in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease">REmake version</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> spawn when the player kills a zombie, but doesn't burn the corpse, or isn't lucky enough to inflict a kneecap blowout or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">Boom, Headshot!</a> first. The result is that the zombie gets back up again as a creature that is even tougher than before, can run nearly as fast as the player, and has a very lethal clawing attack that can kill the player in a couple of strikes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> Regenerators. They are encountered late game and can kill Leon very easily, namely with a lunging attack, and like their name suggests, they can regenerate limbs and are nigh-unkillable <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unless if you bring the thermal scope and kill the Plagas inside of them</span>. The only consolation is that they are painfully slow and are rarely encountered.
</li><li> When Plagas start bursting out of the Ganados heads, both forms are not to be trifled with. One has razor tentacles that make knifing impossible and the other can ( and probably will) lop off Leon's head, resulting in a game over. Thankfully those mostly useless flashbangs will kill them instantly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StateOfDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StateOfDecay">State of Decay</a></em> has a number of 'Freak' zombies, about half of which qualify as this. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">SWAT and Army</a> zombies don't really count, since they're only immune to bullets, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedGame">you'll be trying to avoid anyway</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Bloater</a> is slow and has a single, relatively-easy-to-escape suicide attack.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Juggernaut.</a> The Feral can be run over (albeit with a little more difficulty if it manages to dodge) or executed from a distance with a firearm. Not so the Juggernaut; trying to run it over will just cause severe damage to whatever vehicle you're in and knock the Juggernaut down for a second or two (and this is the only way to knock a Juggernaut down; Ferals can be knocked over by a body shot), and it can essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">shrug off</a> anything short of an artillery bombardment. Also, it can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock">Stun Lock</a>, cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaximumHPReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaximumHPReduction">Maximum HP Reduction</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantKill">bypass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a> just like the Feral; the Juggernaut's major distinction is that unlike the Feral, which deals rapid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> during its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock">Stun Lock</a>, the Juggernaut can kill in two bites.

They look the same as regular dolls except for a slight color change.

<ul><li> The first major expansion to the board game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror">Arkham Horror</a></em> features the titular Dunwich Horror. If you can't prevent its arrival then a seemingly normal monster tile is added to the game. One with a laundry list of special rules. The Dunwich Horror has tons of health, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">can advance your doom counter</a>, and a deck of cards that randomize its combat stats, drawn <em>after</em> you enter combat with it. On one turn it takes half damage and destroys all your gear, on the next it has no special resistances but instantly kills you. Defeating it gives you any card you wish as a reward.
</li><li> The Adamantine Horror in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, found in Monster Manual 2. It's not quite a mook, but you'd be forgiven for thinking a robot spider the size of a small dog were one, particularly given the tendency for Clockwork Horrors to move in packs. It's CR 9, which is "tough, but not world-destroyingly powerful," about the power of a frost giant. It'd be a decent miniboss encounter for a mid-level campaign &mdash; or so you'd think. The Adamantine Horror has a great 28 AC and 22 SR, none too shabby hit points and melee attacks, and three spell-like abilities, which it can activate at will: one that instantly destroys all your magic items, one that instantly disintegrates you, and one that causes one person per round to <em>implode.</em> It's hurling around abilities that the players don't get for another eight levels. Clockwork Horrors in general have elements of this, such as the Platinum Horror's overcharged lightning bolts, but the Adamantine Horror takes the cake &mdash; it's very rare that it won't take at least two party members and a fortune in gold down with it. Dragons in 3.X were deliberately designed to be incredibly strong for their CR, so that fights with them would be more special. This is okay when the DM knows about it, but a more inexperienced DM could well attempt to use dragons as garden-variety <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook">Smash Mooks</a>, then be shocked when it flies over to the wizard and kills him in one hit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/ImperialAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/ImperialAssault">Imperial Assault</a></em>, before the official Errata in late 2015, Royal Guards were extremely powerful generic units for the overlord that spawned in pairs in any mission. They move very fast, have long reach, dealt high damage with a good chance to stun a hero, and were extremely tough to take down as long as they were next to each other thanks to a passive shared defense buff, making them a huge threat that the heroes had to deal with. And even if you did kill one, it would just cause the other one to deal more damage, and the overlord could just respawn it on the next turn since it was a generic unit. The units also ended up dominating the PVP side of the game, so FFG changed the card so that their passive buffs don't work on each other and toned down their damage output so now they are much easier to take down and much less threatening.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has cards that seem like Mooks at first &mdash; not too expensive and not too strong at first sight &mdash; but are actually monstrously powerful due to certain factors (or in a certain deck build). Particularly notable is the <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=31825">Psychatog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which can grow monstrously powerful. And then there is a <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397682">Tarmogoyf<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a card so innocent-looking that many even a competent players dismissed it as irrelevant on the first glance. Even resist for a while when they are told it has proven to be one of the best, if not THE best creature in whole Magic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, wasp swarms at low levels can simply obliterate a low-level party. They can move as fast as the fastest PC's and fly, so they will catch everyone (it is inevitable the PC will hit difficult terrain). They are only vulnerable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> effects and are immune to weapons, so low-level PC's have almost no effective means to damage them. PC's hit by the swarm must make a save which is very difficult for low-level squishy casters or spend their next round doing nothing but gagging; the tough characters who can generally make the save are those who usually have weapons and thus cannot harm the swarm at all. Drop a wasp swarm or two into a game before mid-levels and the chance for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> are quite high. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeeAfraid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeeAfraid">Bee Afraid</a>, be very afraid indeed.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, monsters that fall under an army's Rare choices often fit this, since they can easily be more powerful than the units leading the army depending on how the lord/hero is kited out.
</li><li> Occasionally show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>.
<ul><li> Thousand Sons Aspiring Sorcerers that hit almost as hard as a full-blown Chaos Sorcerer despite being a squad upgrade for a Troops choice, especially with the new Force Weapon rules.
</li><li> Incubi Klaivexes have a better offensive statline than most armies' HQ choices and some downright <em>scary</em> weapons.
</li><li> Necron Pariahs who while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">drastically overpriced</a> can still hack up most anything with ease.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Grey Knight Paladins</a>. Two Wounds, toughness 4, 2+/5++ save, Feel No Pain, <em>nasty</em> weaponry...horridly expensive, but one Paladin outmatches most HQ choices.
</li><li> Tyranid Broodlords, which 4th edition codex were an HQ choice, in the 5th edition was reduced to an upgrade to unit of genestealers. While changes in the codex have made it less dangerous overall, those didn't include it's statline, which is higher than what most <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HQs">H Qs</a> get, and in the 6th edition, the new universal pyskic powers it can get make it an absolute killing machine in challenges.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a></em> is prone to this with its soak system. One encounter with Black Spiral Dancers may have your werewolfs cutting through them effortlessly; the next time, ONE Dancer may take an HOUR of combat time, if their soak rolls are good and the player's damage rolls are low.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Person Shooter&nbsp;</div><div id="folder17" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The lambent gunkers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a> 3</em> qualify. At first they appear to be about as squishy as your average lambent, until you realise they have more health than anything that isn't a proper boss, no apparent weak points, a massive, arcing ranged attack that often makes cover useless, pinpoint accuracy at any distance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">even when they can't see where you are</a>, and a huge melee attack that completely ignores cover. Their very presence will instantly shift the battlefield into a frantic dodge arena, and the fact that they're capable of wiping your entire squad on their own is made even more annoying by how they are almost never alone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy">Jedi Academy</a></em>: The Reborn Masters are non-unique opponents and "just" an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">elite version</a> of Force-using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredMooks">Superpowered Mooks</a>, but they can be more difficult than most bosses. They have practically every Jedi ability and use them more intelligently and significantly more effectively than their ordinary counterparts. They seem to have fewer hit points than bosses, but are hard to hit in the first place and can kill you quickly. If you choose the Dark Side plot, Jedi masters and swordmasters are similar as opponents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> has a few, ESPECIALLY on higher intensities.
<ul><li> The first one you'd likely encounter is through a gate requiring intensity 5 or higher in the FIRST LEVEL, meaning it's much harder than it might be if encountered normally with a lower intensity in a later level. The Crawler is massive, and its attacks are choreographed, but they have to be dodged at the very last second. Not only that, it has a weakness on its back, the only way of damaging it. It already turns to face you if you strafe from afar to get to it and shoot, and if you do it from close up it'll spin to knock you away and deal massive damage. It becomes easier as you get better at the game and get betters, but can easily come as a nasty surprise, even being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a> in Mook Clothing.
</li><li> The second is the Reapers. Encountered in Chapter 4, they're a nastier upgrade from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> they were in the first game. If they see you, or you touch them or attack them, they'll, as predicted, summon reapettes, which the game points out and acts as if it is the real danger. Not so. Unlike in the first game, they start chasing you too, becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a>. And when they reach you, their frustratingly hard to dodge Scythe swipes will take off a huge portion of your health and knock you back really far. That doesn't mean the reapettes AREN'T dangerous. They always follow, even if you dodge them once, and inflict poison.
</li><li> In the same level, Palutena points out an inconspicuous wriggling boulder-like skull she wants you to avoid, and for good reason. Bother it (read: attack it, which is very easy to do by accident if you're using a weapon that shoots through things), and it bloats into a giant one eyed human heart with muscular skull handed arms. This is a Clubberskull; it will chase after you, unflinching from anything you throw at it, until it gets close enough to knock you a football field away. If you land safely (which is unlikely in the first level you encounter it), congratulations, it'll likely take one more hit to destroy you. They even become REQUIRED ENEMIES a few chapters later, including fighting one in a narrow hallway with no room to sidestep.
</li><li> Later on you get the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Forces of Nature</span> equivalent to the Clubberskull: the Clobbler. It seems easy enough, looking like a happy little cherry plodding along. Bothering it at all, however, makes it bloat into an incredibly Grotesque Strawberry. Thankfully, unlike the clubberskull, there's never any time where you have to fight it head on, the situations where it is present put you in a good position to take them out unharmed, though if you're playing on Higher Intensities you should still watch out.
</li><li> What is almost the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Aurum</span> equivalent is the Baglo, first appearing to be a normal structure, but if fired at suddenly opens up and reveals a wall of circular guns that let out a constant stream of lasers, giving you no time to fight back as you're constantly dodging and running low on stamina. And its health is on par with that of bosses. You definitely need a truly powerful weapon to take one down.
</li><li> Then there's the Fort Oinks, truly late game mooks that end up becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">Flunky Boss</a> in Mook Clothing. True to form, it actually doesn't appear that much, but is considered a standard enemy despite taking a lot of damage and doing a lot of damage AND spawning a lot of enemies.
</li><li> Lastly, on higher intensities there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster">Mimicutie</a>. You try to open a chest, Bam, Mimicutie. Instantly, they'll give Chun-Li style lightning kicks that will likely stun lock you until you go flying, at which point it spins along the ground to you to try to kick you while you're down. If you try to stay from afar, it'll just keep spinning towards you, likely too fast for you to get away so you'll try to dodge it, only to get hit when the dodge ends because the attack lasts for a while. Trying to take it down with melee likely won't work either, as you'll be stuck with the lightning kicks. Your only hope is to somehow get behind it when it's doing so, but you probably won't be doing any damage if you picked a range heavy weapon like a staff.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Seeroses and Gardenies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03">P.N.03</a></em>. The former is considerably tougher than the standard mooks and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">Charged Attack</a> that will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> you at your starting stats, the latter has even higher HP and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnRed">Turn Red</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> you if you take too long killing it.

<ul><li> Rovers are basically only beatable with special weaponry,and even then,they can stun and kill you all too easily.
</li><li> Mudflaps,which appear late in the game,are the stuff of nightmare,being able to turn your allies into mooks,killing them in the process (and it's undodgeable and instant-kill if you're alone).If you kill them without Overdive Kill, <em>their spirit lives on and will proceed to possess one of your soldiers to revive itself</em>
</li><li> Worms are a nightmare to fight,especially when they're not alone.If you shoot their weak point with a sniper,they become more aggressive and their weak point is null from this point on.Their instant-kill attack is just the tip of the iceberg with those guys...

Massive Transformers whose alt-modes are huge tanks. Basically, think Omega Supreme Jrs. and you're on the right track. The only difficulty they're at all simple to deal with on is easy.
</li><li> The Romanov robots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish">Vanquish</a></em> are twice as big as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Gorgies</a>, have high HP and durability, and are armed with missiles that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">blow Sam across the room</a> and instantly send him into critical mode, sweeping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster">Chest Blaster</a>. Later versions have dual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">miniguns</a> and homing missiles, flamethrowers, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">launchable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsADrill">drill arms</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> has a few of these.
<ul><li> Grineer Napalm. Tough as nails, fires rockets that inflicts massive damage, can set you on fire and will knock you down. These rockets are also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">Always Accurate Attack</a>.
</li><li> Grineer Bombard. A Napalm who doesn't set you on fire. Instead he just blasts you with a grenade launcher. Over and over.
</li><li> Grineer Hellions. Grineer soldiers with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">Jet Pack</a> that can hover in the air (therefore out of range of your melee attacks) and attack you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a> that can kill even the tankiest frames in seconds.
</li><li> Grineer Heavy Gunner. A tall, gangly cyborg woman with a machine gun that can cut through your shields and health in seconds, and is quite tanky; players generally use Heavy Gunners as training dummies for their sheer resilience.
</li><li> Corpus Nullifiers. They have a bubble disabling your powers if you're in it and protecting all allies within it from them, and this bubbles also blocks gunfire (though it shrinks if it gets hit).
</li><li> Corpus Sapping Ospreys. Flying drones that fly very fast, are very small and thus hard to hit, and drop mines that can kill even a max leveled frame in seconds.
</li><li> Corpus Tech. Tougher than your average corpus, armed with an energy machine gun that takes 2 seconds to wind up. If you let him live for two seconds without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover">hiding behind terrain</a>, you can kiss all your shields and health goodbye.
</li><li> Infested Ancient Healers. They turn any of their allies within range into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>. And if they spawn as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Eximus Units...</a>
</li><li> The Corrupted (enemies from all factions under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>) include Corrupted Nullifiers, Corrupted Ancients, and Corrupted Bombards.
</li><li> Sentient <em>anythings</em>. They have high HP and armor, which would be trouble enough given the insane damage output they have, but what takes the cake is that once a Sentient has lost a certain percentage of their health, they gain an absolutely ridiculous <em>ninety-five percent</em> damage reduction to the damage type that hurt them most... which will trigger again when they lose more health for the second highest damage type, a third time for the third highest, and a <em>fourth</em> time for the fourth highest. All these resistances stack. In addition, an un-damaged Sentient can copy these resistances over to itself should it get the chance, and when first encountered, there is no indication how tough they are. There's barely a hint that a player should spread out their damage types at all, meaning that the first pair of generic Sentient combat drones they meet are likely to wipe the walls and floor with them. Later on players gain an abilty to reset the resistances, but that still does nothing about their boatloads of health and damage.

Oh, and if it gets to the end of the screen, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">lose the level</a> regardless of health. You'll need a few instant-use heavy damage weapons along with many powerful units in order to beat a single one without losses.
</li><li> The Garguantuar is easily the most powerful mook zombie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a></em>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">slow</a>, but can crush most plants (including defensive plants), takes a shitload of damage, and can even take 2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> attacks. Finally, it can throw an imp in the defenses after losing enough health.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</a></em> has a mechanic which allows you to build bossmooks. the 'Throw' skill usually allows you to reposition enemies and allies on the map quickly, but if you throw an enemy onto the same square as another enemy, they combine their levels (keeping the class of whichever was originally highest, but learning any new skills it would have at that level). You can quickly build a very innocuous looking Lv400 monster to decimate your Lv20 party unless you exploit battlefield conditions to whittle it down while keeping out of harms way, rewarding you several dozen levels worth of experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red Chocobos is a rare enemy unit with a hard-hitting attack, Chocobo Meteor.
</li><li> Black Chocobos. Regardless of them of having low HP and speed, their Chocobo Pellet does even more damage if you can't evade it. Dragons, Tiamats, and Behemoths can also be a pain. Then there's the Baraius Hill rare battle. You get attacked by a team of dragons, tiamats, <em>and</em> behemoths at the same time. Accidentally getting the encounter is a valid reason for a reset.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> Draco Zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>. These undead dragons have a boatload of HP and have very powerful attacks that can also hit from a distance if you try to send your magic users after one. They're rarely seen outside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Lagdou Ruins</a>, though.
</li><li> <em>Mystery of the Emblem</em> and its remake features two cases: A Fire Dragon will come out of a cave in Chapter 7 if you get too close, and it's stronger than anything you've faced before, even stronger than the actual boss of the chapter! Then an <em>Earth Dragon</em> (the same class as the final boss of the first game) shows up in Chapter 20, and attempting to fight it is generally a recipe for suicide. There's a way to get rid of it without actually fighting it, but it requires you to defeat the actual boss of the chapter (who's no slouch) first.
</li><li> Manakete in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">Binding Blade</a></em>, due to their stat boosts. The first one appears as a boss, like the Draco Zombies, which is easy enough because they lack ranged attacks and he won't move from the throne, meaning your squishy mages can exploit the low Res and take him out quickly. However, by the Nabata level, there are several on the map that will move next to your aforementioned squishy mage and destroy her. The penultimate level is composed <em>entirely of Manakete</em> in an enclosed space, meaning they can easily target your weak units; thus, you're forced to kill at least three with each turn or take your chances.
</li><li> The Mercenary with the Leather Shield in Ram Valley <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemEchoesShadowsOfValentia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemEchoesShadowsOfValentia">Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</a></em>. The Leather Shield makes him bulkier than every other enemy on the map, and he's fast enough to double attack everyone in your party (thus giving him crazy offense for that point in the game). If none of the Ram Villagers were promoted into a Mage in order to bypass his defense, a <em>lot</em> of creativity and effort will need to go into taking this guy down.
</li><li> After the timeskip in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>, if any named character has been recruited, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with the exceptions of Lorenz on Azure Moon, Ashe on Verdant Wind, and both on Silver Snow,</span> they will be replaced with a "General" enemy (or "Knight of Seiros") with equivalent stats and loadout. This also applies to the Chapter 7 mock battle, where poached students will also be replaced with a "General." Aside from their different name, the replacement characters will also trigger the boss theme.
</li><li> At the end of Azure Moon route in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>, Myson is one of the enemies in the final boss stage. He uses a generic Warlock model, and not particularly tough... but he's positioned in the middle of several Demonic Beasts, and packs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">Bohr X</a></em>. Nothing quite like a 10-range <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HpToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HpToOne">HP to 1</a> attack in a game where permadeath is considered standard, and there's still the issue of the final boss flinging long-range fireballs at you too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Sunrider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Sunrider">Sunrider</a></em> has Nightmares, ancient Ryuvian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">Ryders</a> that are the toughest non-boss enemies in the series. Each Nightmare has more hit points than a PACT assault carrier, maxed-out armour, maxed-out shields and very high evasion, so not only are they tough as nails but they&#146;re also hard to hit. All of their attacks are highly accurate and highly damaging as well. And they usually come in groups of at least three, with several Ryuvian cruisers to back them up. Fortunately, they can only be encountered in optional side missions.
</li><li> Mykene grunts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z3</a>: Jigoku-Hen</em> all have double move, 12k+ HP and can deal about 4k damage and one shot Gundams/Reals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> has the Sectopod, a 10-meter tall Spider Tank that can utterly ruin an unprepared squad. It has the highest hit points of any enemy (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Ethereals and Uber-Ethereal</span>), and <em>'Enemy Within</em> gives it a trait that halves all damage received. It has a massive main gun that can fire twice each turn and does more damage than anything but a MEC particle cannon. There is rarely more than one on each mission, but they are always accompanied by a cohort of Drones to repair any damage you manage to inflict. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">The sequel</a> makes them even scarier, as they now have a whopping four points of armour, enough to reduce all but the most powerful attacks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>, and can stand up to instantly gain height advantage on any opponent it faces.

<ul><li> Hunters start off this way &mdash; they're tough but manageable alone, but in groups, it's generally best to just get out of there &mdash; but are demoted out of this status as you get more powerful. Shortly thereafter, the Leader Hunters step in to pick up the slack.
</li><li> Super Soldiers, at first glance, are just larger versions of the human troops the player has been slaughtering by the truckload throughout the game. Actually treating them as such results in the player's attack being interrupted with a grab, followed by some horribly damaging wrestling move and getting tossed across the room like a ragdoll. And they can follow the player up buildings like Hunters and have an innate virus detector that sounds an alert in under a second.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em>:
<ul><li> Brutes are 8 foot tall musclebound <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">lightning bruisers</a> who take buckets of ammunition to kill, even with headshots, and wield heavy weapons such as flamethrowers and miniguns. The fact that they deal massive melee damage makes them a pain to deal with even after the Boss has reached endgame, since there are no upgrades to reduce melee damage.
</li><li> The gang specialists also count early on. The Luchadores' specialist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> who wields a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeSpam">Grenade Spamming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a>, the Deckers' specialist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> who skates around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">dual wielding</a> rather powerful SMGs and a shock hammer, and the Morningstar's specialist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Cold Sniper</a> whose rifle can take out a significant chunk of the player's health.

Only appearing when you gain the full wanted level, Wardens use the same abilities that you have, and take a lot of punishment to kill. Fittingly, they have their own theme when they appear.

Bazooka and grenade launcher users, while also capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a>, at least went down in one shot from the Desert Eagle or sniper rifle, usually with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">dismemberment</a>. Chainsaw guys? Multiple shots, making them fairly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">implacable</a> in the otherwise fairly realistic title.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Wyverns</em>. Thousands of HP, constantly home on you, high attack power, and won't stop pursuing you <em>even if you teleport away</em>. The console version introduces the Arch Wyverns, which are even more powerful.
</li><li> 1.2 patch introduces various randomly spawning tough enemies in the Dungeon. Especially deadly is the Paladin, who has more HP than all pre-hardmode bosses bar the Wall of Flesh and the Eater of Worlds, sports a titanic 50 defense (more than 4x that of the Wall's 12), and deals triple digits of damage in melee and a ranged hammer attack that passes through walls.
</li><li> The Goblin Summoner of a Hardmode Goblin Invasion has 2000 HP (where all the other goblins have only around 100), moves around a lot, and can shoot powerful shadowflame projectiles. Despite all this, she's only considered a regular enemy, dropping banners instead of trophies.
</li><li> Pirate Captains. They look similar to other Pirates, and in the heat of battle, it's easy to not notice a Captain at first. They have 2000 HP and are armed with a machine gun and a cannon.
</li><li> The Rune Wizard, an ultra-rare Hardmode enemy found underground. It can not only teleport, but it's also powerful enough to kill most players in a few hits, and has absurdly high contact damage.
</li><li> The Ice Golem, a semi-rare monster that only shows up in Hardmode blizzards.
</li><li> Eyezor of the Solar Eclipse, a zombie with a single giant eye and loads of health, gets faster as it takes damage, and shoots lasers with increasing frequency as it takes damage, Retinazer style.
</li><li> Nailhead of the Solar Eclipse, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser">Pinhead</a> expy that sports 4000 HP and sprays nails in all directions when damaged.
</li><li> Mothron of the Solar Eclipse, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Mothra</a> expy that has 6000 health, flies around to charge into you, and lays eggs that spawn smaller copies of itself.
</li><li> The Headless Horseman during the Pumpkin Moon has the highest HP of any non-boss enemy in the game (10,000!).
</li><li> The Yeti of the Frost Moon has quite a bit of hit points (3500) but hits for 160 base damage, 30 more than the Headless Horseman.
</li><li> The Hallow, Corrupt, and Crimson Mimics are the bigger, stronger brothers of the regular Mimic: They have 3500 HP, are much more aggressive, and can even go through walls, but can drop unique weapons and accessories. You can also spawn them yourself by placing a special key in an empty chest, but you better be prepared before you do so.
</li></ul></li><li> The Enforcers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Watch_Dogs</a></em>. Their durable armor, advanced weaponry and persistence to kill the player make them the most formidable enemies in the game. There's an ability to incapacitate them like regular enemies, but it's expensive.
