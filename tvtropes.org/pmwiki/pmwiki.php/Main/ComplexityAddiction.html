<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aizen has an infamously bad case of this, considering he's shown to be strong enough to just take whatever he wants through his combination of brute force and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Story-Breaker Power</a>. During the Soul Society arc, he had a very complicated plan to obtain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. When that (inevitably) failed, he simply walked up and took it. Why he didn't do that in the first place? Addictions are a strong force to be reckoned with. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later justified as he revealed his goal during that arc wasn't JUST to acquire the Hogyoku (which he'd already known Rukia had), but to set up an extreme training regime to groom Ichigo into a suitable opponent through which he could further strengthen himself.</span>
</li><li> The Hueco Mundo arc is where he really succumbs to it. Aizen builds up an army of Arrancar, hollowfies Tousen and makes war with Soul Society. While Aizen has an ability that could let him easily defeat the entire Gotei 13, he more or less deliberately gets everyone but Gin killed for no real reason aside from it being more complex than simply single-handedly killing everyone with his overwhelmingly unfair powers personally. More idiotically, the only point the army could have possibly served beyond intimidating Soul Society was to serve as cannon fodder against Squad 0, the only real threat to Aizen's plan at this point. Aizen didn't seem to notice this, and thus made the creation of the Arrancar army <em>completely pointless</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mostly justified in that the army itself was just a smokescreen to buy time for the Hogyoku, which Aizen thought would make him invincible, to truly awaken, as well as to keep attention away from Wonderweiss, the one actually integral Arrancar that was in truth the specifically-designed trump card against Genryusai Yamamoto. A portion of the army also served as additional training for his envisioned punching bag Ichigo.</span>
</li><li> When she first used Resurrecci&oacute;n, Harribel displayed the necessary speed and power to get around Hitsugaya's defenses with her sword, and could have ended the fight at literally any point. Instead, she spent the entire rest of the fight playing tug of war with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">water powers</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">ice powers</a>, evidently attempting to set up some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">super attack</a>.
</li><li> Zommari had a case that rivaled Aizen's. Instead of just using his body and mind-controlling powers to kill Byakuya and everybody else in minutes, he insisted on toying with him, twisting the knife and explaining every aspect of his powers in tiny, minute detail, giving Byakuya more than enough information and time to overcome them and turn things around. Byakuya even keeps pointing out that he could probably just kill him at any point. Byakuya does sacrifice his arm when Zommari aims his power at the Captain's head, though Byakuya allows him to keep taking control of body parts and slicing the tendons for no apparent reason but being too arrogant to use Bankai until he's out of limbs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: In episode 39 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Baron Ashura captured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> Kouji and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Mazinger-Z</a> and gave him the "join-us-or-die" choice. After Kouji's predictable answer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Ashura sentenced him to death</a>, and instead of shooting him, Ashura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> started a bunch of giant power saws and drills to cut Mazinger-Z to pieces (it must be mentioned that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Hell</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Count Brocken</a> were waching the scene and Brocken told he would just shoot him).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, several antagonists are fond of taking roundabout paths despite being capable of achieving their goal much more easily with less effort:
<ul><li> Uchiha Madara's Moon's Eye Plan to "save" the world involves dragging everyone into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">endless illusion</a>, which requires him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchThemAll">capture nine tailed beasts</a>. The only person who could stand in his way is the First Hokage of Konoha village, Senju Hashirama. However, Madara can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">effortlessly defeat</a> all the <em>other</em> villages, and take control of their tailed beasts. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">with his fearsome reputation</a>, he could even get the tailed beasts by just asking. With these tailed beasts on his side, he could tilt the scales in his favour in the fight with Hashirama, and thus take the last tailed beast who was in Hashirama's possession.
</li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> Instead, he challenges Hashirama straight away with only <em>one</em> tailed beast (albeit the strongest of them), gets killed, but not before biting off some of Hashirama's flesh. He gets himself resurrected with a technique he had set up in advance in case this happened, goes into hiding, then implants Hashirama's cells into his wounds, which eventually activates his Rinnegan. Unfortunately, by the time the Rinnegan activated he was already an old man and thus in no shape to fulfill his plan. To compensate, he sneakily implants the Rinnegan into the eyes of Nagato, an orphan boy from the Rain village. He then sets up an incident which causes <em>another</em> young boy (who later takes the alias Tobi) to lose half of his body, then takes him in, and heals his body using the above-mentioned Hashirama's cells. He follows this with another setup which triggers the young boy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, which convinces him of the Moon's Eye Plan. Then, Madara dies <em>again</em> after telling him to recruit Nagato, then capture those nine tailed beasts, following which Nagato would use the above-mentioned Rinnegan to resurrect Madara <em>again</em>, who would <em>then</em> set the Moon's Eye Plan in motion.
</dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tobi</a> plans to carry out the aforesaid Moon's Eye Plan for his own ends, with no intention of ever bringing Madara back. It would thus make sense for him to capture the nine tailed beasts by himself, which he was capable of doing within months. His wood release powers, derived from Hashirama's cells, give him top-class offensive and defensive abilities. His sharingan makes him intangible and allows teleporting himself and others into his pocket dimension. These powers make it very difficult for him to be defeated in battle, and even if he is pushed into a corner, he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">teleport out of the battlefield</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillMeetAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillMeetAgain">try again</a> under more favourable circumstances. Instead, he spends 17 years setting up the Akatsuki, with much less capable subordinates, then sends <em>them</em> to capture the tailed beasts, and then starts a world war to capture the last two tailed beasts.
</li><li> In the Konoha invasion arc, Orochimaru has caught Sarutobi by surprise, grabbed hold of him and placed a kunai against his neck. Rather than kill him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">right then</a>, he backs off, makes a speech about what it feels like to fight against your own teacher, and then summons the souls of the previous Hokages (who were Sarutobi's teachers) so that Sarutobi could experience what he just talked about.
</li><li> In the Pain's assault arc, Nagato/Pain invades Konoha to search for Naruto. He eventually pins down Naruto after having flattened Konoha earlier. There's nothing else left for him to achieve, so rather than simply return with the captured Naruto, he presses one of Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> which causes the Kyuubi inside him to go on a full rampage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says he did this mostly to "test" his powers against the Kyuubi.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume">Muteki Kanban Musume</a></em>:
<ul><li> Miki as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, displays this when at episode 3A when she insists on fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> when she could easily avoid it. And at episode 5 B, she insists of beating Ohta to use him as a stepping stone to escape a well, when Ohta had a rope and Miki could&#146;ve just let him rescue her, she simply handwaves it.

But the absolute worst example he came up with was in episode 21, where he decides to kidnap every single doctor in the world, which would apparently cause everyone to realise how fragile they were, and make the entire human race loose the will to live.

Apparently just soliciting the help of a trainer or an expert, like Professor Oak, never occurred to him, since he sets out on a ridiculously circuitous plan that involves kidnapping children, levelling Ecruteak, imprisoning the Legendary Beasts, attacking places all across Johto, and antagonising the Gym Leaders of Kanto and Johto.

<ul><li> The characters have an odd habit of trying to string together some crazy strategy to win, rather than just using their strongest cards to stomp face. A good example is Harald in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>, who tries to bring out three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Aesir</a> and then trigger the Gjallerhorn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">banish them all</a> after three turns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">deal an insane amount of damage.</a> Predictably, Yusei sabotages the activation such that Gjallerhorn does 0 damage and the Aesir are banished for nothing. Had he just ignored Gjallerhorn and left the Aesir on the field, he would have won handily.
</li><li> This is more deliberately done with Leo/Rua, who (especially early on) loves to wrangle together crazy combos to pull off a fairly impressive field. However, this usually ends up wasting all his resources and leaving him with a field that's nowhere near as invincible as he thinks it is, and many of his strategies seem to be made under the assumption that the opponent won't do anything to stop him.

Thus, these two teen genius behave like utter morons when it comes to interacting with each other, as they both concoct a series of ever-complicated plans to force the other to confess, like checking the weather report, coming to class on foot instead of by car or bike, then pretend they don't have an umbrella when it rains so that the other person will offer to share one to walk home together with (see, they can't offer first because that would show affection and weakness), <em>then</em> when neither can reveal they have their own umbrella, they begin manipulating the other to admit they have one.

Part of the reason Batman works himself to exhaustion to capture all of the Arkham escapees is because he assumes some or all are in on Bane's plans.

Now, Superman has two options: A) tell Jimmy the bad news and revoke the adoption to protect him, or B) consider that the oracle has problems with homonyms and conclude that it may be referring to the sun in the aforementioned solar system.

<ul><li> In the first movie, he has Austin and Vanessa standing on a platform suspended over a pool of water with mutated, enraged sea bass ready to eat them, in a secluded room with the door closed and one easily defeated guard stationed there. Dr. Evil's son, Scott, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">usually the one who calls him out</a> on these things and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution">states much easier ways</a> to kill Austin.

</li><li> In the second film, Dr Evil uses a time machine to steal Austin's mojo (rendering him impotent) rather than (as Scott suggests) simply shooting Austin at a time they know Austin will be occupied. Furthermore, when Dr Evil has Austin at his mercy, he has him and his partner Felicity placed in a room with slowly retracting floors over a pit of lava. Much like the first film, one inept guard is stationed there.
</li><li> In the third film, Goldmember has Austin's father Nigel at his mercy, but much like Dr Evil, he fails to kill Nigel outright. Instead, he leaves him to die on a smelter. As is typical, the plan fails.

Therefore he comes up with a complicated plan of action, involving her entering, counting the number of steps she takes from the entrance, counting how many civilians, guards, etc. there are, and him then calling her via the lobby phone to plan further ahead. This is explained via Jason's voice-over as we see her doing this. As she looks at the telephone, the camera cuts to Jason outside, dialing the number. No answer.

So Qui-Gon hatches an elaborate plan involving tricking Watto into gambling the part in an upcoming Pod Race and then entering Watto's nine-year-old slave Anakin into the race and having him win it for him. Even though the movie makes it pretty clear Qui-Gon's Force powers meant he knew Anakin would win, you'd think there might have been an easier (and less dangerous) way.

This is highlighted by the fact that, per Vader, Imperial Intelligence <em>knew where the Rebels were assembling their fleet</em>. A strike right then and there by a couple dozen battle squadrons from the local sector fleet could have crippled the Rebellion. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Palpy was more interested in seducing Luke to the Dark Side than in winning a military victory</a>, and kept pursuing his overcomplicated plan even after it became apparent the Rebels were not playing ball. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in the spin-off novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em> Darth Vader thinks Palpatine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> is outright <em>stupid</em> (though naturally, he keeps it to himself).

Having survived his death in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> by transferring his spirit to a cloned body using his master's "unnatural" dark side teachings, he finds that his clone bodies are unstable and very quickly degrade, making him full on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport">Dark Lord on Life Support</a>.

Never mind that within the first five minutes of the film, Kylo, a young man already fully immersed in the dark side <em>and</em> the powerful grandson of Anakin Skywalker, was willing and prepared to kill Palpatine as it was.
</li><li> The plan to rescue Han from Jabba the Hutt at the beginning of <em>Jedi</em> is also ridiculously complex, to the point where there is still considerable debate among fans as to what the original plan was, and how much was planned and how much was improvised, or if there were possibly several different plans going on at once. First Lando infiltrates the palace as a guard, then Luke sends the droids to Jabba as a "gift", then Leia arrives disguised as a bounty hunter with Chewie as her prisoner, then Leia frees Han from the carbonite but is discovered and taken captive, then Luke arrives and attempts to negotiate only to be forced to fight the rancor, then Jabba gets mad and sentences everyone to death, then they're taken to the Sarlacc Pit, then they kill everyone and go home. One wonders why any step besides that last one was necessary. Luke does seem to want to give Jabba the opportunity to resolve things peacefully, but that still makes everything that happened before Luke arrived pointless.

His heist plans are so complicated that each minion he hires has a separate tens-of-pages document listing their part of the plan and the contingencies they are to use depending on what happens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Voldemort's biggest flaw (besides underestimating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>) is wanting everything he does to be as epic to as possible, regardless of practicality. Several characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> this weakness.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Goblet of Fire</a></em>, Voldemort sends a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">Mole</a> to Hogwarts to kidnap Harry so as to use his blood in Voldemort's resurrection ritual. They do this by taking a full year to build the mole's false identity, force Harry to participate in the Triwizard Tournament against his will, rig the tournament to let him win, and enchant the trophy to teleport him to the ritual site. The mole apparently does not think to use his trusted position of authority to whack Harry over the head, shove him into his magic chest, and smuggle him out of Hogwarts in the first week of class. Or to make any random object into his office into a Portkey, invite Harry in, and arrange for him to touch it.
</li><li> It's even pointed out that given Voldemort's status as the Evil Overlord of the Wizarding world, he could use <em>any random Witch's or Wizard's blood</em> for the ritual (it simply requires "blood of the enemy"... who outside of Voldemort's followers is <em>not</em> his enemy?), but no, Voldemort is obsessed with it being Harry, since he wants Harry's magical protection from his mother's sacrifice in his blood. There's also the problem that the ritual only requires Harry's <em>blood</em>, not his presence -Voldemort's agent could have gotten that in the first week. A visit to the Mole's office, a scratch on anything in the office (There is the whole "forcibly taken" thing, but that could be gotten around by arranging for Harry to get in a fight in which he picks up some cuts and scratches), gathering the blood, a memory charm, and using the ability of the human memory to rewrite itself to compensate for the minimal amount of time lost -bam. Voldemort can then go after Harry at his leisure, without anyone but his followers being aware he's alive!
</li></ul></li><li> Harry only survives through books 4 on because the revived Voldemort demands a grandiose and wand-induced death. When Voldemort actually kills Harry in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Book 7</a>, it doesn't stick. Voldemort actually tries to kill Harry as soon as he sees him near the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Book 5</a> when he shows up unexpectedly after Harry had thwarted the Death Eaters' plan. Luckily for Harry, Dumbledore intervenes just in time. When, in Book 6, the Death Eaters actually <em>have Harry at their mercy,</em> Snape stops them by reminding them that Voldemort wouldn't want somebody else to kill him. Though, admittedly, Snape has other reasons for what he does. Furthermore, Voldemort, who is an adult with a supernaturally powerful body, insists on killing Harry, a physically ordinary teenager, via magic, which is repeatedly shown to be ineffective. Had he instead decided to try killing Harry by stabbing, clubbing, or simply using his bare hands, he'd have almost certainly succeeded due to not having any obscure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">never-before-mentioned laws of magic</a> blowing up in his face.
</li><li> Voldemort's ego prevents him from using inconspicuous objects as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">horcruxes</a> or storing them in random places, so no one will ever find them (such as making one of his Horcruxes a single grain of sand in a desert). No, he has to, for example, use his grandfather's ring and hide it in his grandfather's shack. So, people who know things about him, such as Dumbledore and Harry, can reason out what the horcruxes are and where to search for them. And these are the objects on which his obsessed-over immortality hinges.
</li><li> One is discovered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">book 6</a> to be stored near his childhood orphanage in a cavern that can only be opened with a blood sacrifice, across a lake that can only be safely crossed with a magical boat that can hold a maximum of one adult human, at the bottom of a basin full of a torture potion. Since he provides the boat, that particular piece of his soul can be stolen by anyone with a bit of obscure trivia about Voldemort's youth and a judicious choice of partner &mdash; Dumbledore takes Harry, who at 16 isn't quite an adult yet, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Regulus Black takes a house elf, which Voldemort had forgotten to ward against</span>. Dumbledore is immensely disappointed that Voldemort's grandiosity and sadism overrode his common sense: he made the defenses degrading and horrific at the expense of making them actually lethal.

</li></ul></li><li> This seems to be the generally accepted MO for the Yendi (a cultural group whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a> is being scheming and secretive) in novels set in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em>. For example, in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Yendi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Yendi">Yendi</a></em>, the Sorceress in Green arranges for Vlad's rival Laris to try to take over Vlad's territory in an obviously clumsy manner so that Vlad is on his guard when Cawti and Norathar try to kill him so that Vlad's allies in House Dragon will kill Norathar in a way that dishonors them all so that the next Dragon Emperor or Empress will be a person inclined to make the Sorceress's friend Sethra the Younger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon Warlord</a>. In the event that the assassination fails (which it does), the deliberate clumsiness of the previous attacks causes Norathar to find out that Laris set her up so that Norathar will kill him in a manner that dishonors her, which would also take her out of the line of succession. This secondary plan also fails.
</li><li> A major aspect of the White Court of vampires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> is that they <em>don't</em> operate with simple, straightforward plans. In the White Court, approval and influence is based partially on the way one maneuvers against one's opponents, both within the Court and outside of it. A White Court vampire could simply have an enemy gunned down, but that would be met with serious disapproval and a loss of respect and grace, while taking that foe down via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> is viewed with admiration. It's <em>institutional</em> Complexity Addiction. Another, equally important reason, is that they work in and around human society far more than many other supernatural beings in the Dresdenverse. Hiring a gunman to shoot your rival can be easily traced back to you. Subtly goading another rival into a conflict with the first so <em>he</em> hires the gunman insulates you from the consequences far better. White Court culture has grown up around this principle, with the most respected actions being those that "everyone knows" you were responsible for, but nobody can connect you to with any sort of actual evidence. They also apply this to supernatural beings stronger than themselves.

In <em>Right Ho, Jeeves</em> Bertie informs Jeeves that his plan, viz dressing Gussie Fink-Nottle up as the devil and sending him to a fancy dress party to romance a girl, is far too elaborate to ever work. In fact, Gussie forgets the address of the house it's held at and botches the whole thing. Even so this says more about Gussie than about the complexity of the plan.

She and the young man, instead of just meeting up during the day in a secluded spot, decide to trick the woman's husband into thinking there's a flood coming, sit on the roof in tin tubs, scare the husband into closing his eyes/passing out for the entire night, then go into the house for a little love-making. The complexity ends up paying off&mdash; when the husband comes to again, he's hollering that the flood is coming, and all his neighbors think he's nuts, making him permanently discredited. Yes, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Older Than Steam</a>.
</li><li> The Assassin's Guild in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> simply hates coming across as...<em>inelegant</em>. It's part of the job description, after all; a man with a crossbow killing someone for money is just a thug if he doesn't do it with <em>class</em>. This is the reason Sam Vimes is able to foil repeated assassination attempts from the Guild. They always attack him at home or the office, never out in the street ("What, like some common murderer?"), and they always wear full black, which, while cool, is fairly impractical for nighttime stealth (as anyone trained in camo knows, mottled grays or dark greens are better, while dark blue is most useful at night; black just outlines you). Vimes' home and office are riddled with cunning booby traps, the butler is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a> and Vimes himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">has no compunctions about fighting dirty</a>. This is also why Jonathan Teatime is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyBadExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyBadExample">Deliberately Bad Example</a> of an assassin &#151; his kills don&#146;t have class but rather slasher-villain levels of unbridled psychosis.

Since this is pretty subjective, it tends to result in "You lost."/"Oh, but did I?" type conversations.

Run out of guesses and be transformed. As long as you guess correctly, you get endless guesses. The King's steward even points out how stupid this is, especially in that he <em>color-coded</em> the victims. The Nome King insists that it's more fun this way, and even brags about how he's going to transform the heroes. Ironically, the discussion is overheard by Billina the hen, who uses the information to great effect.

Rather than just use a skilled cat burglar, Moriarty stirs up political trouble so there's a demonstration outside the embassy when the time comes to do the theft. It turns out that Irene is working for the head of the Ruritanian secret police who was in danger of losing his job because the country was so peaceful, but Moriarty has now fixed that.
</li><li> In the children's series <em>The Peterkin Papers</em>, the Peterkins are all extremely intelligent, even brilliant&mdash;but without a lick of common sense. Whenever a problem presents itself with a simple solution and a complex solution, they'll go for the complex one, and the simple one will never even occur to them. Without the common-sense of their neighbor, the Old Lady from Philadelphia, there's no telling how much trouble they'd get into!

When Kelly/Clark comes up with a relatively simple plan to get a special ops team into North Vietnam and the generals and admirals keep wanting to "spice it up", he specifically points out that the more complex the plan, the more things you need to go right, and the more difficult it gets for it to go according to plan. He draws deliberate parallels to the Song Tay raid (which actually happened in real life) and how the plan was almost thuggishly simple yet extremely effective. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13npr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13npr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13npr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It still failed, but that was because it took so long to get approval to make the raid that the prisoners were all moved by the time the Army got there</span>

Instead of simply mobbing the vampires the instant they know of their murderous intentions (Edward knew instantly, as he could read minds) or keeping Bella and her father together and putting her under constant surveillance so they could kill the vampires when they attacked (there were seven Cullens to keep a look out, one of whom could see the future and another of whom could read minds, all against two vampires, since the third defected), they decide to split themselves up so that Esme, Rosalie, Edward, Emmett, and Carlisle go on a wild goose chase after one of the vampires while Alice and Jasper take Bella first to her home in Phoenix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">after telling the vamps that want to kill her that that's where she's going</a> and then plan to take her to other major cities.

So naturally he spins it out across the entire book, making her hallucinate her dead father, knocking her out with a drugged card and chasing her through an empty library, trying to drive her off the road, attempting to turn her against Patch, and giving her a bogus spell to have him banished to Hell.

It helps that half of his plans boil down to "sow chaos and then present actual goal as solution to whoever ends up on top so they just hand it to you".

Apparently all that was a better plan than casting an enchantment on Belle (they use magic to make her miss her father, so it's not like they couldn't do that) or even having the asylum owner forcibly commit her directly. Keep in mind that the last petal falls from the rose that very evening, so really they would have succeeded in making the curse permanent simply by having Belle spend the night tending to her father!

How did he do it? With a bomb that was stuck to the bottom of the inside of a mailbox with a special type of glue that would hold out for a few months, meaning it would be delivered on a time release, after which it would go off when it finally got into the deliveree's hands. The possibility of it being delivered to the wrong address, of the victim moving, or of the bomb detonating too early or not at all don't seem to occur to Brian.

She sends Ward and Fitz on a mission to disarm a weapon that has fallen into terrorist hands, with the promise that they will be extracted afterward before S.H.I.E.L.D.'s takeover of the facility. In truth, however, there is no extraction plan and Ward and Fitz are likely going to their deaths. When Coulson confronts her about this, she merely states that they couldn't spare the resources. In the end, Coulson decides to go against her orders and take the rest of his team to rescue Ward and Fitz. Hand then reveals that she intended for him to do this all along... which begs the question of why she didn't just order Coulson to extract Ward and Fitz in the first place, since that's apparently what she wanted and (at least as far as the viewers are aware) it's not like Coulson and the others were really doing anything at the Hub to begin with.

Apparently, she felt the need to unleash the Beast, make Connor think he was responsible for the apocalypse, have sex with him, blot out the sun, bring back Angelus, release him to generate even more chaos and possibly kill the Beast, which serves her, then give birth. Alternatively, she could have had sex with Connor, told Angel, "I need some time to think", and left the city for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressDelivery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressDelivery">month or two</a>.
<ul><li> One possible justification for this is that actually <em>required</em> the deaths the Beast caused to bring her forth, and that Jasmine lacked full control in the early days. This would also explain why "Cordelia" had a nightmare (which the audience saw her having inside her own head) about a monstrous unknown demon&mdash;that <em>works for her</em> and she told to show up.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> Franchise has this in spades. The first few episodes of the original show tend to have fairly straightforward crimes. But as the show went on, just watching Crime Scene Investigators find the same kind of evidence to solve crime would get routine, so the crimes got more complex, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>, Patsies, and more convoluted methods of murder that would leave less direct evidence behind.

The same effect is common amongst other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> shows, with the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> having a similar thing. Later seasons criminals have far more complex delusions and psychosis and commit far more complex crimes than the early season criminals.
<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber">CSI: Cyber</a></em> involved a man who wanted to murder the witnesses whose evidence had put his father in prison. The obvious solution was, or course, to become one of the most skilled players of an online first person shooter, use his hacking skills to remove inventory items from accounts of some of the other top players (who had to be adolescents living in the same city), befriend these players by gifting them replacement gear (hacked from yet more players), spend hours a day playing with them to gain their trust and then use them to unwittingly courier disguised firearms that he had ordered from the deep web and hide them in appropriate locations so that he could later retrieve the guns in order to shoot his targets. The point of all this was apparently so that the firearms would be untraceable but that is hardly the only challenging aspect of planning a murder and given the insane complexity of the plan it is difficult to believe that he couldn't have got hold of the illegal guns some other way (plus of course the cyber team are able to track him down anyway).

<div class="indent"><strong>Moriarty:</strong> That's your problem: you always want everything to be clever.
</div><ul><li> In Series 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sherlock claims that this in turn was all part of an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> cooked up by him and Mycroft to bring down Moriarty and his organization. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">If that was really Sherlock</a></span>.

</li></ul></li><li> Played for laughs in "The Hounds of Baskerville" as John rants on how Sherlock ruined a game of Cluedo (the British version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Clue">Clue</a>) because he kept insisting the killer was Mr. Black...<em>the murder victim</em>.

When the other Go'auld simply wanted to bomb the planet, he mocked their lack of style, saying "You're all so stuck in your ways."

Over the course of the episode Kate comes to realise that the various military and political wonks in the White House Situation Room, including herself, are so used to dealing with crises that they've gotten themselves locked into a near-perpetual crisis mode that leads them to over-complicate every situation to at times truly ridiculous and even dangerous ends. Case in point: a couple of hunters accidentally crossing the border and finding themselves in a stand-off with Canadian police almost becomes a war between the United States and Canada because everyone involved reacts as if this is a major international incident requiring a military build-up, sabre-rattling, complex back-door diplomatic negotiations and lots of serious complex stratagems instead of just a couple of schmucks who got lost and bumbled their way into Canada. Kate eventually resolves the situation by... falsely telling the hunters that hunting season is over and if they don't knock it off and surrender themselves they'll lose their hunting licenses.

Many of his plans appear to be in direct conflict with each other, and it's been suggested that he doesn't actually <em>have</em> an ultimate goal. In fact, a popular fan theory is that Tzeentch has a LITERAL complexity addiction. If he ever wins, that is to say becomes the utterly dominant Chaos power and overruns reality, then there will be no more schemes for him to enact. Which will mean he ceases to exist at the very instant of his victory. That's why so many of his goals are in opposition to each other &mdash; he cannot afford to ever actually win, but nor can he cease trying to.

<ul><li> Before the Horus Heresy, Primarch Roboute Guilliman criticised Primarch Alpharius of the Alpha Legion for this &mdash; Alpharius' elaborate plans may in narrow terms have been highly successful, thoroughly crushing all opposition with limited losses for his legion, but they were also wasteful in time and resources (not helped by Alpharius' tendency to sometimes take counter-productive actions like warning enemies and giving them time to fortify solely to make his victories look more impressive).
</li><li> Alpharius' overly complicated plots also extends to his Legion. In the wake of the Horus Heresy, the remnants of the Alpha Legion have kept up their guerrilla war against the Imperium of Man, with many of their tactics boiling down to absurdly complex long-term plots which are so labyrinthine that it can take them centuries to see any resuls. However, said results are often devastating, such as infecting the inhabitants of a Space Marine chapter's recruiting planet with a long-term memetic virus that causes half the chapter to suddenly turn traitor with no warning a century later.

In order to appease them, they can perform Acts of Villainy that pander to their patrons' urges. Intentionally leaving clues to attract heroes to oppose you, setting up a fiendish death trap and gloating about your plans before leaving them for dead are all acceptable. Better still, you are rewarded whether or not you are successful; thus, rebellious Infernals can intentionally set themselves up to fail, in order to escape punishment for not doing their jobs.

This is most notable in the hamster he has to get into shape for <em>Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box</em>, where Layton collects seemingly random junk to put in the critter's cage. Layton also likes to explain things to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">Luke</a> in the most confusing way possible. It's a good thing Luke is almost as good at deciphering messages as Layton. The villains aren't much better - in particular, Descole's convoluted schemes to find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Azran sites</span> before Layton, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> protect them from Targent</span>.

</li><li> General Viggo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FurFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FurFighters">Fur Fighters</a></em> opens the game by gassing the Fur Fighter village, knocking them all out cold with sleeping gas. He then kidnaps the children as hostages and transforms the spouses into mutant monsters to guard key locations. The reason for not killing the titular heroes who are currently helpless? Because that always went badly in the past. By the end of the game he decides to stop with all the clever plans and just use brute force.

The solution, instead of just crashing through it with a vehicle or cutting the power nearby, is to go kill a bunch of truckers, steal their fuel truck, kill a bunch of cops when they come to stop you, drive out of your way to a nearby power plant, kill everyone there and crash the truck into the power plant to destroy both, before returning to climb the un-electrified fence.

</li><li> The PS2 FPS game <em>Daemon Summoner</em> has a stealth level which requires you to sneak on board a ship, and despite it being close to your starting position and only having one guard, you have to take the most roundabout and out of the way path imaginable to get on board the ship by sneaking through a warehouse, up a ridiculously long staircase and over the roof.
</li><li> One complaint levied against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfDestiny">Shadow of Destiny</a></em> is the ways the main character avoids death seem like an excuse to abuse time travel. A video game magazine cited one scenario: the main character, Eike, is standing next to a tree when he is killed by an assailant who was using the tree to hide. Because of the circumstances of the game, he can move through time to prevent his own death. His solution? Go <em>back to when the seed was first planted and prevent the tree from growing</em>, thus rendering his assassin's mode of concealment moot. The solution the magazine proposed? Just not stand next to the friggin' tree.

She gets so focused on the means to her ends, that she sometimes forgets the ends themselves. This is also a reference to how Beatrice's magic works in the setting - Beatrice and Kinzo describe magic as a kind of gamble, with a high-risk, high-reward system in place. Beatrice's plans are so convoluted to try and ensure that high reward, but it has the disadvantage of distracting her from her goals if she gets too into it.

Even his class (multiclass Fighter/Thief/Sorcerer specializing in enchantment spells) is the same as a Bard (his twin brother Elan's class) but more complicated.
</li><li> His father, General Tarquin, has a long-running scheme to rule the Western continent by acting as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> to one of the assorted petty kingdoms in the land while his friends manipulate two other kingdoms, occasionally letting them fall and moving onto another one. But he only resorted to that plan after straightforward military force failed. Later, he writes off one of Nale's plans as "having too many moving parts."
</li><li> Xykon is the opposite of this trope, having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">simplicity addiction</a>. He sees no point in creating elaborate plans or strategies when he can simply bombard an enemy with high-level spells or a target with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">thousands upon thousands of Hobgoblin soldiers</a>. In Xykon's case, it's not just a matter of laziness. To him, not needing plans or strategies to defeat his enemies is the ultimate expression of power. He also has a extreme disdain for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites">uppity wizards who treat sorcerers such as himself as magical imbeciles</a>. Thus the above simplicity addiction is one of his ways to continually reject the wizard's way of life by succeeding with only the minimal of planning and intelligence. That's not to say his plans are stupid by any means. By creatively using a single spell he manages to destroy a very large chunk of the Sapphire Guard who are guarding the throne room. He also spends a significant amount of time crafting or acquiring magical items to make his chosen tactics more effective and cover his weaknesses.
<div class="indent"><strong>Xykon:</strong> Planning doesn't matter. Strategy doesn't matter. Only two things matter: force in as great a concentration as you can manage, and style. And in a pinch, style can slide. In any battle, there's always a level of force against which no tactics can succeed.

This isn&#146;t after managing to exploit his addiction in order to fake his death by attracting the Simpsons to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>, then being convinced to trigger it so it will go off in his face, and wiring it so it will be a non-fatal explosion.

</li><li> Yet on another occasion, Sideshow Bob decided to steal a <em>nuclear bomb</em> and threaten to detonate it unless television stopped broadcasting in Springfield. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">He busted this plan</a> by picking a 1950s vintage bomb that was no longer operative, purely because of its "retro" value and despite the fact there were plenty of modern bombs as his disposal. Then he tried to kill Bart and Krusty in a murder-suicide... using the 1903 Wright Flyer.
</li><li> In a Treehouse of Horror story, Homer learns that Moe has an emerald. He tries to get it by tricking Marge into marrying Moe and then he'll kill Moe and marry Marge to get the emerald. Homer says that the plan's best part is its simplicity.

Fortunately, he has a time machine. How does he use it? Option A: Go back in time to that morning, cross the street before the parade starts. Option B: Go back in time one day, tell his troops the attack is postponed until Friday, when the parade won't be blocking the street. Option C: Go back in time one week, and move the device to the other side of the street, so the parade won't be an issue. What he comes up with is Option D: Go back <em>several hundred years</em> and sabotage the formation of Plymouth Plantation so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThanksgivingDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThanksgivingDay">Thanksgiving Day</a> never happens, and therefore the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThanksgivingDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThanksgivingDay">Thanksgiving Day</a> Parade will not exist to keep him from crossing the street. He opted to try to alter centuries of history, possibly creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyEffect">Butterfly Effect</a> that would cause the city he wanted to conquer to never exist in the first place, just to remove a temporary <em>traffic obstacle</em>.
</li><li> Perennial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DastardlyWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DastardlyWhiplash">Dick Dastardly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">is the king of this trope</a>. In his first appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em> he would always come up with elaborate plans to cheat his way to victory. Here's the kicker: he didn't need to do this at all. His car was <em>several times faster than anyone else's.</em> He could have won every race legitimately with ease, and in fact, each race begins with him surging to a huge lead. But he always stops in order to set up traps, which invariably end up backfiring and costing him the race. This pattern of behavior would carry on to all of his many other appearances: no matter who he's going up against, Dastardly's complexity addiction is his greatest enemy. He even refuses to win legitimately: he's such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> that he can't stand to win if he didn't cheat while doing so.
<ul><li> Another fine example was when Dastardly was given his own spinoff series. It revolved around him concocting ridiculously complex plans and inventing insane flying machines, all <em>to catch a pigeon.</em>
</li><li> Also, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop">The Perils of Penelope Pitstop</a></em> kept seeing the titular character captured and put into overly ridiculous deathtraps. Granted the guy responsible wants to inherit her fortune and is probably trying to make it look like an accident (hence the reason he doesn't just shoot her), but some of them just get outright absurd, and after putting her in whatever trap he just runs off rather than sticking around and making sure it works.
</li><li> Lampshaded by Penelope (after having been captured and informed how the latest death trap will work): "That's not very diabolical." (after having been told the elaborate way it will be triggered) "Now THAT'S diabolical!"
</li></ul></li><li> A heroic example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingChanAndTheChanClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingChanAndTheChanClan">The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan</a></em>, Tom Chan will often suggest needlessly elaborate plans such as deploying a series of mirrors to examine a statue (when Anne can just climb the tree and look through a pair of binoculars) or catapulting them over a wall (when the gate's open). Mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.

<ul><li> Phineas and Ferb are prone to this as well. For example, in "Picture This", Ferb has left his skateboard in England:
<div class="indent"><strong>Phineas:</strong> I know! We could create a highly-intricate and sophisticated machine that will transport any object from anywhere on the globe to our backyard! <br><strong>Dad:</strong> Well, why don't you just build a new skateboard? <br><em>[Phineas and Ferb stare at him in silence]</em> <br><strong>Phineas:</strong> Hmm, yeahhh, I don't think so. <br><strong>Ferb:</strong> If it's all the same with you, Father, we're going to build the machine.
</div></li><li> For Phineas and Ferb, it's literally an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalAddict">addiction</a>&mdash;Phineas goes into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantBelieveItsNotHeroin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICantBelieveItsNotHeroin">withdrawal</a></em> when they're forced to climb a mountain the normal way, with no crazy inventions, in "Bully Bromance Break-up". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Ferb holds up a little better, but that doesn't mean he likes it</a>.

</div></li><li> Candace too. In the Christmas special, she decides that to make sure she gets Jeremy the perfect gift, she's going to trick him into writing a letter to Santa and then read it; she laughs and calls Phineas ridiculous when he suggests she just ask Jeremy what he wants.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> villains succumb to this, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">every episode</a> ends with either them or the members of Mystery Inc. giving detailed explanations of how they were pulling off what they were doing, and why.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> episode "Mystery Solvers Club State Finals": the villain (revealed to be <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFunkyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFunkyPhantom">The Funky Phantom</a></span></em>, of all people), goes into <em>excruciating</em> detail about how he carried out his plot, which turns out to be an overly-complicated way of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting rid of his team so he can stop being a sidekick</span>. This <em>could</em> be justified by the fact that the whole episode is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">just a fever dream Scooby's having</a>, but still...
</li><li> In the following episode, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a>'s plan is even more complicated, and more pointless. The Gang lampshades this.
</li><li> The reason why is generally something along the lines of "scare everyone else away so I can do what I want in the area," often involving treasure. Simply buying them off would work just as well, and would not attract people with an interest in ghosts.
</li><li> In the <em>Mystery Incorporated</em> incarnation the fact that everyone's plans involve costumes and monsters is overall lampshaded/explained by the fact that Mystery Cove is famous for hauntings, and the overall plot involves as cursed treasure (That would be a very strange curse). Everyone just uses monsters because everyone acts as if monsters are real until the reveal, the townsfolk, lead by the money grubbing mayor, never think to prove the monsters are real, they just try to make money off of them, justified by their tourist economy/haunted history. The whole thing is not always complexity addiction, sometimes it is a reasonable way to take advantage of everyone's unreasonable behavior. Though unless they are hiding something there is almost always an easier way.

Notably, the one time it <em>wasn't</em> a hobby but an attempt to steal back his fortune after he was cheated out of it he went for a simple plan (use his extreme sport abilities to steal everything back piece by piece while pretending to be poor) that nearly succeeded. And when Kim was about to catch him his son Se&ntilde;or Senior, Junior <em>succeeded</em> with another simple plan: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">claim the bounty placed on his father by the guy who cheated them out of their fortune and then hire a lawyer to take everything back</span>.

<ul><li> An earlier episode had Roger enacting a scheme to steal a $10 pair of gloves, which involved buying a $700 necklace. His alter ego lampshades this, but Roger tells him to shut up.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode, in order to get into a local baseball stadium that he was banned from, Stan, rather than simply sneak or break in decides to: move to Cuba, become discovered by a baseball agent, get smuggled into the US, join a minor league team, get picked up by the New York Yankees, become addicted to steroids, get caught, get dropped by the Yankees and then get picked up by the team that plays in the stadium late in the draft.

Instead of changing gold into cheese, it changes gold into potato salad. So Two Brains invents a ray to turn potato salad into cheese. Then he and his henchmen steal gold, to turn into potato salad, to turn into cheese. Granted the plan <em>did</em> briefly work in his favor since Word Girl originally couldn't believe the cheese-loving doctor would steal gold when he would usually just steal cheese.
<div class="indent"><strong>Word Girl:</strong> Doesn't that seen a little unnecessarily difficult? I mean, why not steal potato salad instead of gold? Or use the gold to buy the potato salad?

Their whole plan is dependent on the gang's desire for affordable steaks and apparently they didn't bother to take in account that if the park workers use these counterfeit coupons they would get trouble with the police and get arrested and won't have the chance to meet them.

<ul><li> Study the planning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KatanasOfTheRisingSun">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>&mdash;especially at Midway, but any operational plan they put out. Marvel at the widely-spread, mutually-unsupportive forces they apparently tossed onto the map at random. Overthinking plagued the Japanese at nearly every level during the war. After it became plain that the Zero fighter plane was becoming outclassed, the Japanese realized they needed a replacement. Japanese scientists and engineers indulged in over 40 different prototypes, each as implausible as the last and taken immediately back to the drawing board as soon as a newfangled improvement occurred. In the interim, the aging Zeros and their pilots were cut to ribbons by Hellcats and Corsairs.
<ul><li> The military-industrial complex of <em>every</em> sufficiently large participant in the war had many instances of this trope up until considerably late in the war. Only those which happened to have better percentages of competent teams and officers and/or enough resources to afford countless costly mistakes managed to pull ahead.
</li><li> The celebrated admiral Isoroku Yamamoto in particular had a reputation for making plans that were elegant, yet still complex. Often, he pressured his superiors into accepting the plans by threatening to resign.
</li></ul></li><li> George Washington had a problem with this. He was at his best when he was forced to improvise and think on his feet, at his worst when he had time to come up with cumbersome, overly-elaborate battle plans. Made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics">a better tactical general than strategic general</a>.
</li><li> Tony Hawk mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBonesBrigadeAnAutobiography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBonesBrigadeAnAutobiography">The Bones Brigade An Autobiography</a></em> that he wanted to do as many tricky skateboard manoeuvres as he could, despite being criticised for it. The most prominent example being the evolution of his McTwist: First he did a McTwist, then moved on to one foot McTwist, then body varial McTwist, until it ended in an <em>ollie</em> McTwist, as in doing a McTwist with no hands grabbing the board!
</li><li> This is all too common among large corporations and institutions which have been using computers ever since the days of punch-cards, and which have often expanded to take in new and subsidiary companies which have brought their own legacy systems as part of the package. Instead of being sensible and rationalising things with a brand new system addressing the new needs of the company from the bottom up, it is common to see patch after patch applied and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubeGoldbergDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubeGoldbergDevice">makeshift remedies introduced</a>, in order to take fifty years worth of overlapping and often incompatible systems and make them work. One major British bank which is prone to regular collapses of its automated banking systems and its ATM network is notorious for this and its IT systems are a model of Byzantine complexity and Heath-Robinson makeshifts. Similarly, a major telecommunications company in Britain has internal IT systems which are fiendishly overcomplex to use, anything other than user-friendly, temperamental, and prone to frequent embarrasing crashes.
</li><li> In a very dark example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Zodiac Killer</a>'s reign of terror was marked by complex mathematical riddles, obscure clues to his identity mailed to the police, and endless hidden messages. His victims were selected by how they met mathematical patterns and geometric patterns drawn on the map instead of, for instance, personal bias or true hatred. The trail of death was the Zodiac's way of proving his mental superiority, so the complexity was more important to him than the murders themselves.
</li><li> In his autobiography, former Delta Force operator Eric Haney noted this to be something of an occupational hazard for special operations, particularly with regard to plans originating from outside the community. In one example, Haney was called to the Pentagon to be briefed on a plan for to swim ashore from a submarine, covertly infiltrate a Middle Eastern city... all to deliver replacement communications gear to the US embassy there. Haney instead opted to fly there openly as an official courier, with the comm gear in a diplomatic pouch.
</li><li> In his classic 1975 book, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, computer scientist Fred Brooks called this tendency in software design the "second-system effect," where programmers want to add extra features they wanted in the first version but didn't have the time for. This tends to cause slow, bloated, over-engineered software.
