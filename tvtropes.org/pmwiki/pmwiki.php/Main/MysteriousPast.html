<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em>, Kirika defines the trope nicely, although Mirielle has elements of her own past mysterious to her as well; although hers are more or less revealed in time, Kirika's past is basically left unexplained save for fragments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and the main protagonist of the series, there is little known about Light Yagami's life before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Death Note</a>. We don't even know what his personality was from a more complex perspective, his childhood, his general relationship with his peers, or at least what motivated him to be so self-centered beyond the praises he received on a daily basis. While Mikami has a backstory that largely explains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">why he's like this</a>, Light doesn't.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: Rei Ayanami is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>. She is introduced as a mysterious person whose past has been erased. Documents and data files are either redacted heavily or just not there. Many characters comment on this exact gap in information, in particular Ritsuko Akagi and Naoko Akagi. As such, her birth date or actual age in years is never revealed, and subsequent glimpses into the character's life only add to the mystery rather than explaining it. Moreover, NERV and especially her adoptive father Gendou Ikari go to great lengths to conceal Rei from the outside world (in particular, the SEELE organization which is becoming more and more curious about Rei).
</li><li> Vash, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, has this for most of the anime and around a third of the manga; all we know about him is that Rem found him in space.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kakegurui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kakegurui">Kakegurui</a></em>: The main character, Yumeko, is a walking question mark. Sayaka, the secretary of the Student Council President, reports that everything she found out about her was that she lives alone, her parents are dead (of causes never explained) and she has a sister who has been in a University Hospital for a long time (for reasons again unexplained). She also has loads of cash at her disposal, heavily implying that hundreds of millions of yen are nothing for her, and this is all the information people are able to find out about her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Re-Election arc reveals she is part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">The Clan</a> headed by the Student Council President Kirari, being a distant relative of the main branches, and even they have little information on her.</span>

<ul><li> A lot of people in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> have pasts that are not elaborated on. According to Dr. Kabapu Il Palazzo and he are the sole survivors of a lost civilization, but nothing has ever been explained in detail. Hyatt and Elgala might have had normal lives before joining ACROSS, but the only thing mentioned about their lives is that Hyatt joined ACROSS after seeing an ad in a newspaper, and Elgala worked at a hotel before joining ACROSS. The title character Excel might have been a completely different person before meeting Il Palazzo, based on her personality when she was amnesiac. And nothing has been revealed about Kabapu's secretary Ms. Momochi, even though she is always seen with Kabapu and interacts regularly with the rest of the cast.

</li><li> In the earlier days of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa</a></em> fandom, Fay's past was one of the things in the series most often speculated on by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction">Fan Fiction</a> writers. Everybody knew <em>something</em> bad had to have happened, for him to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">the way</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">he was</a>, but nobody knew what. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a> held out on it for about twenty volumes, and of course when it finally <em>did</em> come out it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">worse than</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">anyone had imagined.</a>
<ul><li> Played with in regards to the main character Syaoran, who at first appears to have nothing to hide, but as the series goes on, hints are dropped that not all is as it seems with his history (namely, he was apparently found on the streets, at a young age, by his foster father, and has no memory prior to that). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then the REAL Syaoran shows up and things get complicated. He becomes the main character, but we never find out what HIS story is until near the end of the manga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">and that just makes things confusing.</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> with the entire team. Jet is fairly straightforward but still doesn't reveal everything. Faye <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> at first doesn't remember her past at all, but then learns</span>. All we know about Ein is that he's a "data dog" (We never learn what that is), and Spike and Ed we are told frustratingly nothing about, even though we <em>meet Ed's father</em> and Spike's past is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of the show! With Spike, we're just given mostly vague allusions to his past in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriadsAndTheTongs">Red Dragon Syndicate</a>, with the only hard facts revealed being the identities of his mentor, his ex-girlfriend and his partner-turned-archenemy. Everything beyond that is just flashbacks without context (or dialogue).
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Asuna</span>, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>. Throughout the series clues and facts are dropped like breadcrumbs, each one redefining her as a character and the entire manga's story as a whole, but even now, with a very, very general outline, we're still mostly in the dark about it. Whatever it was, it was bad enough that she needed to erase <em>all memory of it</em> before she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">be normal</a>, and those memories are so dark that their unlocking created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a>... and left her comatose for a <em>week</em>.
</li><li> Agito of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, a Unison Device from Ancient Belka who had been smacked with a case of amnesia. What little she does remember has fueled a good amount of fan discussion, especially after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Sound Stage</a> that featured her story dropped not so subtle hints that Signum was her original master, implying that the Wolkenritter themselves are not just ordinary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">living programs</a> but have a Mysterious Past of heir own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Amatsuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Amatsuki">Amatsuki</a></em> utilises this in magnificent fashion as part of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JigsawPuzzlePlot">Jigsaw Puzzle Plot</a>, and the more that is actually revealed about past events, the more confusing things become. What happened to Toki's dead childhood mentor? What connection does Chitose have to them and to the science project that may/may not be responsible for time travel? What caused Lily's brain damage and the fire that killed her mother? What is Susutake's connection to the demons? Why did Sensai Midori disappear? Why did Kanzou split from Kuchiha? How does Bonten know the man with the IV drip? Who did Tsuyukusa kill and why was he separated from his tree? Who was Utsubushi originally? What made Yakou kidnap humans and trap them in the past? And what the hell has Kon got to do with all of this? Since when was he a hacker? Does he even have a family?
<ul><li> Interestingly, while the two characters from the modern world (Toki and Kon) have very mysterious pasts, most minor characters' backstories have been explained.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> and almost as many mysterious pasts, such as the strange gaps in Rukia's personal history (and possibly memory) during her time in the Rukongai. The most plot-triggering Mysterious Past is the origin of the mutually self-loathing friendship between Ryuuken Ishida and Isshin Kurosaki (the fathers of protagonists Ichigo Kurosaki and Uryuu Ishida) and their connection to Kisuke Urahara, which was implied early on to be directly connected to their relationships with their sons. The little known about them suggested parallel pasts, with both men having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">missing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">wives</a>. Even in the Final Arc, the truth about Isshin and Ryuuken and about their sons' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shared</span> family history is slow to unfold <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as it turns out to be the driving force behind the entire main storyline</span>. And there's <em>still</em> a major chunk of Ryuuken's backstory unaccounted-for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>: While none of the characters' backstories are ever elaborated on, Sebastian is the most mysterious character of them all. Little is known about him other than he is a demon, not even his true name or form (though certain aspects of the latter are shown, such as the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he wears high heels as a demon</span>). The anime gives a few tidbits: He met an Egyptian pharaoh, he spread a famous, major, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke">real life</a> plague more then 100 years prior to the events of the series, and he probably is of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a></span> variety of demon because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a crapload of feathers swirl around him like a twister</span> in his true form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>: The Noah family members. Absolutely nothing is known about a single one of them's backstory until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Skin Bolic dies and his awakening and job are revealed</span>.

We don't even know the name of his species. From the little supplemental materials we learn that Frieza and his family are mutants who are born ungodly strong among their race and are also unnaturally cruel. And that's about it. His relationship with the Saiyans isn't even clearly defined.
</li><li> The Saiyans themselves. Going just by the canon of the manga we know nothing about them outside they worked for Frieza, they plunder planets, there used to be good Saiyans among them who banded together to create a Super Saiyan God (which may or may not have happened before they worked for Frieza), and they got wiped out by their boss. Even using information from the anime opens more questions than answers. Like it's hinted that Planet Vegeta wasn't the Saiyans' original homeworld and that they actually came from another planet which may or may not been destroyed by the original Super Saiyan. <em>Super</em> clears some of this up, in that Planet Vegeta wasn't the Saiyans' original homeworld. They originally came from Planet Sadal, which was destroyed by infighting. Although it isn't explained how Saiyans can transform into gods, especially since no other species has shown to be able to do it. Which includes Golden Frieza, who had the power of a god without obtaining god energy.

It doesn't help that Chiaotzu gets the least amount of screen time of the original cast. Speaking of Tien, he also gets almost no background information outside of being the Crane Hermit's student and training to be an assassin. How he met the Crane Hermit or Chiaotzu is never explained.
</li><li> We have no clue what Yamcha or Puar did before they were desert bandits.
</li><li> Nothing is really known about Beerus and Champa except they're twins and the Gods of Destruction from Universes 7 and 6 respectively. It is heavily hinted by statements from Whis, Vados, and Zen'o that neither of them were born gods, but appointed to that position.
</li><li> What is Whis? He is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> stronger than Beerus, who is the God of Destruction,</span> and he appears to have god energy, but isn't a god.

<ul><li> Haruka Tenou/Sailor Uranus. In the first anime we get her origin story, but it still leaves out how she can possibly drive a car at 16 (in Japan the minimum age is 18). In the manga we know she's a famed racer and that she was <em>probably</em> Awakened by Michiru, and nothing else.
</li><li> Michiru Kaioh/Sailor Neptune. In both manga and anime we know exactly three things about her: she earned herself some fame as a violinist and painter, got her powers and knowledge of the past from dreams of her previous life (and this one comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the author</a>), and was responsible for Awakening Haruka... And the latter isn't actually certain in the manga.
</li><li> Setsuna Meioh/Sailor Pluto, at least in her modern day incarnation. She just appeared from nowhere, no explanation given on how someone specifically from the future can have a secret identity in the modern day. The manga explains that, after she died, Neo Queen Serenity made her reincarnate in the past as a reward for her services, but that makes one wonder <em>how</em>, given that the only Sailor Soldier with powers over time is Pluto herself.
</li></ul></li><li> Minako Aino/Sailor Venus appears to have nothing to hide, but had already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll">Seen It All</a> <em>before</em> becoming a Sailor Soldier (her reaction when Artemis appeared to her while she was in the shower was to treat him as a pervert and scream, and only later began wondering why there was a talking cat), could already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickChick">kick like a Savate practitioner</a>, and shows a great familiarity with airports. The anime episode specifically dedicated to her backstory only adds more mystery, as it shows her time as Sailor V in London...

<ul><li> Supplier of the Page Quote above, Rick Blaine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em>. For all that <em>is</em> revealed, we still don't know why (and exactly when) he left America or why he can't return.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Major Strasser:</strong> Richard Blaine, American. Age, 37. Cannot return to his country. The reason is a little vague.
</div><ul><li> Rick's past was such a mystery, even the <em>writers</em> didn't know. They spent a lot of time trying to come up with something appropriately cool; they failed. One finally suggested 'unpaid parking tickets.' That was the point when they gave up and left it "a little vague."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone">Sergio Leone</a> used this as a foundation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy">Dollars Trilogy</a>, and star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> also used it for the first Western he directed, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighPlainsDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighPlainsDrifter">High Plains Drifter</a>.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParisTexas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParisTexas">Paris, Texas</a></em> plays this completely straight: the main character, Travis, has a huge lapse of memory concerning his last four years, and whatever he remembers, he isn't willing to talk about. His memory gets better and some of his past is explained near the ending, but what he actually did for all those years to wind up nearly dehydrated and alone in a desert is still a mystery to everyone but him.
</li><li> Parodied with Chance the Gardener in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingThere">Being There</a></em>. In the novel, it's explained that he was the offspring of a mentally damaged woman who suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">Death by Childbirth</a>. It is strongly suggested that the wealthy "Old Man" who raised him and told him this is the father, a possibility also raised in the film adaptation though the mother's backstory is not brought up. In any case, Chance is not allowed to leave the house (in the book, he was told that he would wind up institutionalized if he did) and only does so when forced out by the Old Man's death. When the FBI and CIA investigate "Chauncey Gardiner", as the world accidentally comes to know him, no trace of him can be found (birth certificate, driver's license, etc. &mdash; all of which Chance likely never had anyway), leaving his past completely mysterious to all but a few.
</li><li> Ted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurnAfterReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BurnAfterReading">Burn After Reading</a></em> is shown to have once been a European Orthodox priest, before getting the job as the manager of... "Hardbodies". How does this happen and why? We may never know.
</li><li> This trope was gleefully subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grindhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grindhouse">Grindhouse</a></em> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetTerror">Planet Terror</a>.</em> Bad Ass El Wray's Mysterious Past is ultimately revealed, earning him the instant respect and trust of the formerly suspicious Sheriff.

<ul><li> Both great masters of the Force, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricMentor">Yoda</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sidious</a> are given little background on their origins. <em>Nothing</em> is revealed in the film continuity about Sidious's origins other than him being Palpatine: what little is commonly "known" is in fact only implied by the film and never confirmed. Indeed, it's believed that there was a ban on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> authors detailing either's backstory as a novel (one about Sidious's Master, Darth Plagueis, was cancelled for this reason). It was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a>, and revealed a lot of Sidious's backstory... but still left plenty that's ambiguous. Meanwhile, Yoda's past remains so mysterious that even his species remains unidentified, for reasons apparently known only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a>. Then, since Disney has de-canonized this, the old Palpatine backstory went too.

From their point of view, Vader just appeared out of nowhere shortly after the Empire's founding and starting doing the Emperor's bidding. Some aren't even sure that's he actually human, thinking that he might be an alien or some kind of droid.
</li><li> Snoke in the sequel films also has yet to be given an origin story of any kind or his species identified (as he doesn't seem human).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStuntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStuntMan">The Stunt Man</a>.</em> It isn't made clear why Cameron is running from the police in the first place.

They're a posse of deformed, monstrous killers who melt if they get wet. Absolutely no attempt is made to explain where they came from.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePostman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePostman">The Postman</a></em>: We never learn anything about Shakespeare's aside from his birth date at the end and how he was just a child when the war happened, even his real name. The memorial just says "The Postman".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jungle">Jungle</a></em>, Kurt drops a number of mysterious hints about his past and his reasons for being in Bolivia, including hints that he was a revolutionary. Given later revelations, it seems likely that at least some of this was made up in attempt to seem impressive and romantic, but, like most things regarding Kurt, his true past will remain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">Riddle for the Ages</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VioletAndDaisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VioletAndDaisy">Violet &amp; Daisy</a></em>: Neither Violet or Daisy's past is ever explained. Just how <em>did</em> two teenage girls get recruited and become assassins by a shady criminal organization? Also, where are their parents? We only learn that Violet is estranged from her dad, but nothing more.
</li><li> Not as vague as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">the games</a> tend to be, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonicTheHedgehog2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonicTheHedgehog2020">Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)</a></em> much of Sonic's history remains unexplained with very little time spent in his homeworld prior to coming to Earth. All that can be said is he's been pursued for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> since childhood, he was raised as an orphan by a talking owl named Longclaw, and he's been living around Green Hills for ten years since he came to Earth.

<div class="indent">The instructor was somebody named Whitlaw. Nobody knew much about him. It was his first semester here. We'd heard some rumors though - that he'd once punched a kid for mouthing off and broken his jaw. That he couldn't be fired.

He claims to be from a hive world, that his parents served in a Guard regiment before being killed in a battle against some kroot, and that his great-grandfather hunted bounties (and sometimes had bounties on his own head). However, Amberley, his sometimes lover and posthumous editor, has noted that there is absolutely no documentation substantiating any of that, that some of the events described are implausible when not impossible, and that Cain tended to edit his background story to appeal to his target audience on the rare occasions that he talked about it at all. The only part of that list of facts that is likely to be true is the bit about being a hive worlder, and even then, Amberley never figured out Cain's exact world of origin.

The elves are supposed to be incompetent both as warriors and mages but gradually develop competency as the story develops. However, it's very strongly hinted that Eilifer's been lying about his competence level from the beginning and is, in fact, both extremely powerful and extremely reluctant to use his power. Why, is never revealed leaving Eilifer an unsolved mystery even at the end of the story.

We know he was out of England for a decade and a half and various small stories about what he did there, but never the overall picture. Cardinal Wolsey helps by loudly chiding Cromwell for made-up transgressions (like impregnating an abbess) whenever anyone's in earshot, largely for entertainment and partly because mysterious pasts can be useful.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EddieLaCrosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EddieLaCrosse">Eddie LaCrosse</a></em> series, Angelina, the proprietor of the inn above which Eddie has his office (and therefore one of the few recurring characters), doesn't talk about her past &#151; enough so that Eddie's shorthand for "mind your own business" is to ask her an innocuous about her own background, reminding her that since he doesn't pry, nor should she. There are hints that something doesn't quite add up about her, but exactly what the deal is isn't explored until the fourth book.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiritThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiritThief">The Spirit Thief</a></em>, all three main characters have mysterious origins, and there's an unspoken agreement between them to never discuss this. As the books go on, though, their backstories are slowly revealed due to various blasts from the pasts coming back to haunt them.
</li><li> Most of the Wild Dogs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorDogs">Survivor Dogs</a></em> are mixes who were born in the wild, however there are several purebreds amongst them that suggest they were either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APetIntoTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APetIntoTheWild">originally pets</a> or their parents were.

How he amassed this wealth of soft power is never explained; various hints given could be taken to imply some sort of prior diplomatic career, but this is neither confirmed nor elaborated on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHanSoloTrilogy">The Han Solo Trilogy</a></em>: Han never finds out what happened for him to get dumped on the street, and doesn't remember anything past that (as his mind shuts off the fragments of memory which he has). Garris Shrike appears to know, and goads him using it, but is killed before he can reveal what really happened. Han's aunt also knows apparently, but is so distraught to see him he never learns anything of his past from her.
</li><li> Saif Dhu Hadin, the primary antagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMentalState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMentalState">The Mental State</a></em>, has gone to extreme lengths to maintain his anonymity and conceal his true identity. Nobody knows anything about who he was before being sent to prison. It is suspected that he might have been a member of a black-ops unit, but no one knows which one he belonged to if this is true.
</li><li> An interesting variation of this trope appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrashOfTheCountsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrashOfTheCountsFamily">Trash of the Count's Family</a></em>, where the protagonist's past before he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnateInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnateInAnotherWorld">reincarnated into another world</a> remains a complete mystery to the audience. No details about him, including his exact age, family or friends, his job, or anyhing else, are revealed until 270+ chapters into the story. Even then, a lot of things are still left unexplained. Choi Han's past is also mysterious to everyone except for the audience and Cale, notable because it's brought up by other characters.

</li><li> Adam. "Before Adam? Not a man among us can remember." One comic suggests that he was once a human member of the Initiative and Professor Walsh's favorite alongside Riley, and was used in the 314 Project after he was killed by a demon corpse possessed by the spirit of Mayor Wilkins.

By the time of the Seventh Doctor, much about his past had been explained, so the writers attempted to restore the mystery by implying that we hadn't been told the whole truth, and that he had a much darker past than had previously been suggested. Sadly, the series was cancelled before the so-called "Cartmel Masterplan" could be put into effect, but the revival has returned to the idea with its own take on it. In addition, much of what happened during the Time War (which happened in-between the original series and the new one) is mysterious.

One episode has us meet his friend from his time in training, who is excited to see his good friend again. Mephisto proceeds to use his face as a mask.

While some important facts about him are revealed over the course of the series, his past never gets any less mysterious. In fact, some of the revelations just add to the mystery.

Nothing else about where he came from is really known, though there are hints that he might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborg</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Divines</a> plucked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">from the future</a>, which would also help explain his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">madness</a>.
</li><li> The legendary Chimeri/Dunmeri hero Lord Indoril Nerevar. Very little is known of his early life and even then, there are conflicting sources. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Vivec</a> states that Nerevar was a mere merchant caravan guard before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">rising to become the leader of the Chimer people</a>. Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Ashlander</a> tradition holds that he was not born in the land that would eventually become Morrowind, though does not specify where he was born. Even the year of Nerevar's birth is unknown, though had to have been prior to 1E 369 when he first appears in the historical record.
</li><li> Rajhin, the legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiiti</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleThief">Impossible Thief</a>, is another. He is credited with, among other things, stealing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOfPower">Ring of Khajiiti</a> off the arm of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu">Daedric Prince Mephala</a>, stealing a <em>tattoo</em> off the neck of the sleeping Empress, and stealing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalTheft">the entire city of Falinesti</a></em>. Understandably, most tales of Rajhin have reached the point of legend, which obscure the facts of his life. The place of his birth is known (Black Kiergo, Senchal, Elsweyr), but not the year. He was apparently already deceased prior to the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">the Planemeld</a> in 2E 582, however, Empress Kintrya (from whom Rajhin stole a neck tattoo according to legend) began rule in 3E 48, hundreds of years later. With Khajiiti legend holding that Rajhin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">became a demigod</a>, and given other examples in the series of how achieving godhood can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">alter the universe's timeline</a> (Talos, the Tribunal, etc.), it could possibly explain some of the conflicting tales and timelines.
</li><li> Very little is known about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBadMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBadMother">Night Mother</a>, a mysterious figure who has appeared in several games in the series as the leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Dark Brotherhood</a>, and even much of that information conflicts with or is disputed by other sources. It is believed that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">once a mortal woman</a>, but when she lived and died, and even what race she was, is not definitely known.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixSiege">Rainbow Six Siege</a></em> have pieces of their biography redacted out. Vigil's takes it a step further and redacts his <em>birthplace</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07dlz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note07dlz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07dlz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though it's somewhere in North Korea, from the globe on his bio</span>. Furthermore, he's abandoned/forgotten his birth name and has very little memory of his childhood, beyond being on the run constantly and having to abandon his mother in a jungle.
</li><li> Marina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> is the only known octoling living amongst inklings. Octolings are still considered enemies to inklings, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">Marina</a> is especially jarring. It's unknown how she got above ground or how she met her music partner Pearl. There are some implications that she was a high-ranking part of the Octarian army. All we know thus far is that Marina heard the Squid Sisters during the final battle in the first game and she was inspired to become a musician.
</li><li> All Guardians from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">have no recollection of their past lives when they are resurrected by their Ghosts for the first time</a>, which is exacerbated by the fact that, in certain cases, centuries have gone by since their death. This is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>, as the Vanguard forbids Guardians from trying to learn about their pre-resurrection lives to prevent them from being distracted from their duty to defend the City. Ana Bray is an outcast in part because of her insistence on researching her past. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's <em>also</em> enforced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">the Traveler</a> itself, which seems to want Guardians to stay amnesiac <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays">for unknown reasons</a>; Eris Morn eventually admits that she's been slowly regaining memories of her pre-Guardian life ever since her Ghost was destroyed prior to the events of the series, suggesting that Ghosts latently suppress the memories of their Guardians.</span>
</li><li> Oddly enough for a protagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>'s past is almost completely unknown besides his birthplace (Christmas Island) and the fact that he and Dr. Eggman have been enemies since before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">first game</a>. Even as characters like Knuckles and Shadow have their backstories fleshed out, Sonic remains as enigmatic as ever. However, this is only really the case for the main series titles, as the various cartoons, comics, and film have gone into his history.

While at first it was believed that he was created by the Mushroom War, other theories suggest that he is an ancient being, or that his origin is related to GOLB. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even after the end of the series, his nature is never explained with certainty and why he wants the extinction of all life</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> King Sombra enslaved a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKingdom">Fisher Kingdom</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and hid its one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a> to him behind traps</span>, and... that's it. We never learn how he became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>-powerful, nor just why he wanted the kingdom&mdash;but it's implied he wanted to boost himself even more via its special magic before taking the rest of the world.
</li><li> Celestia and Luna's backstories have never been given in full, the depictions have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">various contradictions</a>, and the youngest we've seen them at has been adolescence. According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJournalOfTheTwoSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJournalOfTheTwoSisters">The Journal of the Two Sisters</a></em>, the two were raised as alicorns and were most likely born alicorns, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E1TheCrystallingPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E1TheCrystallingPart1">The Crystalling</a></em> contradicts this by implying they were <em>not</em> born alicorn. The book has also been contradicted elsewhere such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyLegendsOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyLegendsOfMagic">My Little Pony: Legends of Magic</a></em> showing they had Cutie Marks as teens (versus getting them as adults like in the book) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsForgottenFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsForgottenFriendship">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls &#150; Forgotten Friendship</a></em> stating Clover the Clever was male (as opposed to Captain Hurricane being the sole male of the Founders). As a result, the sisters' backstories are vaguely defined at best.
</li><li> Cozy Glow, one of the members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble">Big Bad Ensemble</a> of the last two seasons, is a sociopathic little pony (literally, she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Enfante Terrible</a>) who manipulates everybody in Twilight's Friendship School and seeks to destroy it from within (and later just plain tries to take over/destroy Equestria) for reasons that are never explained. She never gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a>, we never get any information regarding why. In fact, the only reason she was created, was to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">twist villain</a>. Needless to say, the lack of a backstory of clear cut motives did not do well with portions of the fandom.
</li></ul></li><li> Gadget from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> is an interesting case. She is <em>seen</em> as a character with a very mysterious past, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> authors having a large slew of differing ideas. However, the important parts of her backstory were stated within minutes of her first appearance: she's the daughter of an old pilot friend of Monty's, Geegaw Hackwrench, who had died a year before to the start of the series
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Galaxy Rangers</a></em>: Robert Mandell and crew explored three of the Rangers' pasts with "Ariel" and duologies "Phoenix / New Frontier" and "Supertroopers / Galaxy Stranger." The show was canned before exploring Doc's backstory, leaving only a few hints that, given Doc's fast-talk ability, may or may not be the whole truth...
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>. There have been several references to the fact that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">an outsider</a>, but exactly what he's doing in Miseryville, and how he ended up there, has not been revealed. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">the original concept</a>, the answer was he had specifically been sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> by accident, but even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> turned Hell into Miseryville in the final product, fans still commonly accept this as canon.
</li><li> The main antagonist in the animated series <em>"Belphegor"</em>. There are a few hints throughout the episodes that he may have lost someone dear to him and that, at first, he wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> with a secret identity. One episode implies Belphegor may have been a high rank military official and still remain one as a cover and to have access to secret weapons and technology. But who he is, how he became Belphegor and what happened in his past is never revealed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Bulkhead</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> served in the Great War as part of a team called the Wreckers, and he also has a bit of a history with the Decepticon Breakdown. Though tidbits are dropped here and there, we never get the full story.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>. After learning that Cosmo sunk the city of Atlantis <em>nine times</em>, Wanda asks where was she when this happened and he responded "I have a whole secret past that you know <em>nothing</em> about".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, the essential areas of the main characters' pasts are revealed through flashbacks. Except for the past of Uncle Iroh; all that is revealed about his past come in the form of vague statements by characters who know more than we do.
</li><li> The titular Wander from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> is very secretive about his past, with the few tidbits given over the course of the series establishing that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">far, far older than he appears</a>, and little else. This is occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, most notably "The Legend", where a group of children share their (horribly inaccurate) theories about a legendary hero (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyIAmHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyIAmHim">aka Wander, who's sitting right next to them</a>) to the shock and confusion of him and Sylvia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: The details of Rick Sanchez life before he moved back in with the Smiths is almost entirely unaccounted for; all we know is that he was at least still living with Beth and her mother around the time she was a young child. Other than that, both his life before getting married and the whatever he was doing while separated from his family is entirely unknown. Beth even alludes to his "incredibly vague backstory" at one point. It's mentioned in "The Wedding Squanchers" that Rick and others were involved in numerous atrocities fighting for freedom from the Galactic Federation, to the point of being labeled a terrorist. Exactly what these atrocities were are unknown though. Knowing Rick, probably best it remains that way.
</li><li> The Gems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a> </em> all have these due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">thousands of years old</a>. Even when we do learn about some of their involvements in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a>, there is still a lot about them that has yet to be revealed, such as who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl">Pearl originally belonged to</a> before she joined Rose's rebellion</span>, why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lapis was visiting Earth before getting trapped in the mirror if she wasn't fighting in the war</span>, and most importantly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rose's exact origins and what caused her to rebel and prevent Earth from being turned into a colony</span>. You'd think Steven would just ask them about their pasts, especially after they learned that they shouldn't keep so much information from him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">but instead they repeat the same mistakes of not telling him even when it would solve problems much faster</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">likely because if we found out sooner, there would be less of a plot</a>.
<ul><li> Gems in general have this. It is unknown how they first came into being (As they are artificially created), why they feel the need to reproduce despite being almost immortal, the origins of the Diamonds and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a> (And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Pink Diamond</a> was significantly smaller and less mature than Blue and Yellow</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> has Lila Rossi: suddenly appearing as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignExchangeStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignExchangeStudent">Foreign Exchange Student</a> at the end of season one, she started making up some wild claims to get attention. Some are very clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>, but the season 2 finale showed she was telling the truth about being the daughter of an Italian diplomat, and there's still no explanation for her apparent skills with parrying (something she had <em>not</em> mentioned, just reflexively caught a paper ball in the same way one normally performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchCatch">Punch Catch</a>) or why she seemed to recognize the picture of a past Chinese holder of the Fox Miraculous... That by some coincidence looks like an adult Lila.
