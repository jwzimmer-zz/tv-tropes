</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A Captain Obvious Reveal occurs when the writer sets up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">Reveal</a> for the story... only the audience figured it out already by the time they revealed it. Obviously, this will never apply to 100% of the audience, but when it applies to the majority of an audience, you have this trope on your hands.
</p><p>This can happen for a variety of reasons. The most common one is that the author put in so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> that the reveal becomes clear long before it was intended. (The right amount of foreshadowing, of course, is a delicate balancing act; if you have too little in an attempt to avoid this trope audiences might accuse you of having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> instead.) Another reason is that there were no other options for the reveal; if we're told that a character has a missing father, and there's only one character we already know who's the right age and position to have a missing child, audiences are likely to figure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">it</a> out. Another possibility is that the secret is shown in an episode that gets broadcast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder">before the one with the reveal</a>. And finally, it could be that no matter how well you plan your plot twists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">there will always be someone who can figure it out</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Note once again that this will never apply to 100% of the audience. Likewise, just because one audience member foresaw it doesn't mean we have this trope &#151; that particular audience member is just good at recognizing foreshadowing. Also worth noting that among the thousands who watch a movie/read a book, someone is bound to simply <em>guess</em> the plot twist ahead of time, no matter how well it is set up &#151; it's practically a statistical certainty. In addition, what separates this YMMV trope from the more general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">I Knew It!</a> is audience reaction. With I Knew It!, the audience is ecstatic (or at least satisfied) about having pieced together all the clues and having guessed the twist ahead of time. With a Captain Obvious Reveal, making the prediction took so little brain power that audience is just bored out of their minds waiting for the narrative to finally catch up.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist">The Un-Twist</a>; this trope is very similar, but not quite identical to that one. The Untwist can be intentional and <em>always</em> comes from too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> to the point the audience itself gets misdirected because they get suspicious of all the hints (which turn out to be <strong>not</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a>, but legit). Here, the obviousness is never intentional, and it doesn't necessarily need to have foreshadowing in the first place. The author genuinely thinks they have an actual twist in this case instead of a double subverted one.
</p><p>Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a>, where the twist was a surprise but has since become so well known to even those who never engaged with the work that it is no longer a twist. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise">Tomato Surprise</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>. The in-story version of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready">Everybody Knew Already</a>. A variation is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousJudas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousJudas">Obvious Judas</a> when the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> character is revealed to be the villain. Related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">Captain Obvious Aesop</a>, when a moral that most people in real life believe already ("Murder is bad!") is treated in-story as a profound revelation.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a> that leads to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalReveal">Internal Reveal</a>; characters may be surprised by information that is <em>new to them</em>, without any expectation that it will be a surprise to the audience.
</p><p><strong>Warning: Approach with caution. As this is a plot twist trope, spoilers will be unmarked...</strong> but considering what we&#146;re talking about, they&#146;re really obvious ones.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em>: The identity of Tem's killer is considered this, because in the lead up to the reveal, the investigation has clearly eliminated almost every other possible suspect. The killer is a carnivore male in the drama club, and in the fight with him, Legosi realizes he's extremely strong, that alone excludes most character since Legosi is noted to be a very strong fighter, and the manga actually blatantly spells this out this by having the killer, show that he's much stronger than the other bigger members of the club.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Double subverted with the mysterious masked man Tobi being Obito Uchiha. It seemed incredibly obvious right from the get-go until Tobi pulled a 180 degree on personality, authority, and power level that completely contradicted what Obito would have been capable (eg: the class dunce should not be capable of giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">the Fourth Hokage</a> a hard time). This actually led to a number of other characters being considered and causing quite a divide among the fandom. It isn't until 300 chapters later and a confirmation that he wasn't Madara Uchiha that it became somewhat possible, but the vast power level difference allowed this to be subverted up until the chapters leading into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> made it so blatantly obvious it was him that it <em>literally</em> could not have been anyone else.
</li><li> Then, of course, there's the fact that Naruto is the 4th Hokage's son...something most of the audience had already figured out since they look similar and the guy's face is carved into the side of a freaking mountain. Just one look at his picture and most of the audience had already figured who Naruto's father was. If you took out the whisker marks on Naruto's cheeks and grew his hair out a little, they could be <em>twins</em>. It really makes you wonder how ignorant the people of Konoha were to not see such an obvious resemblance. Interestingly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> is casually dropped during a conversation between Jiriaya and Tsunade.
</li><li> There's also the reveal that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Six Paths of Pain</a> are just dead bodies being controlled by Nagato. This wasn't revealed until quite a while after Pain (and later Nagato's) introduction into the story, but it was predicted by MANY people in the fandom.
</li><li> The reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Boruto's</a> teammate is Orochimaru's son hardly came as a surprise given that he both resembles Orochimaru and gave many readers the same creepy vibes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that Sasuke and Naruto were the reincarnations of the Sage of the Six Paths' elder and younger sons respectively. While many were still shocked, just as many were left unsurprised, and those that were shocked admitted it was obvious in hindsight, especially after it was revealed that their respective previous incarnations were Madara Uchiha and Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. Before the main characters encounter Father, we're led to believe that Father is Hohenheim since they both look alike, but we only see the bottom half of Father's face, so one would expect the series to "surprisingly" reveal that Father is Hohenheim. Then it turns out that he's a different person and they just look the same because Father is a homunculus who took on Hohenheim's appearance when they were younger. Arakawa did this on purpose.
</li><li> There's a minor reveal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em> that the Jovian Chulips are a kind of warp gate that allow Jovian robots to teleport in directly from Jupiter. Of course, since the audience has already seen the Chulips clearly opening some kind of portal, the biggest surprise is finding out that you weren't supposed to know that already.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>, in <em>Side:Despair</em> Episode 10, it's revealed that Juzo is in love with Munakata, not with Chisa. Most fans already knew that, but it felt good for it to be confirmed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> The siblings of Hoteye/Richard Buchanan and Yukino Agria (Wally and Angel/Sorano, respectively) weren't surprising to the majority of the fanbase who put two and two together. The former pair of brothers have similar appearances with polygonal bodies, while the latter pair of sisters have white hair and are Celestial Spirit Mages. Oddly enough, Lucy, who's fairly intelligent, heard Yukino's story about her sister and knows both Yukino and Sorano, doesn't seem to make the connection.
</li><li> It's gloriously subverted with Silver of Tartaros' connection to Gray; readers speculated from the start that he is actually Gray's father before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that while his <em>body</em> belongs to Gray's father, it's actually possessed by Deliora, the demon that killed Gray's parents and forced Ur to use Iced Shell... only to later be double subverted when Silver reveals he really <em>is</em> Gray's dad brought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> and lied about being Deliora just to rile Gray up enough to put an end to his agonizing existence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5GoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5GoGo">Yes! Pretty Cure 5 GO!GO!</a></em>, Kurumi Mimino aka <strong>Milky</strong> Rose being <strong>Milk</strong> is so obvious, yet only one character figured this out <em>for a while</em> before the reveal. The other characters actually realized some similarities, but they still didn't figure it out for four episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure">Hugtto! Pretty Cure</a></em>: Even if you haven't seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheMerchandise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheMerchandise">the leaks caused by the Pre-Heart toy</a>, it was pretty obvious that Ruru would eventually defect from the Dark Tomorrow Company the moment she decided to spy on Hana's family. If that wasn't blatant enough, then the focus on her and Emiru's growing friendship in episode 15 certainly solidify this fact.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Sabo being alive and a member of the Revolutionary Army. It is strongly implied with how he may have appeared to be shot, but his dead body was never shown, and later on, Dragon finds someone injured who he wants to be taken to the med bay on the Revolutionaries' ship. In the latter part of the flashback, Sabo grows to hate the nobles and by extension the government, so it makes sense that he would become a Revolutionary. Furthermore, the flashback was mostly about Luffy and Ace growing up together &mdash; if Sabo had just been killed off to never play any role in the story again, his character's existence would almost have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a>. In addition, one of the chapter covers showed an adult Sabo alongside Luffy and Ace, indicating that his role in the story wasn't finished yet. Subverted in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said Sabo was dead, and that cover was just a tease. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">That means the author outright lied to everyone</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>: Tuxedo Mask's secret identity and the reveal of Usagi's past life were not very surprising, as their alter egos were shown countless times in the series...and, in Usagi's case, the opening of the first series and the ending of the second.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Trunks is Bulma's son. While it was somewhat easier to be surprised by this in the anime (in the manga, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">Bulma had purple hair</a> instead of blue), his haircut resembles his grandfather's and he wore the Capsule Corp logo on his jacket.

The film expects this to be a big twist, but the fact that David's first introduced with shoulder-length hair, which he then cuts off so he's visually nearly indistinguishable from Walter, practically telegraphs that he's going to at least attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">Kill and Replace</a>; why else have the haircut?

Especially because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> is more or less standalone while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">first film in the series</a> had plenty of threads left hanging.

Further adding to this was the fact that Nolan willingly pushed production back several months because Cotillard was pregnant during the time they had originally planned to shoot and he wanted her in the film that much. Why would he do that for a random character, wouldn't that make more sense if she was a villain? She reveals in the climax that she is indeed Talia when she stabs Batman in revenge for leaving her dad to die.

However, the constant and ominous flashbacks shown in David's head every time just before he finds out that Charlie has been causing trouble again make it abundantly clear that at the very least, he's hiding something really big.

Everybody, even those unfamiliar with Tolkien's work, guessed it. Though to be fair the revelation of the Necromancer's identity was made clear in <em>The Fellowship Of The Ring</em> book, so hiding this fact in the adaption of the prequel would be almost impossible.

Most commentators instantly assumed that the whole thing was an act for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> film similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat">Borat</a></em>, which had recently made waves.

We see someone lying in a bathtub at the start of the film, and while the audience probably wouldn&#146;t recognise him because he was grown up, we then see all the other characters are alive and well. Then there&#146;s the scene where the fortune cookie messages spell &#147;Looks like Stanley couldn&#146;t cut it.&#148; After that the reveal over the phone isn&#146;t that surprising.

</li><li> Max Denbigh. He acts with a villainous attitude since his very first appearance, so everybody figured out that he would be working for Blofeld.

Problem is, nobody <em>else</em> sees Sophie with Arthur either, not even Sophie's young daughter, and also, why would Sophie be so cavalier about dating a lonely, mentally ill weirdo who lives with his mother and <em>stalked her</em> to work? Granted Arthur didn't mean any harm at that point, but still, there was no reason why Sophie would have been interested in a man like him in the first place, so the twist she barely knows who he is really isn't a shock.

There's quite a lot of foreshadowing for each of them, like Sgt.

Though note that this was on the strength of just a couple barely memorable mentions of him until the final book, making this more a case of the fans being just that obsessive. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21bym');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21bym" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21bym');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or the fans checked foreign language translations &mdash; the Black family was sometimes translated with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">meaningful surname</a>, leading to "RAB" being "RAZ" or other in some translations.</span>
</li><li> Snape is the Half-Blood Prince. The HBP is good at potions, and Snape got promoted to Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, which is usually a dead give away that you're going to be important in a <em>Harry Potter</em> book.
</li><li> Speaking of Snape, his love for Lily Evans-Potter certainly counts, as fans had already made a connection between the two characters long before they were even mentioned together and the ship actually was called the "S.S. Cliched" for a time.
</li><li> An example that can't just be blamed on fannish obsessiveness: The big reveal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em> is that Harry is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>, with a prophecy saying that he and Voldemort are destined to battle to the death.

All right, maybe it wasn't originally <em>quite</em> as much of a Captain Obvious Reveal as it is today, because Scott <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">invented</a></em> several of the tropes that became stock parts of the Robin Hood legend. Still, any reader with even the tiniest familiarity with the genre must have seen it coming a mile away.

According to the narration, Mal'akh killed Zachary Solomon before escaping prison with Solomon's money but it's not hard to figure out this is just careful wording. Dan Brown even drops a massive hint by outright mentioning Darth Vader and Luke and then having Mal'akh cut Peter's hand off but it's still treated as a big reveal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em> is rather infamous for these, due to its <em>very</em> obvious use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>. The most hated examples were that Valentine was Clary's father (<em>after</em> having revealed that he was married to Clary's mother) and Clary and Jace weren't siblings (for the meta-reason that they're the main couple and most fans aren't into incest).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> - Jon Snow's true parentage has not yet been revealed in the as yet unfinished book series, but the TV series (which has overtaken the books) revealed it as being pretty much the number one fan theory since the first book was written (although there are still diehard factions who insist on alternative possibilities, mostly on the grounds that the official TV reveal is "just too obvious, so it can't possibly be that"). The question of his actual legitimacy may be another matter, considering the somewhat shaky laws and precedents for divorce or annulment and remarriage in Westeros: but the question of his parentage can probably be regarded as settled - not least since, allegedly, the author only gave the go-ahead for making the show when the producers were able to give the correct answer to this exact question, and are unlikely to have changed what is evidently an important plot point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrailOfLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrailOfLightning">Trail of Lightning</a></em>, supernatural abilities come in pairs. One of Kai's is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, but he's reluctant to talk about the other one, and Maggie spends most of the book trying to figure out what it is. She also spends most of the book commenting on how good Kai is at persuading people into things, and at one point even suspects him of having sold her out to an enemy to save his own skin because it's too implausible that he could have just talked his way out of trouble. When it's finally revealed that Kai's other ability is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson">being able to make people do what he wants just by asking them</a>, this is played as a huge surprise but for some readers, the only surprise is being reminded that we weren't supposed to already know.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/UndefeatedBahamutChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/UndefeatedBahamutChronicle">Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle</a></em>: Coral being a girl in disguise is blatantly hinted right from her very first appearance, where she's described as androgynous in appearance and Lux inexplicably finds himself attracted to her. This may have been to distract from the more important reveal: that she's actually the second imperial princess Aeril. However, this also qualifies for the trope, what with Coral mentioning her elder and younger sisters (the imperial princesses being the only set of three sisters known to the reader).

Unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods">the book</a>, the show doesn't really make any attempt to actually hide his identity. His old friends call him Wodan (one of Odin's names), he is followed by two ravens who occasionally talk to him, and the New Gods even offer him to give him a bunch of sacrifices using Odin-class missiles. When he makes his reveal speech in the season finale of season 1, it's clear that the only one who is supposed to be surprised is Shadow.

Dylan agonises over whether this woman is legit, or she is performing some sort of scam to get his money, and after half a season with her, and Dylan finally deciding that she is legit, we find out that she was scamming him all along and everything she said to him was just a ruse to get access to his money.

By the time of the fourth season episode "Hang the DJ", the characters musing about how The System may be a simulation is likely to prompt eye rolls from long-time viewers. The romantic (as opposed to horrific) nature of the episode is almost unique to the series, but the other example is by far the most renowned in the series and has won several real-life awards.

This only worked when each episode had an individual title; once the show switched to a single title for the whole serial, said title would inevitably be "<em>(Something)</em> of the Daleks", giving the game away.

</li><li> Season 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Savitar being an evil version of Barry from the future. The foreshadowing was not very subtle ("I am the future, Flash" actually being "I am the Future Flash", the numerous other vague statements that pointed to this conclusion, Killer Frost instantly trusting him after learning his identity, etc.). It was so blatant that fans immediately dismissed it as <em>too</em> obvious and started theorizing about other possibilities (such as Eddie Thawne or Ronnie Raymond). Hence, they weren't happy to finally learn of his rather obvious identity <em>twenty episodes</em> into the season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">as many felt it wasn't worth the wait</a>.

About 3/4 of the way through the series, it's dramatically revealed that she is in fact a woman when her headgear comes off and her long hair is seen. The episode is called "Prince Igam, You're A Woman!" It's at this point that you realize it was in fact supposed to be a secret. On the other hand, the medium of Tokusatsu is inspired by traditional Japanese theater, in which some roles were played by the opposite gender (particularly in the art of Kabuki), so it's somewhat excusable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em> makes a big show of finally revealing Madam Gao's face, even though it being her was completely obvious to anyone who'd watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>, while being meaningless to anyone who hadn't.

His weird mannerisms are also a clear sign that something is off. In Episode 8, he asks the farmers some questions that are clearly about the Nisses even though he tries to hide it. In Episode 9, he's <em>very</em> interested in the Nisses' lost map. In Episode 10, he lies to the farmers and goes to steal The Big Book. Finally, in episode 12, he uses The Big Book to practice black magic, which the N&aring;s&aring;ere are known to do. Note that the reveal was probably obvious on purpose, as <em>The Julekalender</em> is partly satirical.
</li><li> Several tropes were so frequently repeated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> that fans were able to guess the moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard">Kamen Rider Wizard</a> premiered that the White Wizard was going to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">Evil Mentor</a>, be connected with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in some way and that Koyomi would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin">Living MacGuffin</a>.

They often point at your smell, one of them will refer to the village as a pack and they have uncommon ways of speaking (which at first could be seen as a dialect since they have a strange accent) and reasoning (like the way they give importance to the concept of someone "belonging" to a community). The village leader will task the player to slay some beasts that were harassing the village. She underlines a lot that they are different from villagers and that they look like them but they are not them: "wolf-like but not wolves and man-like but not men, I don't know how to call them, they are like us but not like us", they are "they are animals and live as wolves and carrion feeders" while the villagers "lived as humans as we could". A child says that "sometimes the beasties look like us but they change and get mean". Further investigation in the village will give another hint in the fact that apparently the hostilities between the two sides started with their ancestors shipwrecking on the island, implying that they had some ties in the past. Later you discover that the beasts are obviously lycanthropes (precisely wolfweres, wolves capable of turning humans) but their leader will reveal a plot twist: the villagers are too (although true werewolves). While the hints hidden in the village could lead the player to a final hypothesis that the whole island is inhabited by those creatures, it's evident from the first very dialogue with a child saying "you smell different" that the villagers are lycanthropes too.

Anyone with some knowledge of Batman lore can have a decent ballpark idea of who it is fairly early into the game; heck, tons of people correctly predicted who the Knight was the very first day he was unveiled, but discarded the idea because it was <em>too obvious</em>. Even if you didn't know anything about Batman, a certain character is seen several times through Batman's flashbacks who had not even been so much as mentioned in any previous game in the series. The last of these flashbacks has said character being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raped</a> by the Joker into having a grudge against Batman, then Joker supposedly shoots him dead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Guess who the Knight is</a>?

Most players won't take long to figure out they're one and the same, specially in the Game Boy Advance remake, where the Dark Knight's character portrait is just Leon's portrait <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFramedInShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFramedInShadow">with a darker coloration</a>.

So when Gabranth shows up near the end of the game and reveals he is Noah, the player is probably thinking "no kidding."

High Summoners, the title given to Summoners who have defeated Sin, are all dead; Yuna's meaningful glances at all places, before leaving them; the tearful farewell from her village or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChirpingCrickets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChirpingCrickets">noticeably awkward silence</a>, after Tidus insensitively saying that they'll do this and that, after Yuna has defeated Sin.

Aside from it being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a> territory, the hints are so unsubtle (Seymour asking why Auron's "still here" and saying that he can smell "the scent of the Farplane" on him) that <em>Tidus</em> knew what Auron wanted to say when he revealed his status as an Unsent to him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">The others</a> get this reveal in the final scene, where Yuna performs a Sending and Auron willingly lets himself be sent, after having fought a previous Sending that affected him.

This new villain has a personal beef with the Joestar family (they're the first ones he sends people to attack), villains from <em>Stardust Crusaders</em> like Enya and Vanilla Ice serve him without being brainwashed, and the way his minions refer to him makes it clear that he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">god complex</a> the size of Massachusetts. Yeah, it's Dio.

</li><li> The Crystal Exarch is G'raha Tia.

If the player had completed the Crystal Tower raid quest line, they're given the option of addressing him as G'raha the second they meet him in person, which he awkwardly answers with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <em>real</em> reveal is how he got to the First shard to begin with.</span>

<ul><li> Aiden and Sonja are from Fenith Island, but end up transported to what they take to be an alternate universe version of Fenith Island. They recall many dragons flying through the sky, but that's not the case here, though Odette mentions that this was the case 200 years ago. Many players already realized that the protagonists had been sent to a future version of their home. The actual revelation doesn't occur until close to the plot's climax.
</li><li> The three sisters Odette, Lily, and Violet are the Dragon Priestesses of Fire, Earth, and Water, respectively. There is no Dragon Priestess of Wind, as her lineage died out 200 years ago. This lack of the fourth priestess isn't treated as important to mention until she's needed and, yes, <em>Sonja</em> turns out to be the Dragon Priestess of Wind &mdash; and her lineage died out 200 years ago <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">because she and Aiden were transported forward in time</a>.
</li><li> When Aiden and Sonja get transported in the beginning, Sonja's body is missing and her consciousness has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharingABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharingABody">attached itself to Aiden</a>. Finding out what happened to Sonja's body is part of the plot, and they are confronted by a Masked Man. No prizes are won for guessing just whose face is hidden under that mask: Sonja's. And this doesn't get revealed until the very definite Final Boss battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>:

Even then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">many players were able to tell her gender just by looking at her</a>, and the twist has well and truly reached <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a> levels now.
</li><li> Adachi being the killer for some people. He was the only major character who didn't have a Social Link (until the <em>Golden</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>&mdash;and even then it was an Arcana that <em>doesn't exist in reality</em>), much like Ikutsuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>. Another hint was his tendency to "accidentally" give the Investigation Team hints, mostly to cover his own ass. Another give-away that it's a common cliche in murder mysteries that the killer is perceived as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> before the reveal while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goro Akechi being Black Mask, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor">the one who sold out the protagonist during the Niijima's Palace heist</a>. Many fans suspected this plot twist from the beginning, as Akechi isn't present in a lot of promotional material and didn't receive official artwork of his Phantom Thief outfit or his Persona Robin Hood until a few years after the game was released. The game isn't subtle in this regard either, as several of Akechi's DLC outfits gives him costumes that hint at his true moral standing such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIf">Ideo Hazama's uniform</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Catherine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Catherine">Boss (Dumuzid)'s suit</a>, a book for his Persona doesn't get unlocked when he joins the party unlike with the other party members <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note52n14');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note52n14" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note52n14');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this is downplayed as it's a case of the book being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> via programmer incompetence instead of being intended to hint at Akechi's true colors</span>, and one of the first scenes where the protagonist personally encounters Akechi has him talking about "delicious pancakes", despite that Morgana was the only one who mentioned pancakes and it's established early on that only those who have visited the Metaverse can understand Morgana. All of it actually serves to disguise the <em>real</em> twist about Akechi: his treachery was so obvious that the protagonists knew about it the whole time, having caught the "pancakes" slip-up.
</li><li> "Igor" is actually an impostor. His voice is completely different (while Igor's Japanese VA <em>had</em> died prior to the game's creation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a> doesn't even <em>bother</em> trying to sound like the original), he has different speech patterns and uses different terminology ("welcome to <em>my</em> Velvet Room" instead of "welcome to <em>the</em> Velvet Room", using different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapanesePronouns">Japanese Pronouns</a>, calling Social Links "Confidants"), he sits in a different way, and his previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt">Cryptkeeper</a>-esque demeanor is entirely gone. While the protagonists are fooled because they don't have the real Igor to compare him to, any player familiar with the previous games would sense something rotten from his first appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6">Mega Man 6</a></em>, the villain behind all of this games' Robot Masters is supposed to be a mysterious "Mr. X." Given how formulaic the series is, anyone who has played any of the previous five games knows Mr. X is very obviously going to be eventually revealed as Dr. Wily in disguise. Particularly since the series already tried a similarly unconvincing final boss fake-out with Dr. Cossack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em>, then again with Protoman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan5">Mega Man 5</a></em>, not to mention the fact that Mr. X looks exactly like Dr. Wily.

Then a later installment or expansion focuses on them, revealing that the Pok&eacute;mon that looks and acts very similarly to the main duo <em>is actually related to them</em>.

Are you telling me that the serious, pale-skinned man who uses a red scouter-like machine on his right eye, wears a robe with eyeballs in it and is constantly talking on behalf of Team Plasma is actually a villain and Team Plasma's real leader? And the guy who looks like a younger version of him is actually his son!? HOW WOULD I KNOW?" Though what IS a surprise is just how evil said villain is and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">how he has treated his son</a>.
</li><li> <em>Black</em> and <em>White</em> also try to pretend that N being the "official" leader of Team Plasma is a surprise until Nimbasa City. Even for players who skipped past the animation depicting his coronation that plays before the title screen every time the game is booted up, it wasn't hard to piece together that the weird kid who sympathized with Pok&eacute;mon was linked to that weird organization that claims to fight against Pok&eacute;mon abuse.

Nope, that's just silly. What, he's talking about the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a> in a positive light? Saying that the king had the right idea in cleansing the world of filth? <em>And</em> the grunts of the villain team even causally hang out in his caf&eacute;? When the reveal happens, most players are instead shocked that it's meant to be a reveal at all.
</li><li> In the same game, they make a similarly half-hearted attempt to hide the fact that Diantha is the Kalos League Champion. To the point that the anime doesn't even bother and introduces her as such in her first appearance there.

</li><li> Many people predicted Cosmog would evolve into Lunala simply by noticing how similar its design is. Same goes with Cosmoem and Solgaleo. This meant the only real surprise was Cosmog evolving into Cosmoem rather than them being separate evolutionary lines.
</li><li> The minute the Ultra Beasts were revealed for <em>Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</em>, people predicted they'd be Pok&eacute;mon you'd be able to catch later in the game, even though the developers were trying to make them out as being distinct from Pok&eacute;mon, and deliberately not showing any images of them in battle. By the time the datamining and official company statements revealed they were Pok&eacute;mon you could catch, the percentage of fans who believed they were only NPCs was practically nil.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Fire Emblem Gaiden</a></em> (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</a></em>):
<ul><li> In the remake, we have a red-haired masked figure who follows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Celica</a> and her party around, warning them of various dangers and seeming very concerned for Celica's welfare and seems to know she's actually the heir to Zofia, and Celica mentions more than once that she had a brother who died. It's decidedly a hugely unsurprising reveal when it turns out to be Conrad, Celica's big brother.
</li><li> Alm being Rigelian royalty becomes one in the remake. He has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthmarkOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthmarkOfDestiny">Birthmark of Destiny</a> just like Celica, multiple characters from Rigel appear to recognize him, he gets a unique weapon that's only usable by those of royal blood, Desaix practically spells it out in his death quote, and once the army reaches Rigel Alm feels a sense of familiarity with the place. Considering that <em>Echoes</em> is a remake of a game nearly two decades old, the developers probably assumed the twist was well and truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a> by now.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>:
<ul><li> Seteth and Flayn are actually Saint Cichol and Saint Cethleann. It isn't as obvious in Seteth's case, but Flayn is quite bad at keeping the secret, particularly when she takes exception to the way people talk about Cethleann. Both Seteth and Flayn have Major Crests of Cichol and Cethleann, whereas Ferdinand and Linhardt only have Minor Crests.
</li><li> A related but seperate reveal is that Seteth is actually Flayn's father, not her brother as he'd previously insisted. Despite Seteth claiming to look young for his age, he still looks like he could be at least a couple decades older than her (ignoring the fact that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>, which isn't learned until later) which fits a father-daughter pair better than a brother-sister pair.
</li></ul></li><li> Sirius being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight">Camus</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem">Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem</a></em> is practically the same as the above Conrad situation in <em>Shadows of Valentia</em>. Strangely though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> never actually happens. Though it's all but stated in his conversation with Nyna in the final chapter, there's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticUnmask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticUnmask">Dramatic Unmasking</a>, as he knows full well revealing his identity would cause more harm than good for everyone.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em>, we have Richard being possessed. If his sudden headache and subsequent bloody rampage against soldiers at Wallbridge isn't enough to clue the player in, there's also his desire to take revenge on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">uncle</a>, whom he also kills in front of the party. Richard's continued aggressive behavior, including starting <em>a war</em> is not enough to make the party actually figure this out themselves. While the player has figured it out ages ago, one must still sit through a good <em>20 hours of gameplay</em> before the idea of Richard being possessed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is even considered an option.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has an odd situation in that an actual reveal leads directly into an example. After Ozette is destroyed, the party meets a child claiming to be the sole survivor, whose name is Mithos. Over several skits, it becomes apparent that Mithos is more than he seems, and he shares many traits with the ancient hero Mithos. Then a genuine reveal occurs, as a storyteller informs you that the hero Mithos's last name was Yggdrasill, the name of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. However, several more scenes occur before the final reveal, which should be obvious from the previous two by the transitive property: the Mithos in their group is also Yggdrasill. The game tries to throw you off the trail by having the characters say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">Mithos is a common boy's name in Tethe'alla</a>.
</li><li> There's also the matter of Genis and Raine being half-elves. Fairly early in the game, a half-elven character compares himself to the two of them, but quickly and awkwardly retracts this comparison when Genis nervously declares them to be elves, and he realizes they've been traveling incognito. Combined with moments like Raine telling Genis "we're not like them" about a group of half-elven villains, the player may well have forgotten that their race was supposed to be a secret by the time the shocking-to-the-characters reveal arrives several plot twists later.
</li><li> Kratos is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Lloyd's father</a>. The age doesn't seem to make things work out, Kratos is stated to be 28 and Lloyd is 17 years old, so he would have had to become a father at a very young age, but the twist is still obvious. Early on, the party visits Lloyd's home and Kratos is seen standing at the grave nearby, which Lloyd reveals to be his mother's. They share similar facial expressions (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedFamilyQuirks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedFamilyQuirks">as well as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">a distaste for tomatoes</a>) and Kratos is a little <em>too</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">uncharacteristically emotional</a> when the party meets Kvar, who gloatingly reveals how he was at fault for Lloyd's mother's death. And when the party splits up into one fighting Kvar, Kratos refuses any combination that does not involve him on that team. The reveal itself? Takes place close to the last third of the game. The age thing is also made clearer when it's revealed that Kratos is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">about four millennia old</a>. And leaving most of these plot-related reasons aside, there is fairly interesting clue to be found in actual gameplay: one of the possible settings for your A.I. allies in battle is to let them fight, move and use their skills at their own discretion. To be specific, each party member actually has their own tendencies pre-programmed into their individual A.I.s. In Kratos' case, analyzing his actions in battle reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">he will almost always prioritize healing and protecting Lloyd over everyone else</a>, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">the all-important Collete</a> whom he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate">supposed to be guarding with his life!</a>

<ul><li> Elle is Ludger's daughter from the future. Within the first hour of the two meeting in the beginning of the game, multiple hints are dropped over and over and not leaving much of a potential surprise for the player. The revelation being given to Ludger and Elle themselves? The last third of the game.

Especially because the game states early on that the same thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheSelvesShallMeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTheSelvesShallMeet">cannot exist twice in the prime dimension</a>, making it obvious that the clock (and Elle) come from a fractured dimension.

<ul><li> For the second half of the game, the player is gradually given hints that Airy either isn't telling all the information, is evil, or both. Once you hit the 3/4 mark, the title screen changes the subtitle to read "Airy Lies", outright spelling out her deception. And yet, for another 20 hours or so of gameplay, the characters still can't piece it together. Even after when Ringabel remembers that she's evil and <em>outright murdered the others in another world</em>. When her true intentions are finally revealed, the cast is <em>shocked</em>, while the player is banging their head against the wall.

While the narrator's identity is never textually given in the entries, Alternis is very clearly shown in an illustration, make it easy to identify him as the narrator. From there, the various details, most glaring being Ringabel's lack of presence in the Book of D, make putting two and two together easy. There is a wrinkle, however, in that the player is initially led to believe that Ringabel is merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingAmnesia">faking his amnesia</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">covertly posing as an ally of the heroes</a>, especially after Alternis suffers an injury at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">Vict</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">oria</a> and the scene cuts to a recently absent Ringabel limping back to the party with the exact same wound.

It's an established fact that everyone in Lorule is the polar opposite of their Hyrulean counterpart. Zelda is kind, wise, and a genuine friend to Link, so it's not quite hard to guess that Hilda turns out to be a villain (though she's admittedly a complex character who falls more toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> territory than any truly evil acts). Even worse, the apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game, Yuga, is first seen transforming Seres, a young nun, into a painting for part of some kind of evil ritual. After completing the spell, Yuga <em>outright states</em> "Her Grace will be most pleased..." It's possible that the developers hoped players would overlook that line, but if you read it for even a moment, it becomes obvious that the two are conspirators.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo3">Diablo 3</a></em> has Act 2 that involves the player character hunting for Belial, the primal evil Lord of Lies. Everything points to the creepy child emperor of the desert nation he/she is in being the obvious culprit. Everything. This kid covers every evil child cliche known to man, short of speaking parseltongue (and that too, since his personal guards are snake people in disguise). Yet the players spend the entire linear story arc going off on increasingly silly red herrings only to be told by the creepy child himself that, surprise, he was Belial the whole time. No way! For that matter, it's so obvious that even the <em>player character</em> had figured it out a while ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballXenoverse2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonballXenoverse2">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a></em> opens with the conclusion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBardockTheFatherOfGoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBardockTheFatherOfGoku">Dragon Ball Z: Bardock &#150; The Father of Goku</a></em>, as the titular Bardock is enveloped in Freeza's death sphere, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">definitely is in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">no way</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">related to the</a> mysterious masked stranger with a similar damaged armor and voice that shows up with Towa, Mira, Turles, and Lord Slug immediately afterward.

This would be quite surprising... if the two agents didn't blatantly break the fourth wall saying the dead body is "pixellating" and could ask the pigeon brothers "Should I save my game?" (and be told "This game is hard-coded not to be unwinnable") within the first fifteen minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HuntDownTheFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HuntDownTheFreeman">Hunt Down the Freeman</a></em> renders its very name meaningless by the end of the game, as it's revealed that the person Mitchell is looking for, the culprit who killed Mitchel's squad and "fucked up (Mitchell's) face" is actually someone who was disguised as Gordon Freeman, rather than the man himself. The problem? "Gordon" is shown wearing an HEV helmet while attacking Mitchell, which is very uncharacteristic of the real Gordon, so any sharp-eyed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> fan who notices this detail will naturally suspect that something's fishy.

But it was already very obvious that the Black Monster was a Dragoon with a darkness theme and near the end of Disc 2, it was established that Rose has been around since the Dragon Campaign over 11,000 years ago (which itself was frequently hinted with the fact she knows far more about the time period than even acknowledged experts).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WeHappyFew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WeHappyFew">We Happy Few</a></em> first revealed itself with the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Wellington Wells</a> had turned itself into a drug-fueled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessIsMandatory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessIsMandatory">Happiness Is Mandatory</a> dystopia due to "The Very Bad Thing", which was somehow tied to the city's children being taken away after England was conquered by the Nazis during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2">World War 2</a>. Fans immediately began speculating what "The Very Bad Thing" was, mostly revolving around some kind of horrific counter-strike against the Nazis. Then the game came out and revealed "The Very Bad Thing" was actually the fact Wellington Wells let their children be taken in the first place. With the addendum that Wellington Wells found out after their children were taken that letting their kids be taken to preserve their own skins was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a>; the German army was so depleted that the tank units that blockaded them were entirely <em>paper-mache models</em>.

Three chapters into a nine-chapter game, it's possible to investigate the laboratory of Professor Tohjima (the de facto leader of the Dawn) and stumble across a secret monitor room. While the Professor turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a> into an art form, the other suspects' allegiances and motivations are made obvious, which makes the latter half of the game feel like a giant farce. The kicker? Even when it's finally obvious to the heroes that Tohjima is a traitor, the Professor <em>still</em> somehow manages to dance logical circles around them, and the reveal only comes when another senior member of the Dawn who was a former accomplice and both secretly and not-so-secretly guides the main character in the right direction tells him to knock it off.
<ul><li> <em>Mary Skelter 2</em> doesn't fare much better. The game includes an enhanced remake of the first game, but the fact that the developers heavily suggest playing the sequel first, going so far as to force the player to download free DLC to play out of order, makes it obvious that <em>Mary Skelter 2</em> leads into the remake narrative-wise.

A large man with a butt chin, pink mustache, and donning a bright green leotard with a Q on the front is selling cheap devices to fund his evil scheme under the name Steve McQwark. He then laughs maniacally after the last customer leaves as he says "Steve McQwark... <em>indeed!</em>" and ripping off the pink mustache, revealing him to be Captain Qwark, a large man with a butt chin known for wearing a bright green leotard with a Q on the front. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">What tops it off is that the camera crash-zooms on his face as if the director genuinely believes the audience will be shocked by this</a>.

Since the game is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover">Massive Multiplayer Crossover</a> of every Blizzard franchise, players can usually narrow every teaser down to a few options on the first hint, and figure out who it is exactly long before the reveal.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidenV">Raiden V</a></em>, the fact that Valbarossa is a woman is played up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">a surprise to the heroes</a>, however her feminine voice, which is not masked in any way, makes her gender clear well before she officially reveals the fact. This is mostly an issue in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Director's Cut</a></em> version if voices are enabled (which is the default) since the original version did not have any voice acting until an update introduced it.

</li><li> As soon as footage was shown for the fifth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a></em> game, <em>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</em>, was shown off, almost every fan called that the supposed Half-Genie Zombie, Fillin the Blank, was Rottytops. It doesn't help that WayForward didn't bother to try hiding it. Very few zombie girls even appear in the series prior to that point (let alone with green hair), Fillin isn't on the main art cover with the other half-genies, her stitches and ears are conspicuously hidden, and Shantae herself already deduced it when Harmony informed her of Fillin using a different alias (Ima Goodgirl).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades">Hades</a>:</em> The fact that Zagreus's mother is not Nyx, but Persephone. Just the mere premise of "you play as Hades's son" would make anyone even slightly familiar with Greek mythology go "oh, so Persephone is his mom, right?" Someone more familiar with said mythology would recognize that Zagreus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorlyMentionedMythsAndMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorlyMentionedMythsAndMonsters">an existing, albeit obscure god</a>, and while the specifics of his father and nature vary (he's often an aspect of Dionysus), he's almost always a son of Persephone. Not to mention Persephone being conspicuously absent from the underworld would make anyone curious as to what happened to her, and Zagreus having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MismatchedEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MismatchedEyes">Mismatched Eyes</a>, one of which is bright green, pretty much seals the deal. (It is revealed fairly early on, though, which may be why there wasn't much effort made to hide it.)
</li><li> Mandalore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em> is Canderous Ordo from the first game. Who'd have thought, in that they're both Mandalorians from the Clan Ordo, who are both getting on in years, both cyborgs, both travelled with Revan, and that they both share a voice actor. It wasn't supposed to be a big reveal. The game infamously got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed">Christmas Rushed</a> and there was intended to be a scene almost right after we meet Mandalore in which Kreia blackmails him into following the Exile, and refers to him by his given name. The final release of The Sith Lords however never actually refers to him as Canderous until close to the end of the game.

Justified in that the game was written in Japanese (and set in Japan), where Leon would be written completely differently, and since the characters are on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Last-Name Basis</a>, not many would know what his given name was<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note69qga');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note69qga" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note69qga');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Early on in the trial, when Aoi refers to Sakura by her given name, Leon gets confused and asks who she's talking about</span>.

</li><li> The Chapter 3 culprit being Celeste isn't very surprising either, since Celeste does a <em>terrible</em> job diverting suspicion away from herself, despite being purportedly a good liar. It's especially obvious once it is deduced that Hifumi is the accomplice when Celeste is the character who Hifumi interacts the most with; granted, she hates him, but his crush on her makes it easy for her to manipulate him. How intentional this actually is is up for debate.
</li><li> The reveal that Kyoko's talent is Ultimate Detective. She spends every single case ruthlessly investigating, everyone is amazed by how professional she is when inspecting bodies, she's constantly talking about proper investigative procedure, and the first thing she does after the Chapter 1 investigation begins is to search the crime scene, Makoto's bedroom, for stray strands of hair. Even Makoto himself, in the anime, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">says it was obvious in hindsight</a>.

It is a fairly big revelation earlier on that Hinata was part of the talentless Reserve Course, while Kamukura is stated in the book multiple times to be a former Reserve Course student. Combining this with the statement that the Reserve Course committed mass suicide and one can easily connect the dots. If you haven't read the book (like many people who played the localization) then the fact Kamukura exists at all isn't indicated until an exposition dump just before the final trial and several details about him aren't given (likely an effort to avoid this trope) making this a jarring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> instead.

Her repeated refusal to let anyone inside her Research Lab makes it very apparent that she's hiding something. Not to mention Kaito even states in Chapter 1 that Maki looks like she's killed before, an odd statement to make about somebody with a supposedly non-violent talent.
</li><li> Korekiyo Shinguji being the third culprit is one to a lot of fans. The katana used to kill Angie came from his lab (which, admittedly, anyone could have accessed). He was also the one to set-up the resurrection ritual (aka the death trap that ended up having Tenko killed). What makes this trope unique is how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUntwist">the culprit was meant to be obvious</a>.
</li><li> Case 5 is built on the premise of no one being able to ascertain if the victim is Kaito or Kokichi. Problem is, the game pushes repeatedly the idea that Kaito was the victim so hard, that anyone would instantly be able to guess that the game is pulling a fast one and that Kokichi was the real victim, especially since while Kaito's coat is conspicuously sticking out of the mechanic press, while Kokichi's uniform has been flushed down the toilet. Now, why would that be, unless they were trying to hide something?

She consistently appears right before or after the arc takes a dark turn storywise, continually makes <em>incredibly</em> unsettling and downright psychotic comments related to Oyashiro-sama and Hinamizawa's history, and her method of death in all arcs is her body being found burnt to a crisp, which as early as second arc is revealed to have happened before Watagahashi even happened, obviously signifying a fake body (by comparison, the other victim, Tomitake, was found with his throat torn out). The only way to not see the answer is that the game hints that Takano is possibly a kind of malevolent spirit, befitting the horror vibe of the first three arcs.

However, the large amounts of foreshadowing (for example, the use of the alias Harmony, as "Miwa" literally means "beautiful harmony"), along with the fact that several adaptions of the TMNT that use Karai explicitly state her to be the Shredder's <em>adoptive</em> daughter, made this blatantly obvious from the get-go.
