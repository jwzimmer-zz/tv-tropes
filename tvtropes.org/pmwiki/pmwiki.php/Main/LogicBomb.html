Good news. There's an easy solution: confuse it.
</p><p>If you give a computer nonsensical orders in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real world</a> it will, generally, do nothing (or possibly appear to freeze as it loops eternally trying to find a solution to the unsolvable problem presented to it). In fiction-land, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">it will explode</a>. It may start stammering, "I must... but I can't... But I must..." beforehand. The easiest way to confuse it is with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiarsParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiarsParadox">Liar's Paradox</a>, i.e. "this statement is a lie". A fictional computer will attempt to debate and solve the paradox until it melts down. If the computer is a robot, this will probably result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">Your Head A-Splode</a>.
</p><p>Paradoxes and contradictory statements (especially contradictory orders) have become the primary material used to build the Logic Bomb and thus the standard way to defeat any sophisticated, computerized system or AI. <em>Be warned</em>; if the Logic Bomb <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">fails to destroy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">the system outright</a> (and in some cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">even when it does</a>), the system's surviving remnants may go insane and attempt to kill you just the same.

Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">ridiculously dumb AIs</a> are also immune to logic bombs by virtue of not <em>understanding</em> the concept of paradox &#151; a sort of inverted case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">Achievements in Ignorance</a>.
</p><p>Occasionally the way to shut down such a computer is less like a few odd statements, and more like an advanced philosophical debate on the nature of truth, free will and purpose. The end result is still a super computer muttering an error several times before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation">exploding</a>.
</p><p>While this might have worked before the mid-1990s, every computer system since is capable of creating discrete "threads" to handle problems, which run in their own space while the critical parts of the system continue uninterrupted. It's what lets you keep using your operating system while internet pages are loading or music is playing. In actuality, when fed a paradoxical statement, a sufficiently well-programmed system would just notice the Logic Bomb has taken up too much time and kill its thread, like when your internet connection times out on you.

Of course these don't cause the machine to explode, but instead places the computing device <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindManipulation">entirely under your control</a>. They can also be bogged down or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BSoD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BSoD">BSoD</a>'d with programs such as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bombs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (each instance of the program opens two more). However, things like buffer or stack overflows are artifacts of our current underlying computer hardware architectures and it's quite plausible that such things won't exist in future computer systems. Overload attacks are probably always going to be realistic, though.
</p><p>If you want to do this to a well-organized group of people, use an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleOfDiscord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppleOfDiscord">Apple of Discord</a> instead.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a> might be the cause.

Kou is so nervous that when Gato berates him on the battlefield about not acting like a grunt by seeing the big picture (meant as an insult), Kou actually takes the comment as sincere advice and tells Gato "Y-yes sir.".

It tells him where various people "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">may or may not be</a>" leading him to know exactly where to find them.

It's a <em>picture</em> of a pipe. Actually, it's just paint on canvas that we recognize as a pipe. Well, usually it's ink on paper arranged to resemble the paint on a canvas that we recognize as a pipe. Unless you're looking at it now, in which case it's RGB pixels on a screen that look like the ink etc. etc. In fact, right now it's even worse. You are reading a set of pixels made to represent a series of squiggly lines that your brain interprets in such a way that you "see" the painting within your mind, which is comprised of nothing at all, and the image itself is created by mere electrical signals pulsing through organic matter that is made up of many cells, none of which have the individual ability to do this, which are all made from inorganic matter, namely atoms. And we don't even understand how the brain does pretty much any of this.

</li><li> In "The One Doctor", the Doctor needs to collect an all-powerful computer. The computer is willing to go with him, but unable to do so as long as he is the reigning champion on a quiz show. After the Doctor fails to best the computer by asking personal questions about himself, his companion blurts out "What <em>don't</em> you know?". Since the computer's knowledge is based on reflexively sending time-traveling probes out to collect information, every time it tries to answer, it learns the thing it was about to propose, and is forced to concede. The computer had previously cautioned the Doctor that asking "tricky questions" like "What is love?" wouldn't work.
</li><li> In the Fourth Doctor audio drama "The Eternal Battle", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Doctor meets a computer from a long-extinct race which hoped to demonstrate the futility of war by showcasing captured war-zones in time bubbles. With the Doctor's arrival, the computer decides that the experiment is a failure and makes ready to destroy the inhabitants of all the time bubbles. The Doctor argues that by doing so, the computer is waging war on war, and since war is futile, that means the computer itself is futile and must be stopped.</span> Fortunately, the system simply deactivates itself instead of exploding.

<ul><li> Mainstream operating systems are vulnerable to a simple one: the Fork Bomb. It consists on giving the computer an order that creates copies of itself, and the copies create copies, too, until the computer is too busy copying instructions and running them to do anything else. (If you're just learning how to use fork(), the probability of you doing this by accident approaches 1; many multi-user systems have per-user process limits in place for ordinary users so that an operator can still log in to kill your processes and then yell at you. If <em>you're</em> the operator... good luck; this is one of many reasons a common Unix aphorism is "You should never run anything as root that doesn't absolutely <em>have</em> to be run as root.")
<ul><li> There's a variant of Fork Bomb that just allocates a lot of memory. With enough privileges, the computer gets too busy swapping in and out the programs running to do anything else. If you're running a program that can allocate variables dynamically, failing to free up that variable creates memory leaks. Not a problem with modern OS's, but for embedded systems, you better watch yourself.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the concept of a "deadlock", a "chicken or the egg" paradox where two or more programs or events require the other to resolve in order to be able to resolve, themselves. Several computers have turned themselves into lifeless (until restarted) lumps of silicon, as a result of this.
</li><li> There is such a thing as "livelock", where a system can get stuck doing "work" without ever making progress. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> puts it, people weaving back and forth in a corridor, trying to let each other pass, is an example of livelock. Sometimes the solution is the same: stop, wait randomly, try again.
</li><li> In general, it's impossible to tell whether a program will loop forever or stop after some time. Most operating systems solve this problem by just not allocating all the processing power to a single program, but older ones do not, with the implied reasoning that the programmer will know what he's doing. This is called the halting problem. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_Problem">talks about it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> In summary, it's been proven that no computer (even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalComputer">Magical Computer</a>) can predict if any given program it runs will halt with perfect accuracy. Technically, the Halting problem proves that no <em>Turing Machine</em> (TM) can predict if any given program it runs will halt. TMs are like the computers you are using to read <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>, except that TMs have unbounded memory. Given that your computer has a finite amount of RAM, it's therefore not a TM, but rather, a fixed representation of one. (But the point still stands: Your computer can't solve the Halting Problem. Neither can a supercomputer.). It gets more fun in that if the program <em>will</em> halt, the TM will too... somewhen. If it <em>won't</em>, the TM may or may never tell you. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/loopsnoop.html">An elegant proof that the Halting Problem isn't solvable that can be enjoyed by non-mathematicians.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> There is the problem of proving the 'correctness' of a given program, something extremely difficult.
<ul><li> This is so difficult that at least one person gave up on it and went off to work on what we now call public key cryptography, because that problem (which some were certain was impossible) appeared more tractable.
</li><li> Donald Knuth's classic comment illustrated the futility of proving a program correct:
<div class="indent"> "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it."
</div></li></ul></li><li> The "classic" Mac Operating System
<ul><li> It dedicated an entire "DS" (fatal) error ID (ID=04) to catching and handling the so-called 'Zero Divide Error'; as the Mac Secrets books put it, "When programmers test their works in progress, they might deliberately instruct the computer to divide a number by zero, to see how well the program handles errors. They occasionally forget to take this instruction out, as you've just discovered."
</li><li> The list of classic Mac OS numbered error messages runs from -261 to 33; the <em>Dire Straits</em> errors (originally called the <em>Deep Shit</em> errors before someone in Apple got nervous) are all positive numbers, and if you get one, you are heavily advised to restart the system, since, even if it somehow managed to avoid a full crash, it's critically unstable. The DS errors run a wide range of reasons, from simple "something critical ran out of memory" (DS Errors 01, 02, 25, and 28) and "instruction not understood" (DS Errors 03, 12 and 13), to such doozies as "the Mac's processor switched into debug mode" (DS Error 08) and the aforementioned "Zero Divide Error".
</li></ul></li><li> Older calculators in certain operating systems were notorious for attempting to generate an infinite number of digits when asked to divide by zero, effectively crashing the computer. The most high-tech computer <em>still</em> does it. Ever wondered what Runtime Error 200 meant? It's the divide by zero error of Pascal programs.
</li><li> Kurt G&ouml;del is famous for managing to drop a logic bomb on all of mathematics by proving that no sufficiently complex, non-trivial, mathematical system can be both complete and consistent. The logic of it (haha) is argued as follows:
<ol><li> Someone introduces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">G&ouml;del</a> to a UTM, a machine that is supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalComputer">Universal Truth Machine</a>, capable of correctly answering any question at all.
</li><li> G&ouml;del asks for the program and the circuit design of the UTM. The program may be complicated, but it can only be finitely long. Call the program P(UTM) for Program of the Universal Truth Machine.
</li><li> Smiling a little, G&ouml;del writes out the following sentence: "The machine constructed on the basis of the program P(UTM) will never say that this sentence is true." Call this sentence G for G&ouml;del. Note that G is equivalent to: "UTM will never say G is true."
</li><li> Now G&ouml;del <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">laughs his high laugh</a> and asks UTM whether G is true or not.
</li><li> If UTM says G is true, then "UTM will never say G is true" is false. If "UTM will never say G is true" is false, then G is false (since G = "UTM will never say G is true"). So if UTM says G is true, then G is in fact false, and UTM has made a false statement. So UTM will never say that G is true, since UTM makes only true statements.
</li><li> We have established that UTM <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">will never say G is true.</a> So "UTM will never say G is true" is in fact a true statement. So G is true (since G = "UTM will never say G is true").
</li><li> "I know a truth that UTM can never utter," G&ouml;del says. "I know that G is true. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoInvincibleAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoInvincibleAfterAll">UTM is not truly universal."</a>
</li></ol><ul><li> The way this applies to math, not just computers, is basically that any sufficiently complex math system can be assigned a translation to/from a UTM - so when the UTM gets stuck on "G is true", the math system also gets stuck on the translation.
</li><li> Likewise, it can be applied to any system of philosophy and morality; "A machine built on Hegelian principles will never say this sentence is true".
</li><li> And this proves that people can't be perfect logicians, either, as every person has their own sentence G - "&lt;person's name&gt; will never say that this sentence is true". Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">worse</a>, "&lt;person's name&gt; will never <em>believe</em> that this sentence is true". Indeed, we already know such statements exist, because delusional people, by definition (that is, the word isn&#146;t just being used hyperbolically to refer to mere obstinacy) will never believe their delusion is false, <em>even after receiving evidence</em>. They&#146;ll just rationalize it away. So it could very well be possible that everyone is delusional and will never find out because we would reject that explanation instead of something that makes sense to us. Hence, philosophical skepticism.
</li><li> Note that in the same way the sentence G refers to the machine indirectly via its program, the sentence G also does not really contain the phrase "this sentence", instead using some more mathematical form of self-reference such as a quine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodelEscherBachAnEternalGoldenBraid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodelEscherBachAnEternalGoldenBraid">G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a></em> plays with this in "Contracrostipunctus." The Crab wants to own the perfect record player, but the Tortoise constantly devises records that use loud resonant frequencies that destroy the Crab's record players if reproduced 100% accurately. The Crab buys a reassembling record player that changes its structure to accommodate the record being played. This works at first but the Tortoise then makes a record that targets the module that effects the restructuring, that being the one component the record player cannot change. Eventually the Crab buys a record player that recognizes and simply refuses to play the Tortoise's records. (Sadly, according to Henkel's Theorem, the Tortoise will eventually figure out how to bypass that too.)
</li></ul></li><li> There was something called a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_poke">killer poke<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that actually does physically damage the computer.
<ul><li> A simple example would be overclocking the CPU so much that it overheats to the point where it melts. Now, if a CPU heats up too much it hangs before any physical damage is done, and a simple reboot fixes it. All the killer pokes mentioned on the Other Wiki were for old computers, and mainly depended on toggling a relay of one sort or another until it died. Modern computers don't have relays anymore.
</li><li> The original 'killer poke' was caused by a hardware change in some models of the venerable Commodore PET. The original hardware had text output sped up by setting a particular memory-mapped hardware register to a particular value, but later hardware versions would destroy the built-in monitor if the same change was made. The instruction in the built-in BASIC interpreter to put set memory values was 'poke', hence the name. Increasing the voltage still works, and memory and chipsets can often be easier to damage intentionally, although harder to do inadvertently.
</li><li> Literal hardware damage is actually possible when a FPGA (configurable logic circuit) is used for some calculations instead of a CPU. If the chip activates many concurrent outputs on a single bus, it may theoretically overheat or crash. If some infinite loop occurs, the entire circuit will start to oscillate at the maximum possible frequency, putting everything into indefinite state and consuming lots of power. Of course, FPGA compilers try to protect against such situations.
</li><li> A related concept is the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire">Halt and Catch Fire<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (HCF) instruction. Originally, this was a jump-to-self instruction (used as a HALT) in the IBM System 360 Mainframe (which used magnetic core memory, typical of systems of the era). Because of how core memory works, this resulted in the same access wires (core memory cannot be built with printed circuits) being used very frequently and overheating, eventually smoking. Some microprocessors (such as the Motorola 6800) have undocumented opcodes that cause the processor to do strange and generally non-useful things which are sometimes referred to as HCF instructions outside the design team. The programmer's manual for the MIPS-X processor refers to a Halt and Spontaneously Combust (HSC) instruction in the variant built for the NSA, but this is merely a joke. Some versions of the Zilog Z80 processor are rumored to have had an undocumented opcode that could actually burn out the processor.
</li></ul></li><li> In designing digital logic circuits, an example of a logic bomb would involve connecting the outputs of two logic gates. As long as your gates agree on an answer, everything is fine, but if they disagree, you end up with a short circuit which will almost certainly cause the circuit to die a horrible flaming death due to the loss of the black smoke (i.e. this could be used to make a literal logic bomb). Good designs will never actually have this problem because they never connect two logic outputs without additional protection circuitry. Most logic chips have some protection built in. It's not good for them, but they will usually survive. The big problem is that the result becomes undefined as the two chips 'fight' each other. It also wastes a lot of power due and can cause overheating.
</li><li> An arcane example known as <em>fatal thrashing</em> occurred on the IBM System/370 series mainframe computer, in which a particular instruction could consist of an execute instruction, which crossed a memory page boundary, which in turn pointed to a move instruction, that itself also crossed a memory page boundary, targeting a move of data from a source that crosses a third memory page boundary, to a target of data that again crossed a memory page boundary. The total number of pages thus being used by this particular instruction is eight, and all eight pages must be present in memory at the same time. If the operating system allocates less than eight pages of actual memory in this example, when it attempts to swap out some part of the instruction or data to bring in the remainder, the instruction will again page fault, and it will thrash on every attempt to restart the failing instruction. The minimal hardware configuration of the System/370 didn't have 8 pages of memory available for user mode programs, making this a major problem on these systems.
</li><li> The Year 2000 Problem
<ul><li> Computer systems that represented years with only two digits (while assuming the first two digits were 19) would be unable to distinguish the year 2000 from the year 1900, thus throwing off date/time calculations. Fortunately, since computer people saw this coming well before it hit, most of the truly important systems were redone with better date representations well before any problems manifested. Wikipedia's page can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Computer systems software that use "Unix time"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kq48');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1kq48" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kq48');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">i.e. use time handling routines based on those that originated in the C programming language during the time Unix was developed &mdash; and the legacy of the C programming language is <em>widespread</em></span> such as (obviously) the Unix variants and Linux, but also many subsystems running on, say, Microsoft Windows, have a similar problem. Unix time typically uses a signed<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2uk12');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2uk12" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2uk12');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">meaning capable of having both negative and positive values</span> 32-bit counter based on the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. However, this is doomed to roll over (i.e. go from most positive to most negative) sometime in 2038, creating a "Y2.038K" problem for Unix-based systems.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3kxyr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3kxyr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3kxyr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">one suggested fix which is already implemented on some systems is to redefine the counter to 64-bit, which postpones the problem for about 293 billion years</span> <br><br>Exactly what Y2.038K might lead to is difficult to predict, since applications handle negative time values differently. Some applications will deal with the most negative value as a date-time in the past (specifically on 13 December, 1901) and may keep working (and producing garbage) until someone notices. Other applications are programmed to reject any negative time values<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4l88s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4l88s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4l88s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or even values less than at some defined point in time such as when the application was developed</span> and will raise some kind of error, which in turn may have all kinds of effects from alerting the operators while preserving data to crashing the system. Needless to say, having the system treat the value as invalid (which is arguably easier with Unix time-based systems that it was with Y2K-susceptible systems) is preferable to tolerating it: silent wrong answers are much worse than crashes (talk to any medical equipment, process control, or financial computer vendor).
</li><li> To prove that the Y2K problem was not just hype, there was an example of a real data output error. For technical reasons, one state required that a certain class of commercial vehicle have title documents created several months before it was actually built. The result was that the title documents were created in the summer of 1999 for vehicles to be built in early 2000. This state also had a special designation for any vehicle built before an arbitrary year early in the 1900's. Because the computers had not yet been brought up to Y2K compliance, they actually did think the year for the vehicle manufacture was 1900, and duly put the special designation on the title documents.
</li><li> While many people were concerned about banks and other financial institutions having problems with Y2K, this was unlikely for a simple reason: Such institutions would have become aware of the problem in 1970 or 1975, when programs generating documents for 25- or 30-year financial instruments started giving garbage answers for 2000. Since most banks take a long view of things (or at least have divisions that do so), such problems would have been dealt with far in advance.
</li></ul></li><li> The race condition can be seen as a logic bomb ranging from something minor to something very drastic. It involves one piece of data that two components can either read or write to. A minor case of a race condition is your display. Say the graphics card starts to render frames at a rate faster than what the display can put out. While the display is reading the frame buffer, the graphics card suddenly copies a new frame into the buffer. The result is the display for one frame of its time showing two images at once (this phenomenon is also known as tearing). A more serious instance when this occurred were two incidents involving <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac-25,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> a radiation therapy machine.
</li><li> Denial of Service attacks are a kind of logic bomb that is very hard to defend against. Basically, it keeps something vital on the computer busy such that it can't service legitimate requests. To put it in a real life analogy, imagine working at a coffee shop and suddenly 1000 people show up. You either have to service them all even if 999 people don't want anything, or you service no one and tick off the one legitimate customer.
</li><li> In naive set theory, the set of sets that contain themselves is ill-defined.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5y8v7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5y8v7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5y8v7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The set may contain itself or not; one can never say which.</span> Likewise, the set of sets that don't contain themselves can't exist.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6xhho');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6xhho" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6xhho');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The set violates its definition whether it contains itself or not.</span> Various axioms of set theory avoid these problems. When directory structures were created, they emulated naive set theory. In particular, Unix and DOS/Windows directories normally contain themselves (the "." subdirectory). One can imagine creating a directory without the "." subdirectory. So how do the filesystems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> the paradox? <br><br>In naive set theory, the phrase "the set of X satisfying condition Y" defines the set and declares it to exist. One can define a directory, but one still has to create it. One could create a directory of all directories of a filesystem (using links, for example) that contain themselves. Does it contain itself? That's purely the creator's choice; with or without itself, the directory will be the directory of all directories that contain themselves. What about the directory of directories that don't contain themselves? That directory will never be created.

</li><li> Then there was the theory that the existence of the Babel fish, a symbiotic creature that lives in your ear and translates any language for your brain disproved the existence of God. The argument was that the existence of an organism so unlikely yet so useful is evidence for a creator and that therefore this removes the need for belief and without belief god is nothing. Ergo there is no god. The man responsible for this argument went on to prove that black is white and white is black and got himself killed at a zebra crossing.

Jon Stewart debates Republican supercomputer Reagan OS 911 (a parody of IBM's Watson computer featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>).

Then that means that Obama is a US citizen. But Obama was not born in the US. So either Obama was not born in the US and fetuses are not human beings, or Obama was conceived and is therefore a US citizen and the rightful President.

During this, The Ship, who is extremely obsequious towards the villain, scans the Doctor and confirms him dead. When the Doctor gets up and starts walking around and talking to it, the Ship is extremely confused, since it can't understand why he is talking if he is dead, and suggests rescanning him. At this point, the Doctor takes advantage of the situation by convincing it that the Ship does not need to rescan him, as her master is infallible, and she is therefore infallible. Therefore, her reading was right, the Doctor is dead, and as he is dead he cannot order her to do anything that would cause any harm to her or to her master, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">so she should start obeying his commands</a>.

However, Harm&#146;s partner Meg is en route in a helicopter: the on the spot solution advocated by Harm is for the helicopter to fly low and at low speeds, thus simulating a ship, which the computer won&#146;t target. This has an actual basis in reality; to prevent them picking up things like birds or stationary terrain features (and cars on them) most air-search radars have a speed check built in, and won't display contacts moving slower than about 70 mph and below a certain altitude. This was exploited in the First Gulf War to break the Iraqi air-defense system.

Alpha-6 figures out that the curse can be broken if they say something that's the truth but that's a catch-22, it seems... Until one of them realizes that by saying "I can't tell the truth" he's both lying and being truthful at the same time. Once all the Rangers figure this out, the curse is broken, and they're quickly able to bring the villain down.

<ul><li> The Carly Simon song, "You're So Vain" is a logic bomb just waiting to happen. "You're so vain/You probably think this song is about you..." But it <em>is</em> about him! Augh! My head... Here the bomb is in the implications. It is IMPLIED his vanity would lead him to assume the song is about him, but if it actually is about him he isn't necessarily vain to think so. But since the song is about someone vain enough to assume the song is about them based on vanity alone, it cannot be based off him, making his assumption the song is about him one of vanity, as he would be vain enough to think everything is about him. It would be a twist on the 'this is a lie' statement using personality characteristics. The only way to defuse the logic bomb is to assume that Carly Simon was not, in fact, singing about anybody. Or that she wasn't thinking about the vain person, but about how much contempt <em>she, herself</em> feels towards them. Of course, nothing in the song says that the person in question is <em>incorrect</em> for thinking the song is about him &mdash; just excessively <em>presumptuous</em>.

When the head of the Dimir goes crazy tries to conquer the plane he's arrested by a Boros officer and taken to be accountable for his crimes.

Opalescence turns all other enchantments into creatures which retain the effect of the enchantment, and Humility is an enchantment that turns all creatures into 1/1 and removes their special abilities. Opalescence turns Humility into a creature, which means Humility is now removing its own passive ability to remove the passive abilities of things. Oh, did you notice that Opalescence doesn't turn itself into a creature, and cast another one to fix that oversight? Well, now it gets <em>really</em> complicated. The ruling for how just these two cards interact is among the most complicated in the game, and begins with the disconcertingly specific statement, "This is the <strong>current</strong> interaction between Humility and Opalescence".

One example is the card Pole Position, which makes the monster on the field with the highest attack be unaffected by spell cards, which can cause an infinite loop if you use a spell card to increase a monster's attack to be the highest. To prevent this from being abused as a way to force a draw, the rules have been patched so that it is against the rules to voluntarily take an action that would result in this kind of infinite loop. If the action would be completely unavoidable, like drawing a card, then Pole Position simply destroys itself.

</li><li> In the poster, the third thing to scream is "Does a set of all sets contain itself?". If taken directly, a set that contains all sets does contain itself. A good metaphor is a box that contains 3 apples and another box. It is irrelevant what is in the box, the box contains three apples and a box. This metaphor has its limits since numbers don't take up any physical space. The way this would create a problem with a computer is if you asked the computer to show everything in the set including members of the sets because it will cause an infinite loop. Further, the set of all sets would also include the set of all sets that do not contain themselves, which therefore includes Russel's Paradox.

Eventually, they destroy themselves when Numbuh Four mentions that <em>they</em> are threats to children, which they concede makes sense, invoking this Trope.

Unfortunately, Perfect Man actually seemed to be a much better crime fighter than Captain Caveman, so the older hero considered retiring. Unfortunately, once Perfect Man got rid of all the crime in Bedrock, he took things too far and started running the place, changing the rules the way <em>he</em> thought they should be, figuring that's the way they should be because, well, he was perfect. Captain Caveman couldn't defeat him with brawn, but did so by proving he was <em>not</em> perfect: he told the guy that if he was perfect, everyone would like him, and it was clear now that everyone hated his guts.

<ul><li> Optical illusions that appear alternately as one thing, then another, such as the vase/faces image, work by setting off a minor Logic Bomb in the brain's visual association area. The visual cortex takes in data from a (temporal) series pairs of 2-dimensional retinal images and tries to construct from them a plausible interpretation of activity in the 3-dimensional world (sort of). When certain stimuli are ambiguous between two mutually exclusive interpretations it cannot represent the world as being both so (for some reason - possibly adaptation or perhaps simply as a result of neuronal fatigue) it alternates between them.
</li><li> The first flight of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5 Rocket<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> failed due to a bad conversion of data, a 64-bit floating point number to a 16-bit integer. Since the guidance system basically crashed, the rocket self-destructed. (Or you could say the guidance system crashed, and so too did the rocket).
<ul><li> The guidance system crashed, and told the rocket to make a sharp left hand turn, something that rockets in real life don't generally do... at all.

<ul><li> Singularities in general tell us that the physical model that contains them has a hole at that point where it cannot predict events. This is important in two ways: It is a very good idea to know where the model you are using to predict the behavior of the real world is going to be wrong or useless, and the presence of a true singularity in the model shows that the model, no matter how good it might be, is incomplete or wrong in some way.
</li></ul></li><li> An F-15 was landing in the Dead Sea (below sea level). During final approach, the navigational system crashed. The pilot landed manually. Since this was very close to hostile countries (within the Middle East), the contractor needed to fix the problem quickly. It turns out the navigational system divided by the altitude. When the altitude went to 0, it caused a divide by 0 crash in the navigational system.
<ul><li> This is why edge cases in programming are important.
</li></ul></li><li> Simlilarily, a divide by zero error led to <a class="urllink" href="http://gcn.com/articles/1998/07/13/software-glitches-leave-navy-smart-ship-dead-in-the-water.aspx">a critical failure of the propulsion system<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> aboard the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS <em>Yorktown</em>, requiring it to be towed back to port.
</li><li> Arguably, infinite looping commands such as "add 2+2 until it equals 5" (which will never happen, hence the infinite loop), which result in a computer freezing as it attempts to solve the loop, are technically logic bombs. Modern computers don't do this is because they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">actual</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">loop-absorbing crumple zones</a>, triggered automatically when the system detects such a stalled process, and either letting the user terminating the process or ending it automatically.
<ul><li> In the greater world of networks, it is possible to have two automated systems go into a similar loop. One early such instance was the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_loop">E-mail loop<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: when an e-mail is sent to an auto-reply address with a return address of <em>another</em> auto-reply address: causing the two systems to play e-mail tag replying to each other. This loop was quickly discovered and various preventive measures taken to minimize the impact.
</li><li> Some advanced mathematics programs (like Wolfram Alpha) will compute almost anything you ask. While they return an error on division by zero problems, you can ask them to compute pi to any suitably large number of places and the program will brick until it gives you exactly what you ask for.
</li></ul></li><li> The fork bomb is another logic bomb used to attack computers. It is a simple program that does nothing but request that the computer make two copies of it and run them. Exponential growth means that within moments there are millions of copies running and the computer grinds to a halt attempting to deal with them despite the fact that individually they don't do anything. Modern operating systems usually put a stop to this by only allow a limited number of processes to run at once.

<ul><li> Other antiviruses on the list includes McAfee, MalwareBytes, Sophos, and even good quality ones like AVG and Avast!.
</li><li> Zone Alarm likes to point out that it just marks its own Installer/Uninstaller as Adware. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">That's not virus. Just honesty.</a>

One will intercept a data transfer to check it for potential threats, then send it on. The other will see this transfer, intercept it, and send it on. The other will see <em>this</em> transfer, intercept it, and send it on. The other will see <strong>this</strong> transfer, intercept it... This is why some Antiviruses try to detect if it's the sole antivirus on the system, and bitch about it if it isn't. Due to a misconception spread by some "computer experts" back in the 90s, there were a handful of users who were convinced that it's beneficial to have multiple antiviruses on the same machine. After all, two heads are better than one (except, in this case).
</li><li> A problem can occur when running a modern anti-virus on an outdated system or vice versa that can make an anti-virus program detect viruses that have <em>already been quarantined.</em> They then create a second quarantine file of the "new" virus so that the next time it checks it finds <em>two</em> problems. Then 4, then 8, 16, 32, and so on until the constantly running security checks and copious junk data hurt your PC's performance way more than the original malware did. Fortunately, it'd take forever to get bad enough to brick your PC, so it's pretty easy to catch and repair.

They do not form paradoxes, however, since tropes are not logical truths. Firstly, tropes generally hold for one or more works (here, "works" is meant in the widest sense possible, including memes and general attitudes: the first pair above are about memes) and it is understood that they do not necessarily hold anywhere else (which is why we have example lists): the trope XIsY is shorthand for "it can be non-trivially observed that in some works, X is Y". Next, even when looking into those works where the trope appears, it may reflect anything from fictional "fact" (X is indeed Y) to tendency, possibly in a twist (X tends to be Y, but <em>whoops</em>) to belief (X is held to be Y, at least by one character). Sometimes we make an example of a work because it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averts</a></em> X is Y, and that's still not paradoxical. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> sections of tropes, or in the case of a trope that deals with the real world (as the last pair in the list above does) contradictions could suggest a possible paradox, but most such can be explained by (acceptable) vagueness and bias.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage">Don't Shoot the Message</a> is a good example of a Logic Bomb that surfaces often in everyday life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrites</a> are said to be bad because they do not live up to the ideals they preach - but they are more often condemned by their ideological opponents than by decent people on their side who you'd think would urge the hypocrites to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical">Stop Being Stereotypical</a>. Ideological opponents, of course, criticize a given movement because they think it's inherently bad. But if you don't actually believe in an ideology you say you believe in, and that ideology is bad, then logically you must be good. But it's unethical to live a lie, so you must be bad - even if what you're lying about is something that's bad in the first place, in which case undermining it is good, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>. Humorously summed up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImportanceOfBeingEarnest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImportanceOfBeingEarnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>, when he has the character of Cecily say: "I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy."
</li><li> During the late cold war there was a recurring issue with group based ICBM missile silos somehow ignoring their own safety protocols and attempting to launch by themselves. In one declassified instance the computer went so far as to ignore commands to abort the launch. In a move of desperation, one of the silo crew members set the missile to target its own silo. The computer tried to target itself but ran into the problem of orbit, meaning that any ballistic long enough for the missile to hit its launch point would also be powerful enough that (at least in the computers mind) the warhead would never hit the ground. The launch computers crashed and fed no data into the missile's flight computer, which then also crashed causing analogue systems to abort the launch.
</li><li> The Ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea proposed <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_paradox">several famous logical paradoxes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which completely baffled his contemporaries. They describe seemingly simple scenarios in ways that resulted in obvious contradictions. Some of these were resolved by his contemporaries but the paradoxes of motion are still debated to this day. This was a very serious problem because Zeno's premises seemed undeniable and his arguments had proper logical form yet the results were clearly false. To many this suggested that logic itself was broken.
<ul><li> On the other hand, there is a school of thought which holds that Zeno never meant for the paradoxes to be taken as serious philosophical questions, but rather to illustrate a flaw in the Logical Method - i.e. that exercises in pure Logic do not always translate over into Reality - which they quite handily did.
</li><li> A few refutations to the paradox of motion do exist:
<ul><li> Aristotle's was quite simple. Zeno assumes that time and distance are infinitely divisible but there is no evidence for such a claim. Without this assumption the entire paradox collapses. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor">An unjustified claim that results in absurdity can be safely ignored.</a>
</li><li> Modern calculus attacks the problem from a different position arguing that that Zeno's logic really is flawed as no rigorous method for handling infinite sums existed at the time. If time and space are infinitely divisible then ordinary arithmetic is not appropriate to understand or describe them. Indeed the paradoxes of motion pose questions that are basic examples for introductory calculus.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Many mathematical proofs, from the irrationality of the square roots of 2 to Fermat's Last Theorem, rely on this- assuming the opposite of the theorem to be proved, and then arrive at a contradiction through mathematical induction.
</li><li> In the early days of chess playing (or otherwise engaged in evaluating strategic choices) computers, the computer often crashed when there were multiple choices of which none offered an advantage over another&mdash;so that it couldn't choose one.
<ul><li> Which itself is an adaptation of the classic paradox of a donkey being placed equidistant to two equally sized, equally nutritious bags of feed - unable to choose between the two, the dictates of pure logic would lead it to starve to death exactly where it was.
</li></ul></li><li> The famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The47Ronin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The47Ronin">The 47 Ronin</a>" situation was a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> by the standards of the Shogunate. The ronin had violated a direct order from the Shogun by avenging their master Asano through killing Kira, the one who forced him into commiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">seppuku</a>... yet some said they had acted according to Bushido by avenging their master. Some believed the truly honorable thing would have been to just charge Kira's home ASAP, deciding to get gallantly cut to pieces through honest action rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">attain vengeance through trickery</a>, especially given the major flaw in their plan - the potential for Kira to die of natural causes at some point before their attack - which would have left them unable to avenge Asano.. On the other hand, in a society where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">honour was most definitely more important than life itself</a>, it could be argued that their actions were the ultimate demonstration of loyalty to their lord: by publicly dishonouring themselves to ensure their plan's success, they could be seen to be making the supreme sacrifice for Asano's sake. As such, the deal was resolved by allowing 46 of the ronin to commit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">seppuku</a> instead of being dishonorably executed; the youngest of them was spared and became a monk.
</li><li> A number of logic bombs have been found lurking in the realms of pure mathematics and logic with various consequences.
<ul><li> G&ouml;del's First Incompleteness Theorem (explained in the "Computing" section above) demonstrates that any useful mathematical system must contain statements that can never be shown true or false. These are perfect logic bombs as a person or computer could try forever to answer them without success or even finding evidence that they will never succeed. The only way to demonstrate that a statement is a "G&ouml;del statement" is to evaluate the entire mathematical system it is part of.
</li><li> Bertrand Russell managed to fatally undermine set theory, the foundation all of mathematics and logic, with the paradox "Does the set of all sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?". To resolve this rules had to be added to set theory so that paradoxical sets could not be defined. There are now various versions of set theory each of which produces slightly different versions of mathematics and logic.
</li><li> Before either of these Karl Weierstrass went looking for logic bombs in calculus because he was sure it was poorly defined. Eventually he found a function that is continuous but has no derivatives, a curve that is infinitely jagged, which contradicted a basic assumption about the field. He managed to patch that hole but set off a great deal of concern about how well mathematics was justified.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox">The Liar's Paradox<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: "This statement is false." Which could be accepted as true....but then that confirms it's false.....but then it's true...then it's false. The logic constantly loops, making the statement neither true nor untrue.
</li><li> The similar "Epimenides Paradox". Epimenides, a Cretan, (apocryphally) stated that "All Cretans are liars". If this was true, then it would seemingly conflict with Epimenides' statement, but if it was a lie then it would seemingly confirm the statement, just contradicting it by being truth coming from a liar. Taken at face value it appears to be the same as the Liar's Paradox, but in actuality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">if Epimenides is lying about all Cretans being liars</a>, then it's entirely possible for a Cretan (who needn't be Epimenides) to tell the truth.
</li><li> A Swedish activist claimed that he wished to move to a country where no immigration was permitted. Just chew a little on that one...
</li><li> Asking some forms of mechanical calculator to divide by zero doesn't break them, rather it causes them to loop infinitely (as the computer expects to perform the given task an infinite number of times). The machines parts will whirr around quite happily until you tell it to stop. You can see this in action <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFJUYFlSYsM">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">Hey, it's a great way to re-lubricate the machine.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan">koans</a> deliberately use this as a way towards enlightenment by momentarily shorting out rational thought when the listener tries to understand it.
</li><li> Relatedly, Buddhism and Zen especially have a concept known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)">Mu<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which boils down to "the question itself is wrong".
<ul><li> The physicist Wolfgang Pauli would later express a similar sentiments describing one paper as "Not even wrong." and telling Lev Landau (a great physicist in his own right) that "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."
</li></ul></li><li> Lal Bihari Mritak tried to do this to the legal system of his native India by kidnapping his cousin, picking fights with and insulting officials, and trying everything he could to get arrested. The reason he did this was that his uncle had bribed an official to get Lal Bihari declared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegallyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegallyDead">Legally Dead</a> (Mritak means "dead" in Hindi) to seize his land, and if the local officials arrested Lal Bihari, then they'd effectively admit he was still alive.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn">Gabriel's Horn<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a mathematical object that has a finite volume but an <em>infinite</em> surface area.
</li><li> Some high school advanced mathematics textbooks contain problems where you are first presented with a formula which seems to prove 1=0 or something equally contradictory, and then asked to spot the flaw in the proof. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The most frequent case is that there's a step where division by zero occurs, expressed as something not obvious like "x - y" where somewhere else in the proof it is established that x = y.</span>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number">Imaginary (or complex) numbers.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Using "real" numbers, the square root of -1 should not exist, because multiplying any number by iself produces a positive number (1 X 1 and -1 X -1 both equal 1). At some point, someone decided to call this nonexistent number "i" and just move on from there. Though it seemingly makes no logical sense, and there's still no good way to explain what "i" actually means, it's now used extensively in science, engineering, and the like.
</li><li> Malicious compliance (see "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">Bothering by the Book</a>") is a direct invokation of this. The boss expects things to be done a certain way, and an employee performs it that way, causing harm to the company. The boss can't punish the worker for doing as they were specifically ordered to, but Bad Things(tm) happened because of the worker's actions. This usually results in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>.
</li><li> A nonsensical command in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction">Interactive Fiction</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2">AI Dungeon 2</a></em> will result in the AI going into an infinite loop of prompts, forcing the player to revert to an earlier state or restart the game.
</li><li> Imagine inexperience. Come on, do it.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh_Association_of_Dead_People">Uttar Pradesh Association of Dead People<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> founded by Lal Bihari is a group of people who were legally declared dead as part of various schemes to cheat them out of inheritances or wrongfully inherit their property. A common tactic by members is to deliberately get arrested&mdash;which puts the authorities in a bizarre fix, as they now have to explain why they arrested what is officially a corpse.
</li><li> During an exchange on CNN between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for the 2020 presidential primaries, they asked if Sanders ever told Warren that a woman couldn't win the election, and he said no. Then they asked Warren <em>what she thought when Sanders told her a woman couldn't win the election.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat">What?</a>
