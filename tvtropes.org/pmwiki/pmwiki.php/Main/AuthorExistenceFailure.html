</p><p>If readers are lucky, the author had enough warning or foresight to keep notes on their plans for the rest of the series or at least fill someone else in on the most relevant plot points, so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCollaboration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCollaboration">their work can be continued by another author</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivedItsCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivedItsCreator">possibly even several</a>.

Worse would be if the series just isn't popular enough to justify going through the effort to find a new author, leaving fans to wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a>.
</p><p>This can also happen with individuals who play a major role in creating a group work; for instance, actors or directors. In any case, it gets to be pretty sad that so many people lose their jobs because of one person's death, but if the work was good enough it's likely that those who worked on it won't have too much trouble finding another job.

</p><p>Please note that this trope applies when a creator (writer, director, etc.) ceases work on a project, not a participant (actor, well... mostly actors) unless they had significant input.
</p><p>Also note that since all creators are mortal, this is not merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PeopleSitOnChairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PeopleSitOnChairs">when creators die</a>, it's when they die with works still in progress.
</p><p>This might result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">The Character Died with Him</a>, where the show goes on without the character a dead actor portrayed, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">Fake Shemp</a>, where there is an attempt to disguise the absent actor.
</p><p>Not to be confused with the criticism trope known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a>".

<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> died, he left his life's work <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Phoenix">Phoenix</a></em> unfinished, which he had great plans for. Had he stayed alive to finish it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory">the separate stories of each time period in each volume would eventually converge at a central point</a>, the "present", and tying all the loose ends of the Phoenix's story together.
</li><li> Happened the same with the other great mangaka legend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShotaroIshinomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShotaroIshinomori">Shotaro Ishinomori</a>, who left his most famous manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em> unfinished, taking a long hiatus and promising to create an end for it exactly in the year 2000... But he died early in 1998. Fortunately, in 2012, Shogakukan announced the story would reach a proper conclusion based on Ishinomori's original concept notes, sketches, and a novel draft. It was illustrated by Masato Hayase and Sugar Sato and written by Ishinomori's eldest son Jo. Unfortunately, the finished product resulted in a <em>huge</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> over liberties that Ishinomori's son had taken with his father's storyline.
</li><li> Noboru Yamaguchi spent the rest of his life working to avert this trope by attempting to finish <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> as fast as possible while also undergoing treatment for cancer. Though he sadly passed away on April 4, 2013 (which was a cruel twist of fate due to the fact he was about to conclude the novel series), he ended up succeeding from beyond the grave when it was announced in June 2015 that the series will finally see its completion after all, ending a years-long limbo.
</li><li> Ken Ishikawa, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter Robo</a></em>. Though he did leave some notes behind, they were apparently only for Getter Robo Hien - a prequel. The cliffhanger ending of <em>Getter Robo &#256;&#7717;</em>, the latest series chronologically, has yet to be resolved.
</li><li> The director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">The 08th MS Team</a></em>, Takeyuki Kanda, died while the OVA was still being produced. One effect of that was that it took over three years to finish it, making it the longest-running single <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> production until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Gundam Unicorn</a></em>, except the long-running period for that has been planned from the start.
</li><li> And a decade and a half later, Umanosuke Iida, aka the guy who took over for Kanda... died while working on another series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TowaNoQuon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TowaNoQuon">Towa no Quon</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em>'s author Sunao Yoshida died in 2004 and the story was finished some while later by other writers. The manga managed to stay long until April 2018 with 21 volumes. Yoshida was also the original story creator for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeppuKairikuBushiRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeppuKairikuBushiRoad">Neppu Kairiku Bushi Road</a></em>, which didn't get picked up until 2013, a whole decade after it was first announced.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaoruTada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaoruTada">Kaoru Tada</a>'s manga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItazuraNaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItazuraNaKiss">Itazura Na Kiss</a></em> was left incomplete when she passed away after a tragic accident. Luckily, she had the ending semi-planned out, and it was used for the anime.
</li><li> Perhaps not a total Existence Failure, but what happened to mangaka Kyoko Okazaki certainly comes close: in 1996, she was hit by a drunk driver before completing the last few chapters of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>-esque cosmetic surgery drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HelterSkelter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HelterSkelter">Helter Skelter</a></em>. The resulting accident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">left her quadriplegic and mute</a>. The manga was finished in 2004, by her former assistant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SugarSugarRune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SugarSugarRune">Moyoco Anno</a> (yup, the wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno">Hideaki Anno</a>), working from Okazaki's storyboards and with her consultation, albeit on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>. Poor Mrs. Okazaki's rehabilitation continues to this day.
</li><li> Takahiro Yamato of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KazeNoStigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KazeNoStigma">Kaze no Stigma</a></em> died in 2009 before his work was finished.
</li><li> Yoshito Usui of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em>. Tragically killed in a hiking accident in September 2009. The anime (which mostly uses original stories not found in the manga anyway) was put on hiatus for a few weeks after his death, but it was later announced it would continue. It is confirmed Usui&#146;s longtime team of assistant manga artists will carry on the manga.
<ul><li> With the exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiFujiwara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiFujiwara">Keiji Fujiwara</a>, who retired from his role as Hiroshi Nohara nearly four years before he lost his battle with cancer, several voice actors from the anime died during the show's run.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KanetoShiozawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KanetoShiozawa">Kaneto Shiozawa</a>, the voice of Buriburizaemon, died of injuries sustained in a fall over the Golden Week holiday in 2000. This lead to the character being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">unvoiced</a> for 16 years, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroshiKamiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroshiKamiya">Hiroshi Kamiya</a> was brought in as his voice actor.
</li><li> Ginzo Matsuo, who voiced Ginnosuke Nohara, died in 2001. After his passing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuichiNagashima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuichiNagashima">Yuichi Nagashima</a> took over.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SayuriYamauchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SayuriYamauchi">Sayuri Yamauchi</a>, who voiced Nanako, died in 2012. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShizukaIto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShizukaIto">Shizuka Ito</a> took on the role the following year.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RokuroNaya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RokuroNaya">Rokuro Naya</a>, who voiced Enchou-sensei, died in 2014, Junpei Morita took over a year later after the former's passing.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Keiko Tobe, the mangaka of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WithTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WithTheLight">With the Light</a></em>, died of an unspecified illness in late January 2010, leaving the manga unfinished.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiKon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiKon">Satoshi Kon</a> suddenly died while making a film called <em>The Dream Machine</em>, which he described as aimed at a younger audience but accessible for his older fans, with a cast made entirely of robots. Kon learned that he had a late-stage pancreatic cancer in April 2010, but initially didn't tell anyone because he didn't want to disturb them &mdash; cancers are still something of a taboo in Japan. He later regretted this decision and verbosely apologized to everyone in his farewell note (he ended it with an apology for "leaving while everyone else was still working") after his producer Masao Maruyama promised to him to finish the movie. Sadly, the film is now stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MM">MM!</a></em>'s author Akinari Matsuo passed away without warning on April 18, 2011. The phrasing of the letter, which does not mention accident nor illness, suggests suicide.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YasuoYamada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YasuoYamada">Yasuo Yamada</a>, most recognizable as the voice of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>, died of a brain hemorrhage in 1995, a month before the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FarewellToNostradamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FarewellToNostradamus">Farewell to Nostradamus</a></em>, the movie that would mark the series' return to the big screen in ten years.

But unlike the <em>Shin-chan</em> and <em>Sazae-san</em> examples, Momoko had little involvement in the anime after 1996 (which was when the original manga ended), only returning to the show to write three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Milestone Celebration</a> episodes. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09uze');"><sup> *&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note09uze" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09uze');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> These were "The Day I Was Born", the show's 1,000th episode that aired in 2012, and "Maruko Sings A Song In The Bath" and "I Love Tama-Chan", the episodes that aired on the day of the show's 25th anniversary in 2015.</span>

Specifically, he has the series explicitly listed in his will, requiring that the story be released to readers in some form. His editors are also heavily rumoured to know every detail that is coming for the series and have access to materials for completing it in the event that Oda can't continue it.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> Example, this is actually a major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators">Re:CREATORS</a></em>, where two of the main characters (Meteora and Altair) fall under this trope. Their Creators died before they could meet them, with Altair <em>herself</em> coming into existence due to her Creator's despair and passion upon creating her before she committed suicide, being the very citing incident to spark off the show's events.
</li><li> Narrowly subverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a></em>; the reason the original manga series had such a quick and dirty ending is because Yukito Kishiro became <em>very</em> ill while writing it, causing him to fear the story would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">Left Hanging</a> if he didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">give it some kind of ending while he still could</a>. Luckily, his health improved and he promptly started a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> to release all the stuff he couldn't squeeze into the original.

As a result, Cure Bloom was the only <em>Splash Star</em> character to have a speaking role in the film, and Lulun was the only pre-<em>Go! Princess</em> fairy from the franchise to speak. This event, along with the fact that there were now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">way too many Cures to give speaking and screen roles to</a>, led to the <em>All Stars</em> films from then on featuring only the current team and the two teams before it. The later film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure">Hugtto!

Unlike Herg&eacute;, however, he had left plenty of notes and a complete outline of the story, which made it possible for another artist, Bob de Moor, to complete the story... 13 years later. That's a cliffhanger for you. Because he suspected he wouldn't finish "Three Formulae", Jacobs left the copyright of the series relatively open so it would eventually have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">an ending</a>, (leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Olrik</a> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>).

The rain was added by Uderzo to mark the point in the work where Goscinny left off when he died.
</li><li> Mike Wierningo died working on an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> featuring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, having only drawn seven pages. It was finished by a group of different artists doing a couple of pages each and published a year later, with the proceeds going to charity. Additionally, before he died, he was in the planning stages of a collaboration with Warren Ellis. Ellis refuses to reveal any hints as to what the project was even about.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardGorey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardGorey">Edward Gorey</a>'s death left his last work, "The Izzard Book" (a collection of words beginning with Z, with pictures), poignantly unfinished: The illustrations become increasingly (and randomly) rough and sketchy until there's nothing left. He also died before doing the illustrations to The Admonitory Hippopotamus.
</li><li> Charles M. Schulz at least had the sense to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">declare</a> that even if he'd lived forever, some things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> would never be concluded. There was, thus, no carefully hidden strip in which Charlie Brown gets the little red-haired girl, or in which Snoopy finished off the Red Baron. Nonetheless, he still only barely avoided this. He died the night before his final strip (written months prior) was released.
</li><li> Within the same issue of an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron">X-Wing Rogue Squadron</a></em> comic, there is a sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>. The reason for the abrupt shift into a fairly unpleasant style is because the artist, Edvin Biukovic, had to quit due to health problems, which he later died from.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a></em>: Although <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveSim">Dave Sim</a> did not die while making Cerebus, he had "planned ahead" (using this term very loosely) in case this happened. He had mentioned in interviews that, if he DID die before completing the series, the series would continue all the way to issue 300, but all subsequent issues would only have the background art (by Sim's colleague Gerhard). There would be no characters nor text/narrative of any kind.
</li><li> Marshall Rodgers died in the middle of <em>Cap'n Quick and a Foozle</em>, just as the title characters enter a dimensional vortex. The Captain's last known words: "Oh yeah. I forgot to tell you about this part."
</li><li> Willy Vandersteen left very specific instructions behind for the continuation of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em> franchise after his death. No character could ever age, or change, no main character may ever be dropped or added, and sex is a taboo, and a number of situations may never be altered (Lambik and Sidonia may never wed). Vandersteen died in 1990, but had given up artistic control of the <em>Suske en Wiske</em> franchise in 1972; to this day his wishes remain the guiding principles of the comic - though it must be said that his successors have seriously pushed it in almost unrecognizable directions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GastonLagaffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GastonLagaffe">Gaston Lagaffe</a></em> ended after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreFranquin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreFranquin">Andr&eacute; Franquin</a>'s death in 1997.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a> started a project called <em>Phantom Force</em> shortly before he died. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a> published the first two issues, with many of their top artists (Todd McFarlane, Erik Larsen, Jim Lee, Jerry Ordway, Jim Valentino and Keith Giffen, among others) inking Kirby's pages. The story arc was finished by Kirby collaborator Greg Theakston.
</li><li> Dudley Watkins died at his drawing board in 1969. As a result, several notable strips from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCThomson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCThomson">DC Thomson</a>'s weekly anthology comics needed new artists immediately. An incomplete <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">Biffo the Bear</a></em> strip was completed by David Sutherland, who took over as its artist from then on. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy">Desperate Dan</a></em> became a reprint, so hard was it to find a suitable replacement (Ken Harrison eventually took over in 1983). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeezer">The Beezer</a></em>'s cover star Ginger and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTopper">The Topper</a></em>'s cover star Mickey the Monkey both also had to be taken on by other artists. Biffo and Mickey were removed from the covers a few years later.
</li><li> Narrowly averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics">French</a> comic writer/artist Fred. After a 27 year hiatus, he published his coda to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Philemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Philemon">Phil&eacute;mon</a></em> before dying two months later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RicHochet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RicHochet">Ric Hochet</a></em>: Co-creator Tibet passed away in 2010. Similar to <em>Tintin and Alph-Art</em>, the album has been released in an incomplete state. Duch&acirc;teau is still around, but a reboot entitled <em>The New Adventures of Ric Hochet</em> was made in 2015 with new writers.
</li><li> The Marvel parody series What-The has an in-universe example: The super-crossover-all-in-multibrawl-megaevent leads to the author "keeling over by a heart attack. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">Moral: Team-books kill.</a>"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Wonder Woman (1942)</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> creator William Moulton Marston died of cancer in 1947, and dispite working under a pen name which he shared with Joye Murchison on the comic DC did not keep Murchison on as writer, and instead replaced him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertKanigher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertKanigher">Robert Kanigher</a> who had a very different take on the Amazon princess and the rest of the cast, and placed everyone he didn't put on a bus in far more traditional gender roles.
</li><li> Chilean screenwriter and cartoonist Marco Rauch, founder of the publisher Mythica Ediciones, passed away in April 2020, leaving many projects on hold, such as the third - and final - volume of the epic fantasy comic Cronicas de Myhtica, as well as new volumes of of his most successful work, <em>Zombies en la Moneda</em>, and a possible spin-off called <em>Zombies in the White House</em>.
</li><li> German illustrator and comic artist, Harald Siepermann (<a class="urllink" href="https://haraldsiepermann.com/2018/02/18/alfred-j-kwak-comic-book-31st-anniversary/">responsible for the character designs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlfredJKwak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlfredJKwak">Alfred J.

</li><li> The newspaper comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> could be seen as either an example of the trope or a narrow aversion of it. While creator Charles M. Schulz died the day before the final Sunday strip was published, he was aware of his failing health and had planned to conclude the strip precisely where it actually ended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KrazyKat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KrazyKat">Krazy Kat</a></em> was created during an era when cartoonists had virtually no creative control over their work. So when creator George Herriman died during the comic's run, it was expected that the strip would be passed to a new artist by the newspaper. But in a-then unprecedented move, the publisher ended the strip with Herriman's death. It turned out that they had tried to find a replacement in the event of the author's passing, but they could never find a cartoonist who could replicate Herriman's one-of-a-kind style.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Jucika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Jucika">Jucika</a></em>'s creator P&aacute;l Pusztai died of heart failure a day after his magazine had published what turned out to be his last comic, in September 1970. A poem collection about the comic also went unreleased out of respect &mdash; at least until someone finally published it in 2009.
</li><li> Elzie Segar wrote and drew <em>Thimble Theater</em>, which you know as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>, along with his other strip <em>Sappo</em>, until near the end of his life in 1938. He'd started giving the work to assistants, but still handled the storylines. He was drafting a comeback for the wildly popular Sea Hag when leukemia complicated by liver failure caught up with him and killed him. He was 46.

</li><li> Cody Scheetz, a prominent writer on the Deadfrontier forums, died in a gun accident halfway through writing the second novel of the Biohazard Nation series. In addition to the story never being resolved, plans to pitch the series for dead tree publication were abandoned since he'd expressed wishes not to publish until he'd had the chance to revamp his earlier writing.

It was cut short just around the time the Earth King equivalent was introduced. The author, Lyralocke, died somewhat unexpectedly of heart problems.

Shortly after his last full chapter was published, the writer was involved in a near-fatal accident. He spent two weeks in a coma and then spent further weeks learning to use his arms and legs again. Nearly two months after the accident, he finally posted a short note to his fans letting them know what happened and that, as soon as he has the time and energy, will be continuing his stories.

</li><li> While nothing happened to the author, we do get a meta version; the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> fic <em>Sister Directions</em> was deleted after the death of Christina Grimmie, whom the author cast as main character Freya.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a>. Though, contrary to certain urban legends, he did not cryogenically (or otherwise) preserve any part of his body and did not tell his employees exactly what to do after he left. In fact, the only project where a valid case could be made that he guided his employees following his passing was in the completion of a film he had planned based on A.A. Milne's <em>Winnie the Pooh</em> books; this culminated in the release of the complete feature, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em>, in 1977 - over a decade after his passing. (This is why his name, and not that of his eponymous company, appears on the featurettes which went into full production following his death, save for one last featurette made in 1983 which still had his name instead of the company's on the closing title, and the complete feature.) The last Disney film made entirely during his lifetime was 1967's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook1967">The Jungle Book (1967)</a></em>.

Varney's friend Blake Clark supplied Slinky's voice for the third film and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4">the fourth film</a>, since it was felt that Slinky was too important to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">disappear offscreen</a>.

According to those who worked with him, he signed on <em>knowing</em> he wouldn't live to see the finished film. The only scene Varney didn't get to record lines for was his goodbye to Milo, with Steve Barr filling in for him, instead. The film is dedicated to Varney.

As Mr. Potato Head is a major character in the series, he either had to be recast or removed entirely, neither of which was desirable as Pixar felt Rickles' personality was inseparable from the character. Ultimately, with the blessing of Rickles' estate, director Josh Cooley <a class="urllink" href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/03/28/toy-story-4-potato-head/">decided<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">to go through years of unreleased recordings</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">of Rickles playing the character</a>, much like how the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulNewman">Paul Newman</a> "reprised" his role as Doc Hudson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars3">Cars 3</a></em> almost a decade after his death, to construct a new performance for Mr. Potato Head in honor of Rickles.

Allegedly, George O'Hanlon was a somewhat poignant close call, finishing his final line moments before passing away in the recording studio; however, a handful of lines were still filled in by Bergman in the final film.

Mirage does not return in any form in the sequel.
</li><li> The character Doc Hudson was completely absent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars2">Cars 2</a></em> out of respect for his voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulNewman">Paul Newman</a>, who passed away from lung cancer in 2008.

While Ducky, her character in the former film, has had two other voice actors since then, Anne-Marie did not appear in <em>All Dogs Go To Heaven 2</em> as a result of her death.

Thus, <em>Over the Moon</em> is her last film. It was later scheduled for release in Fall 2020.

</li><li> Robert Gulliaume (voice of Rafiki) died two years before the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing2019">The Lion King</a></em> was released and two years after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em> came out.

This might also affect the aforementioned reboot of <em>Timon and Pumbaa</em>, as he had his own segment on the show.

However, the show's producer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnNathanTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnNathanTurner">John Nathan-Turner</a>, pretty much rejected Holmes' planned ending (which featured the Doctor and the Valeyard [or the Master] falling through a "time vent", with no way out) as being too risky, given that the show was hanging by a thread and that said ending would give the BBC the excuse to cancel the series. As a result, Saward quit the show in protest, and legal complications meant that the writers who eventually took on the job (Pip and Jane Baker) weren't allowed to be told how Holmes and Saward had planned to conclude the story. Thankfully, the Bakers managed to do enough to help keep the series running for some time afterward, and even when the series was finally taken off the air by the BBC in 1989, it didn't prove to be permanent (though for most people, a 16-year wait can feel pretty permanent when one isn't able to see the future).
</li><li> The show's spin-off series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em>, was prematurely killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElisabethSladen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElisabethSladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a>'s death from cancer. Half of Series 5 was finished by this point, but with the show revolving around her (and canon having established that her character would live longer), they had to stop production of any future episodes then and there. The final complete episodes were aired, drawing the series to an abrupt close.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShotaroIshinomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShotaroIshinomori">Shotaro Ishinomori</a> died while writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga">Kamen Rider Kuuga</a></em>. He knew he would die soon, and wanted to get one more <em>Kamen Rider</em> out before he died. In addition, he wrote the story-intended-to-be-series <em>Onigeki Hibiki</em>, which was only published posthumously as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderHibiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderHibiki">Kamen Rider Hibiki</a></em>.

However, any hope that the series could be picked up again was lost when Mark Frankel, the actor who played the Prince of the City (and was considered one of the show's assets), was killed in a motorcycle crash soon after the final episode aired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riget">Riget</a></em> ended after two seasons with many loose ends and at least one further season completely scripted, due to the deaths of three key actors: Ernst-Hugo J&auml;reg&aring;rd (Stig Helmer), Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), and Morten Rotne Leffers (male dishwasher).
</li><li> Just like the Ocean&#146;s series above, Alfonso Ribero has stated that any hope of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em> reunion/reboot died with James Avery on December 31st, 2013.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> just managed to avoid this. Dermot Morgan, the actor behind the titular character, tragically died of a sudden heart attack <em>24 hours</em> after filming wrapped on the series' final episode. To quote Wikipedia, "The irony of Morgan's death, at a time when after twenty years of struggle, he had finally achieved financial and artistic freedom, was not lost on his family and friends and commented on by his colleagues in the media." This has actually led to a belief that <em>Father Ted</em> was cancelled because of his death, when in fact, it was intended to end after three seasons. British TV show seasons are very short compared to American TV show seasons. His death did still invoke this trope, though, as a new series he was thinking of doing had to be scrapped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treme">Treme</a></em> writer David Mills, who had also worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, died of an aneurysm while on set just days before the show's premiere.

He had a stroke, <em>was put in a medically-induced coma, woke up, wrote to the film crew to keep shooting, and <strong>then</strong></em> died. In case you couldn't tell, he was something of a badass. Phil was also the only member of the show who had previously come closest to dying (he broke a rib, which dislodged a blood clot).
</li><li> Steve Irwin, aka the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter">Crocodile Hunter</a></em>, was killed in a freak accident with a stingray while filming the documentary <em>Ocean's Deadliest</em> with Philippe Cousteau Jr. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCollaboration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCollaboration">was posthumously featured</a> in his daughter's show, <em>Bindi the Jungle Girl</em>. According to his wife, Terri, he had laid out ten years' worth of plans for Australia Zoo, their family's home base, before he died; Australia Zoo is now (2020) the setting for the sequel series <em>Crikey! It's the Irwins</em>, and Steve often appears on the show through old footage and family reminiscences.
</li><li> An in-show example: The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> series of novels by Carver Edlund (aka Chuck Shurley) is actually a written account of the lives of Sam and Dean Winchester, written by a divine prophet. The series ends on the sadistic cliffhanger which is "No Rest for the Wicked," (the finale of season 3) when the publishers ran into financial troubles, mirroring fears of the effects of the writers strike at the time. Despite this, he kept writing his books but couldn't publish them because Sam and Dean found out about it. "We have guns, and we'll find you." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's possible that the series through "Swansong" will be published posthumously. Unfortunately, this will not improve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">cliffhanger</a> situation. At the end of "Swansong", Chuck disappears and is presumed dead by Castiel (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> initially stated he <em>was</em> God, and simply left Sam and Dean to it) so the series can never be resumed.</span> In season nine it is revealed that new volumes of the series are being published on the Internet.

All the more disturbing because he killed himself a few <em>hours</em> after taping his final episode, "Ed Talks to God."

The show was pulled immediately, a presumed difficult decision for the network, considering that the series premiered to decent ratings and they had spent quite a bit of time in the preceding weeks promoting the series on their other programs. They eventually aired the remaining eight episodes later in the Summer of 2011, with co-host Jessica Chobot becoming a correspondent for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XPlay">X-Play</a></em> in order to fulfill her contract for <em>Proving Ground</em>, which was discontinued with no chance of revival.

When Nichols died in real life, the character of Else died as well. (Ironically, the episodes concerning Else's very real death were adapted from the <em>Archie Bunker's Place</em> episodes centered around Edith's death - which only occurred on the show after Jean Stapleton quit.)
</li><li> Andy Whitfield, who played the title character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpartacusBloodAndSand">Spartacus: Blood and Sand</a></em>, was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in 2010. This caused production to halt while Andy went through treatment. During this time, Starz produced a prequel series <em>Gods of the Arena</em>. Andy gave his blessing for the network to recast his character so the series could resume. He was declared cancer-free two months after <em>Gods of the Arena</em> aired, but succumbed to a recurring disease in September 2011.

</li><li> On Fox's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>, main cast member Cory Monteith, who played Finn, died in July 2013. It was decided that Finn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">would be killed off</a> in the 5x03 episode "The Quarterback", with the show ending in 2015.
<ul><li> Likewise, any future <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> projects will have to explain the absences of Noah &#147;Puck&#148; Puckerman and Santana Lopez after the former&#146;s actor, Mark Salling, committed suicide in 2018 while awaiting charges on possession of child pornography and the latter&#146;s actress, Naya Rivera, drowned in Lake Piru in 2020.

In 2013, 60-something George R.R. Martin, author of the book series upon the program is based, revealed that he outlined his planned conclusion for the series to the showrunners, both so they could plan ahead, and also as insurance should he ever be unable to complete the final two books.
<ul><li> A character from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">source material</a> who was set to appear in Season 5 did not do so. Why? Because the actor who played him died in the middle of filming, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">and the show's creators opted to not recast out of respect.</a>

Instead of re-casting his character, the writers wrote his character out.

The show put on long-term hiatus in June 2009, after its first and only season, so that Swayze could take the time to deal with his health issues. The intention was that the show would return once Swayze got better, but he died in September; the show was canceled as a result.
</li><li> Following John McLaughlin's death on August 16, 2016, it was decided that the panel would tape one last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMcLaughlinGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMcLaughlinGroup">The McLaughlin Group</a></em> the following Friday before saying "Bye-bye!" for good, save for an hour-long retrospective in the planning stages at the time of the announcement.
</li><li> A few Brazilian soap operas had actors dying before their completion. The standout cases are ones where the death was not due to disease: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniella_Perez">Daniella Perez<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was murdered by a castmate in 1992, and Domingos Montagner drowned in 2016. Both also had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">sad plot connections</a> (Perez' assassin was her on-screen lover, while <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/shannonsims/2016/09/15/beloved-brazil-actor-whose-character-recently-survived-drowning-drowns-in-same-river/#788da13872e3">Montagner's character survived drowning in the very river the actor died in<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). Perez's death, halfway through the plot of a telenovela written by her mother Gloria, was more difficult to handle: Gloria took two weeks out (during which other authors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">wrote the victim and perpetrator out of the plot</a>), once back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">added a subplot involving the legal system</a>, and had to finish the soap opera two months before planned. Montagner's, close to the story's conclusion, only had any scenes he hadn't filmed yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">rewritten from his character's point of view to imply Montagner's presence</a>.
</li><li> Less than a week after the 2016 Presidential election, Gwen Ifill, the widely-respected moderator for <em>Washington Week</em>, died of endometrial cancer just as America was in the process of entering an era where her insight as a journalist would be needed more than ever. For months afterwards, the show did not have a permanent host as PBS searched for a journalist who would be ready to fill the big shoes Ifill had left.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiguelFerrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiguelFerrer">Miguel Ferrer</a> died of throat cancer, his character Owen Granger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> was written off as taking care of some "unfinished business".
</li><li> After the death of lead actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPaxton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPaxton">Bill Paxton</a>, the producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrainingDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrainingDay">Training Day</a></em> stated that there were no plans to recast his role, were the show to be renewed for a second season (which ultimately didn't happen).
</li><li> Oscar-winning film director Jonathan Demme died on April 26, 2017, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony">the same day</a> that an episode of the miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShotsFired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShotsFired">Shots Fired</a></em> that he had directed was first aired.
</li><li> Narrowly averted by <em>Sewing with Nancy</em>; host Nancy Zieman had the sense to announce her retirement in September 2017 following a terminal cancer diagnosis, ultimately passing on the day after the final episode was broadcast just over two months later.
</li><li> John Dunsworth, perhaps best known as Jim Lahey of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrailerParkBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrailerParkBoys">Trailer Park Boys</a></em>, passed away on October 16, 2017. Given that he was one of the series' main characters, this leaves the future of the series uncertain. It also meant that "Dear Santa, Go Fuck Yourself", their live Christmas tour, had to be postponed on rather short notice, as there was no way they could rewrite all of his lines in such a short span of time. (The tour was moved to April, and is now called "A Fucked Up Evening with the Trailer Park Boys".)

Then, he had different guest critics substituting for Siskel until he chose Richard Roeper for his new co-host. The show went on until 2006, when Ebert began battling thyroid cancer and different guest critics started substituting for him. The show was cancelled in 2010, and Ebert himself died on April 4, 2013.

Given the positive response to that episode, along with Patty's own enjoyment of working there, it's likely that these would have become recurring roles for her.

It has since been confirmed the show will end after Season 12, which will feature the final episodes Bourdain filmed.
</li><li> <em>Fashion Police</em> did not last very long after the 2014 passing of co-host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanRivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanRivers">Joan Rivers</a>.
</li><li> Television host Larry Blyden, best known for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsMyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsMyLine">What's My Line?</a></em>, died of a car accident in Morocco in 1975.

As a result, creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson">Mark Goodson</a> hastily replaced him with Bobby Van.
</li><li> This happened again on another Mark Goodson-created game show in 1990. Bert Convy (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tattletales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tattletales">Tattletales</a></em>, <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinLoseOrDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WinLoseOrDraw">Win, Lose or Draw</a></em>) had taped pilot episodes for the 1990 revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em>, but he had to retire due to an inoperable brain tumor that ultimately took his life in 1991. Taking his place for the actual series was Ross Shafer.

This was averted by his successor Rod Roddy, who enlisted several substitutes before his own death in 2003 and thus did not announce posthumously.
</li><li> Also true of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> and its announcers. Jack Clark died of bone cancer in 1988 and was replaced by M. G. Kelly for a few months before original announcer Charlie O'Donnell returned. While Jack did not announce posthumously, there are a few episodes near the end of his tenure where he sounds particularly unwell. O'Donnell also averted this with his own 2010 death: while he had taped several episodes that would not air until after his death, the show chose instead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameLanguageDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SameLanguageDub">overdub his work with that of other announcers</a> before seeking a replacement.
</li><li> The seventh syndicated season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild">The Joker's Wild</a></em> was already planned to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry">Jack Barry</a>'s last. On the following season's premiere, Barry was to announce his retirement and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">hand the mike over to substitute host Jim Peck</a>. During the hiatus, Barry went into fatal cardiac arrest while jogging in Central Park. Barry's partner Dan Enright instead picked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCullen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCullen">Bill Cullen</a> to host, and the show lasted another two years under his tenure.

While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FXNetworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FXNetworks">FX</a> plans to air the season as scheduled, it's unclear how the show plans to move forward without Singleton.
</li><li> Any revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> on TV will have to deal with Jim Phelps' actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterGraves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterGraves">Peter Graves</a> dying in 2010, assuming that Phelps won't be replaced.

As a result, the show became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunner">Short Runner</a> with only 23 episodes in the can.

Justin Campbell took over the role as a result.
</li><li> Puppet example: Several Muppets that returned in <em>Muppets Now</em> had to be rebuilt since their original puppets got destroyed or deteriorated several years prior.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ever-so-narrowly averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a>: while he filmed his last segments for <em>Sesame Street</em> a year before his passing, he had many other projects that never got off the ground (or took a long time in doing so) after he died in 1990, most notably the selling of the Muppet characters to Disney, which wouldn't go through until 2004. Puppeteer Steve Whitmire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">took over as Kermit</a> almost immediately and - after spending several years as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">The Voiceless</a> - began performing Ernie as well in 1993.
</li><li> Also averted with Jerry Nelson, who passed in 2012. Due to fading health, his Muppet involvement had mostly been reduced to voicing his characters on <em>Sesame Street</em>, with other puppeteers having taken over the majority of his characters prior to his death. Afterwards, Matt Vogel took over the characters that Jerry was still voicing, including the Count.
</li><li> Unfortunately played straight with Richard Hunt, whose 1992 passing resulted in many of his characters (including most, if not all, of his <em>Sesame</em> characters) being retired or reduced to bit parts for many years.
</li><li> Another aversion was Carroll Spinney, who retired a year before his death, though several segments he recorded would not air until afterwards<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fsqj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2fsqj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fsqj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">however, the last episode he was involved in had his vocals dubbed over with Matt Vogel, possibly because Carroll's age was very much showing through his voice at that point</span>. The first new episode to air after his passing featured an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam">In Memoriam</a> tag at the end that said, "Thank you for bringing so much life to Big Bird and Oscar. We'll miss you, Carroll."
<ul><li> This trope almost happened to Spinney 33 years before his actual death. In 1986, he was invited to go on the ill-fated Challenger mission as a civilian passenger. However, he rejected the offer, and social studies teacher Christa McAuliffe was chosen instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Joe Raposo, the show's songwriter, died on February 5, 1989 of lymphoma. New songs that he had written for this show appeared until 1990, with one nabbing him a posthumous Emmy.
<ul><li> Joe also wrote several songs for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em>, including its theme song; that show aired its' second episode on the day he died. He only wrote songs for the first season, with Margaret Jones writing songs that appeared later in the show's run.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the most famous example of this trope was Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper during the show's first decade. He was ill with cancer during his later years on the show, and passed away from it in 1982. The cast decided to make an episode in response to his death, which became one of <em>Sesame Street</em>'s signature moments.
</li><li> Jeff Moss died of cancer in 1998; he wrote his last song, "You and You and Me", the day of his death. The song was filmed in January 1999.
</li><li> Michael Jeter, who played Mr. Noodle's brother, suffered a fatal seizure in 2003, while the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElmosWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElmosWorld">Elmo's World</a></em> segments were still in production.

To honour his work on the series, Capcom's writing team decided to leave the story on a cliffhanger and not refer to groups like H.C.F., which were entirely his creation. The cliffhanger, which saw <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wesker assemble an army intent on destroying Umbrella and selling its assets to terrorists</span>, was somewhat resolved in Wesker's favour in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, through the circumstances themselves were left vague.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series was supposed to have one more game to tie up all the loose ends. However, the departure of series writer Amy Hennig for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">uncharted</a> waters and the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyJay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyJay">Tony Jay</a>, one of the major voice actors, means that the series is now in limbo. Not only did Hennig leave, but two of the other main writers (out of a group of four, with Hennig being the lead and most well known) also left the company as well. The fourth? He passed away.

While others working on the project tried their best to keep it alive, development has officially ceased, with only a single bug release update left that has yet to show.
</li><li> A sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Illbleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Illbleed">Illbleed</a></em> was going to be developed, but the death of the president of Climax Graphics, makers of the series, stopped all plans for it.
</li><li> Tragedy struck for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> franchise when Tsuyoshi Takishita, the 37-year-old voice actor who'd famously voiced the character Sima Yi for <em>every</em> installment &mdash; seven main games plus side games, spanning over a decade &mdash; succumbed to injuries from a bad fall on his way home less than two weeks after the release of <em>Shinsangokumusou 7</em> (<em>Dynasty Warriors 8</em>).

Knowing Banpresto, however, it might not be such a problem as they would simply re-use her pre-recorded lines (as they have kept using recorded voices of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirotakaSuzuoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirotakaSuzuoki">Hirotaka Suzuoki</a> to voice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daitarn3">Banjo Haran</a> long after his death), but it might come at the cost of Excellen having lesser prominence compared to before, something that has been happened since probably <em>2nd Original Generations</em>.
</li><li> The planned sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blasto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blasto">Blasto</a></em> was cancelled due to the aforementioned Phil Hartman's murder-suicide two months after the first game's release.

</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://captainn.net/main.html">N-Fans: The Series<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> began to flounder in 2007, when creator Webster Swenson passed away unexpectedly. The people who inspired the other characters made a few attempts to revive the series and keep it going in his memory, but the entire website has stagnated since early 2008; the one exception is the forums, which managed to remain active until 2015.
</li><li> Angel "Inqy" Yates of <em>Wicked Alchemy</em> wrote on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> about her declining health not long before her sudden death in the summer of 2009. In addition to the webcomic, she also had a slice-of-life comic strip, <em>Onna Chance</em>, and a pirate avatar game. Sadly, <em>Onna Chance</em> and her original site Mutedfaith are both down, more than a year after her death.
</li><li> <em>Bad Bunny</em>: After doing a reprint of a classic set of strips for Pennsic, it looked like the author Wolfie was going to get back to the original strip's storyline of pants too tight (this is a strip where the mundane becomes insanely funny). Unfortunately, Wolfie - real name W. Michael Dooley - contracted H1N1, and died aged 41 in December 2009.
</li><li> Tom Siddell, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>, joked that due to his strip buffer, if he were to keel over and die this instant, we'd still get about three months' worth of strips.
</li><li> The creator of <em>Just Another Webcomic</em> passed away after coming out of a coma. He was only nine pages into the third volume of his work, which he was unable to continue after the coma because he had lost a lot of sensation in his drawing arm.
</li><li> It's a common joke among the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em> fandom that no one will notice when Howard Tayler dies, due to his <em>perfect</em> update schedule.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4temx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4temx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4temx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The comic has gone its entire nearly 14-year run with new strips every day. Once, the day's strip was late by several hours. Because the server's power supply had exploded with enough force to destroy three walls.</span> At the end of the universe, there will be a few scattered neutrinos, some clumps of exotic matter, and <em>Schlock Mercenary</em>, still updating every 24 hours without fail.
</li><li> In October of 2012, DrunkDuck featured <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.theduckwebcomics.com/Adventures_of_Wristance/">The Adventures of Wristance<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> on its front page. Unfortunately, however, creator Distance Erin Larkins was unable to enjoy the attention, as she had committed suicide mere days before the featuring.
</li><li> The future of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SugarBits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SugarBits">Sugar Bits</a></em> remains to be seen since the passing of the comic's writer Dondi "DMajorBoss" Bethea, who lost his life to cancer on May 6th, 2013.
</li><li> In early December of 2016, Bryan Spiegler, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Middleways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Middleways">Middleways</a></em> died of a heart attack. His wife has claimed the story will continue, but she does not have access to all his art and notes.
</li><li> Albert Temple, aka Gene Catlow of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneCatlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneCatlow">Gene Catlow</a></em>, was found dead of natural causes in his apartment on March 9, 2017. The comic is planned to be concluded based upon his remaining notes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FlutteringFeelings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FlutteringFeelings">Fluttering Feelings</a></em> was cut short because of the artist's cancer diagnosis in 2016. In 2018 she passed away.

<ul><li> WWE superstar Michael "Hawk" Hegstrand appeared with his partner Joe "Animal" Laurinatis on the May 17, 2003 <em>WWE RAW</em> and despite his history of severe drug and alcohol abuse, performed exceptionally well, as he had finally gotten completely clean. According to those who knew him, Hegstrand had dedicated himself to staying drug-free for the rest of his life; unfortunately, his years of drug abuse had taken such a physical toll on his body that he died of a heart attack six months later. He, unlike many drug addicts and alcoholics, managed to live up to hope - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">he remained clean for the rest of his life</a>.
