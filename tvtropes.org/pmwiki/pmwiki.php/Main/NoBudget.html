<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">public service announcements</a> aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmericanForcesNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmericanForcesNetwork">American Forces Network</a> tend to be this. The most infamous example is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpOb_qSggGE">this recycling PSA<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The creator of this PSA said that it was filmed on their own time and done with their own money.
</li><li> Some companies would just buy ad space for a TV commercial which merely consist of a static image and a voiceover extolling the virtues of whatever it is they're selling. Such as in the case of a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/cFk8QIZvnTI">toothpaste brand in the Philippines<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> during the 80s, though they did eventually go for a more conventional approach with licenced characters used for their children's line as well.
</li><li> New Zealand supermarket chain Pak'n'Save lampshades this in its TV adverts with the tagline, "Everything we do, to save you money". The adverts make use of simple stick-figure animation.
</li><li> The infamous ASPCA PSA's are guilty of this trope. The same footage of sad looking animals set to royalty-free sad piano music with the spot in the ad for the ASPCA Magazine having the cheapest looking-CGI imaginable.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anime and Manga&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Anime in general is actually made on half or less of a western cartoon's budget. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0w2do');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0w2do" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0w2do');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Anime tends to average about $123,000 per episode, whereas western cartoons tend to run about $300,000 per episode.</span> However, the last two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> show what happens when even <em>that</em> runs out; the action-packed ending is later made into a movie and the TV series is rounded out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">philosophical exploration</a> of the characters' inner psyches, the representation of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Instrumentality from the characters' and then Shinji's perspectives</span>.
</li><li> On the North American side, if you are curious as to why voice actors don't get paid much in working anime compared to doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">pre-lay</a>, and why some anime titles are released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDubForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDubForYou">without dubs</a>, this is mainly because those who work to release the anime in North America are given limited budget because anime in general is a very niche nerd interest when compared to Marvel and DC Comics, largely because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicMediumIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicMediumIgnorance">people's perception towards anime</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15crv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15crv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15crv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> will make people think that it's for kids and kids only when clearly it isn't; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAdultAnimationIsSouthPark">All Adult Animation Is South Park</a> will make people think that animation aimed at older audiences will only work if it's a vulgar, raunch-filled comedy; and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">All Anime Is Naughty Tentacles</a> will make people think that anime's nothing but sordid, lecherous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hentai">hentai</a></span> <em>unless</em> if you are talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchises</a> such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. If a title needs around 3,000 units to break even (and this is <em>without</em> an English dub), then it gives you the idea of how limited anime budget tends to be in North America (as opposed to many popular video games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> and even niche <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JRPG">JRPGs</a> where units can sell <em>tens of thousands</em> or even <em>millions</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> was made on a limited budget. However, the creators embraced their limitation with stock footage, stylised animation and surreal environments, making it one of the most visually distinctive animated series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em>, in spite of the series' stellar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeArt">Awesome Art</a> moments, was made on a rather tight budget compared to similar shows that premiered around the time, resulting in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation">Limited Animation</a> moments (episode 4 and 22 being the biggest cases). Nui Harime actually uses this to show how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">inhuman</a></em> she is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LostUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LostUniverse">Lost Universe</a></em> was made during the southeastern Asia financial crisis of 1998, and most animation studios that year were given meager budgets to begin with. Also, a fire partially destroyed the studio that animated the episodes, resulting in the first bunch of them being of a sketchy, poor quality (since they had been completed, they couldn't have been fixed after the fire). The fourth episode had to be animated in South Korea for this reason<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2guu6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2guu6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2guu6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the other episodes had also used studios in South Korea, but not to the same extent</span>, and it was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> that the episode title became synonymous in Japan for bad animation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ViolinistOfHameln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ViolinistOfHameln">Violinist of Hameln</a></em> has the nickname "Slideshow of Hameln" for this reason, as the budget only allowed for animation in non-action scenes. Most of the money that <em>should</em> have gone towards the animation instead went towards purchasing the rights to use the classical music pieces that Hamel and Raiel play.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MusashiGundoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MusashiGundoh">Musashi Gundoh</a></em>, to the point that it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> purely based on its terrible animation. Much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>-ness was cleaned up for the DVD release. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItWasBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItWasBetter">Fans were not pleased.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends">Kemono Friends</a></em> had a staff of only 10 people working over 500 days with a budget that was extremely limited and had to make extensive use of CGI, and even the director had no clue how it gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">the kind of popularity that it did</a> despite all of this.
</li><li> Joseph Lai's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/SpaceThunderKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/SpaceThunderKids">Space Thunder Kids</a></em> is entirely made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">stock animation</a> from other low-budget anime titles that were made at the time, resulting in an incredibly bizarre and incoherent end result of a film.

However, only <em>$7,225</em> actually went into the making of the film, as it was originally going to be direct-to-video. The rest was later provided by Columbia Pictures to help get the film a theatrical release. In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UOa7tkByrw">The Robert Rodriguez<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLxqNwc1oYU">10 Minute Film School<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and his book <em>Rebel Without a Crew</em>, the director lists the at times crazy techniques used to make the film on such a low budget:
<ul><li> The camera was a borrowed 16mm that came with no manual, so he needed to call a store in Texas to help identify the camera and teach him how to work it. To avoid spending too much money on film, everything was shot in only one or two takes (though he admits to spending more than expected because he only bought as much as he needed, keeping him from using bulk discounts). To give the illusion of multiple cameras, he would freeze the action after a few seconds and move to another spot to keep going.
</li><li> The film was transferred to 3/4" video, saving tens of thousands of dollars that would have instead been spent on making a film negative, and edited entirely on video. The resulting video copy is what got shopped around, and Columbia ponied up the money to make a 35mm film print for theatrical release.
</li><li> Incorporating bloopers into the plot in order to avoid retakes and simply cutting to another angle to disguise mistakes.
</li><li> All of the firing guns were real guns because he couldn't afford blank-converted ones from a rental armory (the submachine guns were borrowed from the local Mexican police!). Because the automatics would jam on the first round with blanks due to lacking a bullet to provide force working the action, he would copy the firing frames or cut away from the shooting while playing a canned machine gun sound effect and having actors drop handfuls of casings on the ground to provide the illusion of automatic gunfire. The guns that weren't real were water guns.
</li><li> The only non-natural light was a pair of 250-watt desk lamps with some improvised filters and reflectors.
</li><li> As the title of his book suggests, there was <em>no crew</em>. Rodriguez did everything himself from the writing and filming to the sound recording and editing. Because actors would otherwise be standing around doing nothing, he had them act as extra hands when needed.
</li><li> The camera couldn't sync to a sound recorder and was too loud to record sound while filming anyway, so he shot the film silently and recorded dialogue and foley on set a few minutes later. When the dialogue didn't perfectly match the lip movements during post-production, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmingForEasyDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmingForEasyDub">he used cuts to other angles to take the mouth off-screen</a>.
</li><li> They had two guitar cases: a black one for the mariachi's guitar and a brown one with the guns (modified with straps on the inside for the weapons). Unfortunately, the cases are <em>both</em> supposed to be black. Rodriguez would simply film the black case being opened and then cut to the already open brown case.

The complete lack of a budget makes the relatively high production values and competently produced visual and makeup effects even more impressive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardwareWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardwareWars">Hardware Wars</a></em> was, relative to its budget, one of the most profitable films of all time, making over $1M on a budget of $8,000.
</li><li> Other than financial grants from the French government and producers who took interest in the film's premise, the 2016 Filipino romantic comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingSally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingSally">Saving Sally</a></em> was made in <em>ten years</em> on a &#8369;10,000 budget. That's around <em>$200</em>! It did pay off as the film earned &#8369;27 million or roughly $600,000 to positive reviews, which while definitely not to the same level of fiancial success as a mainstream <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed">Metro Manila Film Festival</a> feature, is still commendable for an independent production.

It received strong reviews, but critics complained that the dialogue was made even more impenetrable by the terrible sound quality in some scenes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s first feature film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Following" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Following">Following</a></em>, cost about $6-$7,000. The cast and crew were all employed full-time, so everything was filmed on weekends. Every scene was extensively rehearsed, because they didn't have enough film stock for more than two takes. Nolan used his friends' and family's homes for location shooting, and had to film with natural lighting.

</li><li> <em>Slashers</em> was shot on a single handheld camera in a paintball arena. This was an appropriate choice, since the cameraman was also a character, hired by the titular game show to keep a live image of the contestants as they attempted to survive the killers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCastle">The Castle</a></em> was made on a budget of AU$19,000. Not only that, but it was filmed in 11 days because the budget didn't stretch enough to cater anymore.

The result was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Targets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Targets">Targets</a></em>.
</li><li> Constantin Film had to make a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> movie quickly to retain the film rights. They handed Corman $1.4M, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFantasticFour">it was made</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshCanCopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshCanCopy">but not released</a>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFistfulOfDollars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFistfulOfDollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a></em> was made on the set of a much crappier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaghettiWestern">Spaghetti Western</a> called <em>Guns Don't Talk</em> as an attempt to recoup its budget. The actors had to provide their own costumes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em> (most of the money came from rock groups such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Genesis">Genesis</a>). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">ending</a> used was partially because the team couldn't afford the one they had written. (They'd blown too much money on the pyrotechnic effects for the Tim the Enchanter scene.)
</li><li> You can tell the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForbiddenZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForbiddenZone">Forbidden Zone</a></em> had way more ambition than they had budget to pull it off, as one can tell by the sometimes outrageously cheap-looking sets. But, given that the film is so damnably surreal, it kind of works at recreating that strange, Fleischer-cartoon feel they were going for. Plus, it helps that the director was related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DannyElfman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DannyElfman">Danny Elfman</a> and able to get him to compose a really awesome soundtrack.
</li><li> Subverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">The Room</a></em>. Extremely limited sets, very few location shots, crappy blue screen effects. Final cost? <em>$6M.</em> Tommy Wiseau wasted money like crazy, buying two cameras to film every scene side-by-side in film and HD. He spent a fair amount on buying the copyright so the characters could sing "Happy Birthday". Some people speculate that the film was a money laundering scheme, which would be where most of the supposed budget went.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s first film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BadTaste">Bad Taste</a></em> was filmed by just him and a few friends over a few years, in which their lack of budget led to things like several actors playing two or more roles, making latex moulds in the kitchen oven, and various other (sometimes quite ingenious) solutions.
<ul><li> His later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEpic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEpic">obviously</a> doesn't count, but at least one scene in the extended edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Two Towers</a></em> does: after Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas meet up with the resurrected Gandalf, Aragorn and Gandalf have a conversation at night. Apart from the opening establishing shot, the whole conversation is tight close-ups and the background is absolutely pitch-black. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Apparently</a> they shot that scene in a shed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen">12 Angry Men</a></em> partly counts as they could only afford enough film to record once, so no mistakes were allowed.
</li><li> In-universe example: <em>Chubby Rain</em>, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bowfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bowfinger">Bowfinger</a></em>. Bobby Bowfinger says the $2,184 spent are the actual budget for every blockbuster, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting">Hollywood Accounting</a> inflates it to a million-dollar figure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdemic">Birdemic</a></em>. Made for under $10,000. Where to even begin?
<ul><li> The birds are played by low-quality GIFs of hawks and vultures with poor seagull cries. They tend to explode upon striking the ground. All explosion, fire, muzzle flash, and smoke effects are likewise extremely low-quality GIFs.
</li><li> In an infamous scene, the protagonists fend off a bird attack with <em>coat hangers</em>. They were scripted to use curtain rods, but the Motel 6 used for filming had no detachable curtain rods and apparently it would have been too much money to buy them.
</li><li> Many of the businesses appear to have been filmed in while closed for the night, such as the restaurant which is completely empty except for a waiter and a singer. Only a few corporate meeting scenes have an appreciable number of extras, leaving other scenes set in diners and restaurants conspicuously empty. Filming done near roads during the actual bird apocalypse shows traffic passing unimpeded and even real birds flying around.
</li><li> The whole film appears to have been shot on a low-quality video camera with little to no editing.
</li><li> One of the extremely few practical effects in the film (birds spitting acid) was done by hurling several cartons of orange juice from off-camera onto the actors. This could only be done in one take, as that was all the orange juice they had.
</li><li> Sound editing was almost non-existent. No room tone was taken and the background noise changes wildly between angles due to it. All sound was apparently taken off the camera's own microphone, with greatly varying levels and clarity.
</li><li> Except for a few songs, all of the music is royalty-free. The infamously long opening driving scene has a short royalty-free clip simply loop multiple times.
</li><li> Filming could only take place intermittently on weekends due to everyone having day jobs, causing the movie to take <em>4 years</em> to complete.
</li></ul></li><li> The whole reason <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManosTheHandsOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManosTheHandsOfFate">Manos: The Hands of Fate</a></em> was even made was because the director had a bet going that he could make a movie based on a shoestring budget. He <em>technically</em> won...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonsterAGoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonsterAGoGo">Monster a-Go Go</a></em> started filming as a B-Movie, but ran out of budget partway through. After being shelved for a few years, it was finished in a way so cheap as to be insulting.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nollywood">Nollywood</a> (the Nigerian film industry) movies, the first cinematographic industry in volume, are like this, and a lot of times it shows. This has led to a backlash called the <em>New Nollywood</em> movement, aiming to uplift the status of Nigerian cinema from a quantity-over-quality factory of lowbrow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> fodder to a respectable industry able to keep up with those from industrialised nations. Some of these films, such as <em>The Figurine</em> and <em>The Wedding Party</em> avert this with more than decent production values, receiving critical acclaim overseas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThanksKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThanksKilling">Thanks Killing</a></em> was made for $3,000.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ViolentShit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ViolentShit">Violent Shit</a></em> was made over four weekends on a budget of $2,000.
</li><li> <em>Woodchipper Massacre</em> apparently had a budget of only $400.
</li><li> <em>MonSturd</em>, another for $3,000.
</li><li> Anything made by the Polonia brothers, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Feeders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Feeders">Feeders</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>This Is Not A Film</em> was... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">not actually a film production</a>. It's a personal video diary by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Iranian</a> political prisoner (and "former" high-profile film maker) Jafar Panahi, filmed partially on his iPhone in his own apartment. A good part of it is Panahi summarizing the story of a couple movies his government did not let him make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">because he was banned from directing, screenwriting, and interviews but not acting</a>. The video was smuggled out of Iran <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JailBake">inside a birthday cake</a></em>, and screened internationally in movie theaters to critical acclaim. Its actual budget is rather difficult to factor &#151; how much did the birthday cake cost?
</li><li> <em>Amateur Porn Star Killer</em> &#151; $45.
</li><li> <em>The Last House on Dead End Street</em> was made for $800. The budget was originally $3000, but the creator spent most of that on drugs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manborg">Manborg</a></em> had a budget of $1000, and is all the more awesome because of it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms">found footage</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBroadcast">The Last Broadcast</a></em> was made for only $900, and is notable for being one of the first films shot on video to get a theatrical release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryWolf">Cry_Wolf</a></em> is an interesting example. The producers had made a short film as a contest for Chrysler, and the prize was a million dollars. They used the money to make the film, along with quite a bit of conspicuous Chrysler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoKilledCaptainAlex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoKilledCaptainAlex">Who Killed Captain Alex?</a></em> takes the No Budget thing to the extreme, being made on a budget of roughly $200. For context, the film company that made the film lived in a slum in Uganda, so you couldn't really blame them for the money issues. It makes up for it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">with the sheer level of passion everyone put into it</a>.
</li><li> All three of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColemanFrancis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColemanFrancis">Coleman Francis</a>' directorial works play this trope in the most literal ways yet. The same actors, same locations <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12rf41');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12rf41" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12rf41');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">What few there are since all three are shot outside</span>, non-existent makeup or effects, little to no props, terrible cinematography, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">stock material</a> that never fits with the rest of the film. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeastOfYuccaFlats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeastOfYuccaFlats">The Beast of Yucca Flats</a></em> takes it to an even bigger extreme by having next to no sound at all, that is unless an actor's face is obscured so that the dialogue wouldn't have to sync up with the mouth movements. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13kn9o');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13kn9o" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13kn9o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Supposedly the crew was unable to obtain any sound equipment at the time so Coleman improvised by shooting the film as it is to stay under budget.</span> It's quite an accomplishment when you manage to make Ed Wood of all people look like a professional filmmaker in comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em> is famous for having been made on a budget of $27,575, boosted to $250K after Miramax bought the rights to it and added music. It was filmed at night in the Quick Stop where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> actually worked, and most of the actors are his friends and relatives, several of them playing multiple roles. Smith stated that he maxed out eight credit cards to make the film.
</li><li> Kevin Smith made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChasingAmy">Chasing Amy</a></em> for $250K. Initially, he was given a budget of $3M, but only if he cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidSchwimmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidSchwimmer">David Schwimmer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart">Jon Stewart</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewBarrymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewBarrymore">Drew Barrymore</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em> holds the world record for budget-to-box office performance. The cost to create the film itself has been listed as between $25,000 to $750,000. It went on to make $250 million. However, it did receive a $25 million advertising budget.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMission1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMission1999">The Mission (1999)</a></em> costs 2.5 million HK dollars, or 320K USD. Most of the money probably goes to the slick black suits worn by the six main characters throughout the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em> was made for $400K. Half of it was for the after-the-credits scene. Said scene (depicting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kip and LaFawndah's wedding, and Napoleon taming a wild stallion</span>) wasn't even part of the original release; it was added for the wide release after the film's explosive popularity at Sundance.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpstreamColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpstreamColor">Upstream Color</a></em> was made for about $50,000 and manages to both look and sound fantastic.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">Halloween (1978)</a></em> was shot on a budget of $200K, bringing in $35M (today equal to over $100M). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarpenter">John Carpenter</a> spent most of the budget on getting anamorphic lenses (to hide its low budget), so they didn't even have enough money to make a mask. Instead they just painted an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheShelfFX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheShelfFX">off-the-shelf</a> Captain Kirk mask white.

</li><li> Producer Jason Blum is famous for his low budgets and the high returns he gets off of them, which has earned him comparisons to Corman. His strategy is to give filmmakers a few million dollars (Blumhouse Productions had never made a non-sequel film with a budget exceeding $5 million) and near-complete creative freedom, and let them go wild. He's best known for his involvement in the horror genre; he made his name by producing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity">Paranormal Activity</a></em> series, and was also behind a number of other major horror films starting in the late '00s.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity">Paranormal Activity</a></em>, the first film cost $15,000 to make (and that's after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> gave money for writer/director Oren Peli to shoot another ending!) and grossed $193 million worldwide. This success allowed the filmmakers to do a sequel with the comparatively high budget of $3 million.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insidious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Insidious">Insidious</a></em> cost $1.5 million and grossed $92 million worldwide. Notably, it was written and directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesWan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesWan">James Wan</a> and Leigh Whannell, the people behind <em>Saw</em> (described below), and co-produced by Oren Peli, the maker of the aforementioned <em>Paranormal Activity</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGallows">The Gallows</a></em>, another film that Blumhouse picked up, was made for only $100,000. Since they didn't have the money for stuntmen, all of the actors had to do their own stunts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterLastSeason">After Last Season</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>: despite looking cheaper than <strike>most</strike> every single damn last one of the films on this list, it was made with a $5M budget ($40,000 which was dedicated to produc-er, renting a warehouse and a crappy video camera, the rest to post-er, hiring an editor whose services they apparently didn't use, and a college kid with a rudimentary knowledge of Blender to make the special effects).
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawI">Saw I</a></em> was made for $1.2M and grossed over $103M worldwide. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawII">Saw II</a></em> was made for $4M, and grossed over $147M. After that, they started getting an actual budget (roughly $10M per film), which probably accounts for the amped up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">gore</a> in the later sequels (more money for special effects = more gore).
</li><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists">United Artists</a> wanted a famous protagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rocky">Rocky</a></em> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> sold his script on the condition of being the star, the studio only lent $1M for production. The producers had to mortgage their houses in order to get an extra $100,000 and finish the movie. It ended up grossing $225M worldwide, winning three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a> (including Best Picture), and became one of the most famous movie franchises ever.
</li><li> In 1962, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo">Dr. No</a></em> was made for just $1M, before the effects team asked for an extra 100K to do the climactic explosion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a>'s watch was producer Cubby Broccoli's own, and when an art director found out his name wasn't in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen, saying he didn't want to spend money fixing them. This results in the most subdued Bond movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenAndArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenAndArthur">Ben &amp; Arthur</a></em> is practically the <em>Birdemic</em> of gay romance movies. Despite a budget of $40,000 (4 times that of Birdemic), it somehow manages to accomplish even less in scope.
<ul><li> The diner Ben and Arthur work in is represented by a fast food chain restaurant.
</li><li> One of the pistols used in the film is obviously a water pistol painted black. The many gunshots have no special effects except for a stock "gunshot" sound effect and cutting back to the victim with a bloody injury.
</li><li> The church set includes a "stained glass" window that looks like it was made of thin paper.
</li><li> Shots of Ben and Arthur taking an airline were apparently made by going to an airport and filming the first plane to pass close overhead. The two planes used are a FedEx cargo plane and an Alaska Airlines plane (flying from California to Vermont).
</li><li> All of the music that isn't royalty-free is composed by Sam Mraovich, the star, director, writer, and overall creator of the film.
</li><li> A Sony VX2000 camcorder with a tripod was seemingly the only camera setup used, making the film resemble a home movie. Two of the actors in the film were also credited as "cinematographers", suggesting that they hung around when not being shot to help manipulate the camera. The lack of a proper stabilizing rig makes any shots in motion very shaky and nauseating. All lighting is apparently whatever natural light was available, with one scene of Ben in a dark bedroom waking up being almost pitch black because of it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardCandy">Hard Candy</a></em> was made for $950K, mainly to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">controversial</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">topic</a>. It was filmed in 18 days, in chronological order, in the director's own house, and used a bare minimum of takes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarrenAronofsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarrenAronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a>'s first feature <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pi">&pi;</a></em> had a budget of $60,000. He didn't pay to secure outdoor locations and had one member of the crew stand by to look out for cops.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SLCPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SLCPunk">SLC Punk!</a></em> cost just $600K to make, even after its cast of familiar names, soundtrack of classic punk tracks and the use of anamorphic lenses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarginCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarginCall">Margin Call</a></em> was made on a $3M budget and made almost $20M. 90% of the film was shot on a single floor of a recently vacated trading firm. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllStarCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllStarCast">All-Star Cast</a> actors apparently liked the script so much that they agreed to the Screen Actors Guild's minimum salaries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEvilDead1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEvilDead1981">The Evil Dead (1981)</a></em> was shot for over a year with less than $375,000.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheKillerTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheKillerTomatoes">Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!</a></em> was made on a budget of $100K. The only reason they were able to afford the helicopter crash scene was because it was an unscripted accident, so the damages were covered by their insurance policy. The second movie had <em>twenty times</em> the budget of the first (which is still pretty small for a movie). It doesn't show (it also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of blatant product placements because they allegedly ran out of money partway through the film and needed an extra source of funding).
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cube">Cube</a></em> was produced for $400K. All the CG was done for free as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> moment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoChick">Repo Chick</a></em> was originally budgeted at $7M, which left one line producer wondering how (and where) they were going to secure a California Zephyr railroad car that was central to the plot. When the original financing fell through, director Alex Cox decided to shoot the actors almost entirely on green screen over 10 days, and composite in HO-scale model trains and sets in post-production. Final budget? $180,000.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">Night of the Living Dead (1968)</a></em> was done on a budget of $114,000.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoomHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoomHouse">Doom House</a></em> was filmed on a meager shoestring budget of only <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496277/business">$60,000 (estimated).<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> For years, the "official" shooting budget of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978">Dawn of the Dead (1978)</a></em> was listed as $1.5 million. It wasn't until 2004, when the "Ultimate Edition' DVD box set was released, that producer Richard Rubenstein revealed (on one of the commentary tracks) that the real number was closer to $500,000; they'd inflated the cost to make the film seem more impressive while marketing it to potential distributors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monsters2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monsters2010">Monsters</a></em> was made on $500,000 in spite of the massive, Hollywood-quality CGI monsters that play a small but vital role in the film. The locations, including monster-smashed landscapes and various exotic South American locales, are also pretty impressive. The director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarethEdwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarethEdwards">Gareth Edwards</a>, made all the CGI on his home computer, most of the locations were stolen, and many supporting characters were simply bystanders recruited to improvise scenes on the spot. The boats and trucks in trees were probably left there by previous hurricanes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler">Adam Sandler</a>'s first film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoingOverboard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoingOverboard">Going Overboard</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this trope in the opening shot. "This is a No Budget flick. Not a low budget, but a no budget!"
</li><li> Any movie by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheAsylum">The Asylum</a> typically doesn't go over the $1 million mark when it comes to budgets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrozenDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrozenDays">Frozen Days</a></em> was made on a $25,000 budget, which the creators had to raise themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Absentia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Absentia">Absentia</a></em> was a project on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>, resulting in a $70,000 budget - this led to liberal use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnotherEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnotherEarth">Another Earth</a></em> was made for about $100,000. When they needed a scene of the protagonist getting out of jail, actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BritMarling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BritMarling">Brit Marling</a> simply walked into a local prison claiming to be a yoga instructor, and then walked out again before anyone had time to realize that she wasn't, while the director filmed it all from outside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllSuperheroesMustDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllSuperheroesMustDie">All Superheroes Must Die</a></em> was made on a budget of $20,000. Several scenes were modified as the list of places they could affordably film shrank.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKentuckyFriedMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKentuckyFriedMovie">The Kentucky Fried Movie</a></em> cost only $650,000 to make and made $20 million at the box office.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenagersFromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenagersFromOuterSpace">Teenagers from Outer Space</a></em> was made on a budget of US$14,000 (with inflation that's about $114,000 today). This is indicated by such things as a toy standing in for a death ray and an extended sequence featuring a lobster dangled in front of the camera to serve as a giant alien monster.
</li><li> 20th Century Fox initially only gave $8 million to do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Star Wars</a></em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> made it climb up to a still meager $11 million (for comparison, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">the other big sci-fi movie of that year</a> cost $20 million), which amounts to $45.5 million today. And yet it became the highest grossing movie ever upon release, and made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> enough money to finance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">the following movies</a> out of his own pocket (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">the very next</a> started at much more comfortable $18 million, though once things went awry again, Lucas had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue">ask the studio for some extra cash</a>).
</li><li> Pretty much the entire filmography for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg">Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer</a> qualifies under this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody">Due to the duo's habit of writing their "parody scripts" around trailers for unreleased movies</a>, and shooting their films within short deadlines, the end results are unsurprisingly less than you'd expect. There's a reason why these two are credited with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">killing the parody genre in theaters for a while</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note143liq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note143liq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note143liq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although with the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016">Deadpool</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SausageParty">Sausage Party</a></em> among other titles, the parody genre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRelaunch">seems to have been revived for the big screen to an extent</a>.</span> Their filmography following <em>Vampires Suck</em> takes this further as the duo has now resorted to producing their movies on even tighter budgets than their Hollywood titles, and don't even release them theatrically.
</li><li> Donald G. Jackson isn't called <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood">Ed Wood</a> of the Video Age</em> for nothing.
<ul><li> Don initially planned to produce his first movie, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GfMZPrUwI4">The Demon Lover<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, for $6,000 which was raised by co-director Jerry Younkins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">cutting his own finger off</a> at the auto factory they worked at.

</li><li> For the wrestling documentary <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T3uwu26FlE">I Like to Hurt People<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, Donald initially wanted to follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> during his rise to fame in the industry, but later settled for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheIronSheik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheIronSheik">The Iron Sheik</a> since he was willing to be documented for free. Even then the movie still had to be shelved since Donald couldn't cover the post-production costs, and it remained as such until 1985 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCorman">Roger Corman</a> paid for the process along with the film's distribution rights.

Yes, as in "this movie was made for absolutely no money whatsoever". The cast and crew worked for free, most of the film's special effects were scrapped partway into production, and the creators even saved money by injecting themselves with actual needles filled with saline for a truth serum-centric sequence.

However, the film itself is massively ambitious given that budget, featuring a huge cast, many different locations, several major VFX sequences including a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> rampage through downtown Las Vegas, and a major character portrayed entirely by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a>-style puppetry. Many of the props and sets have a homemade, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>-esque quality to them because after paying the cast and crew, transportation fees, catering and other "normal" costs, there simply wasn't money left to do the "weird" stuff Hollywood-style.
</li><li> <em>Silent Night, Bloody Night</em> was made on a $295,000 budget; a portion of which was provided by Lloyd Kaufman two years before he went on to form <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TromaEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TromaEntertainment">Troma Entertainment</a>.
</li><li> The budget for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeganIsMissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeganIsMissing">Megan Is Missing</a></em> is not known, but it's assumed most of it was spent on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the torture photos and the rape scenes</span>. Hell, numerous production mistakes were left in (for example several scenes have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleBoomMic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleBoomMic">Visible Boom Mic</a> and director Michael Goi can be heard yelling "Action!" during one scene).

<ul><li> This became something of the standard in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Shows</a> after the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_quiz_show_scandals">Quiz Show Scandals<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> broke in 1958 and people became very distrusting of high-reward games. After that, games switched focus from "winning" more to "playing", which resulted in quirkier shows with lower budgets where the focus was more on having fun instead of big payouts. Big-money shows didn't really return until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em> in the late 1990s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlanketyBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlanketyBlank">Blankety Blank</a></em>, the British version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em>, had nearly all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">Undesirable Prizes</a> because they could never afford prizes someone would actually want. This was frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a>; one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> was for second host Les Dawson to claim their prizes were fire-salvaged.
<div class="indent"><strong>Les Dawson:</strong> And for the benefit of anyone who hasn't got an Argos catalogue, here's some of the rubbish you might be saddled with tonight.
</div></li><li> The Taiwanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CashCab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CashCab">Cash Cab</a></em> is so cheap, they deduct the cab fare from contestants' winnings. Early episodes also had extremely paltry prize amounts &#151; the grand total given away on the premiere, after cab fare deductions? Less than US$1.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>: Seasons 37-39 were accused of this, not entirely with the prizes offered but prizes being offered pretty much only as "show" and the pricing games themselves set so hard that, short of a lucky or exceptionally skilled contestant, nobody would win it.
<ul><li> From at least Seasons 29-36 (2000-08) the pricing game win rate was between 46%-50%, with 36 posting the lowest amount of that group. Seasons 37-39 (2008-11) saw the win rate drop noticeably, with 39 in particular putting up just <em>34.9%</em> thanks in part to new game Pay The Rent.
</li><li> While this was a common practice prior to Roger Dobkowitz's departure from the show, it was less criticized because while the games were still set to be more difficult than usual, they could still be won by good contestants because Roger believed in not "cheating" the person who was playing &#151; he refused to put the right choice of That's Too Much in the 1st-2nd or 9th-10th slots, or the money of Half Off in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">Box 13</a>. The subsequent regime ignored both, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> "That's Two Ninth!" in Season 37.
<ul><li> A common example is Stack The Deck, in which the object is to select five out of seven available numbers and use them to form the correct price of the car. The contestant can get up to three free digits by correctly pricing all three grocery products in play. The trope applies if any of the products are set up to be incorrectly priced.
</li></ul></li><li> With the more recent offerings of $20,000+ level trips and very easy pricing game setups (such as Secret X set up for a diagonal win), some have also wondered if trips are even part of the show's budget or if they are furnished by hotels/travel companies.
</li><li> Car games offering compact or subcompact cars often worth less than $20,000 have steadily been on the rise despite inflation. It's gotten to a point where in Season 44, the show seemed to take pride in offering a Nissan Versa worth <em>$12,815</em> in games such as Spelling Bee or Let 'em Roll. Keep in mind, the average price of a new car these days is nearly three times that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury">Sale of the Century</a></em>: The 1980s NBC version originally began with a shopping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>, where contestants could buy sometimes-opulent prizes such as a $25,000 precious commodities package or a $20,000 Oriental rug. The show switched to the Winner's Board in November 1984 and the Winner's Big Money Game in December 1987, dropping the super-expensive prizes in favor of more standard game-show fare in the $1,500-$5,000 range, and moving its car prizes from full-sized Cadillacs and top-end Porsches to mainstream cars such as the Ford Taurus, entry-level luxury cars such as the Mercedes-Benz 190 or BMW 528i, or compact convertibles including the Chevrolet Cavalier (although the occasional Chevrolet Corvette and Cadillac DeVille was offered). Some say this was a cost-cutting move, but contestants could still win more than $70,000 cash ($50,000 as the top prize, plus other cash bonuses along the way) for a successful stay. Still, the big-ticket items, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.veoh.com/watch/v1059457FEX3JAX9">$13,000 European tours and $21,000 cabin cruisers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, were gone.
<ul><li> The Winner's Big Money Game made the $50,000 <em>ridiculously</em> hard to get: the champ had to win the WBMG on their seventh day (to get the car), had to risk it and any preceding WBMG winnings to come back for an eighth day, win that game, then clear the subsequent WBMG to actually get the $50,000. By all indication, only one player won the $50,000 in this format, whereas quite a few won the Lot in the Shopping and Winner's Board eras.
</li><li> The 1980s syndicated version began with the Shopping format, but in November 1985 changed to the Winner's Board as well, played exactly the same way as on NBC. The change was rather noticeable since it was never so much as hinted at until the last segment of the last Shopping episode, when Jim announced it. The fact the Cash Jackpot continued to grow during the final Shopping week, even when it became obvious that nobody would get the $750 needed to win it, didn't help matters.
</li><li> When it was revived as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Temptation2007" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Temptation2007">Temptation: The New Sale Of The Century</a></em>, the budget shrank even further. Prizes were in the $500-$1,000 range, less than 1/4th the typical value of the prizes in the 1980s version if you adjust for inflation. The grand prize was just a mid-range car, worth less than 1/8th the 1980s jackpot (again, adjusted for inflation). Also, Instant Cash started at $500 and grew by $500 per show (with a $5,000 cap) and champs were limited to a maximum of five days. If the shoestring budget had been any tighter, the prizes would've had to be literal shoe strings. Justified as according to host Rossi Morreale <a class="urllink" href="https://sb2tlopg.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/interview-with-rossi-morreale/">in a 2012 interview<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MyNetworkTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MyNetworkTV">MyNetworkTV</a> put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">no money at all into advertising the show.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>: Averted until Season 31. Until then, the show allowed players who finished tied to keep their winnings and play again on the following game. However, the producers circumvented this after four occurrences in Fall 2014: now, all ties are decided with a tiebreaker clue. The winner comes back on the next show with their winnings, while the loser goes home with $2,000. This situation first occurred on March 1, 2018.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/WaitWaitDontTellMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/WaitWaitDontTellMe">Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!</a></em> orginally offered scorekeeper Carl Kasell's voice on the winner's answering machine because the show couldn't afford anything else. The plan was to start offering proper prizes once the show gained a large enough budget but Carl's voice became so coveted that plan was dropped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>, when the daytime version moved from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> in Summer 1989. The show adopted a play-for-cash format (as its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">still-running</a> syndicated companion did in October 1987), but the Wheel's dollar values were slashed, sometimes by more than half, with $50 and $75 dotting the Rounds 1-2 layout and the top value in Rounds 4+ being a very modest $1,250. (Conversely, nighttime used a $1,000/$2,500/$3,500/$5,000 layout {formerly $1,000/$1,000/$5,000} rather than the daytime $500/$500/$1,000/$1,250 {formerly $750/$1,000/$2,000}.) Also, the Bonus Round prizes included $5,000 cash and subcompact/mini-compact cars, as opposed to the $25,000 cash and super-expensive luxury/hand-built/exotic sportscars common in nighttime. Even worse, the price of a vowel dropped from $250 to $200, then further to $100. While the budget improved slightly over the last two years ($50 and $75 were ousted between mid-August and mid-September 1989, and the removal of the Free Spin wedge on October 16, 1989 resulted in a $400 boost), it was still cheap. While the front-game and Bonus Round prizes increased in value as the series went on, the Wheel became static when Free Spin became a token.
<ul><li> Still, despite the comparatively-lower budget, the daytime bonus prizes were generally more practical/desirable game show fare as opposed to nighttime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">"other" prizes</a> such as precious gems, log cabins, trips to private islands, $50,000 silver coffee-and-tea services, rooms full of lavender-colored furniture that didn't fit any average suburban home, and tickets to the year's top sporting events.
</li><li> Subverted in Season 26: The $10,000 Wedge was replaced by the current Million-Dollar Wedge, which only awards the chance of taking it to the Bonus Round, and the contestant must avoid Bankrupt before the game ends. The only envelope that is replaced in the Bonus Round is the $100,000 envelope, with the other 23 left unchanged. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/WheelOfFortune">if the contestant can pull it off...</a>
</li><li> However, with each time the $1,000,000 has been won, the budget has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubvertedTrope">noticeably tighter</a>...despite the fact that said prize has always been insured.
<ul><li> After the first win occurred within a month of the wedge's introduction, the changes introduced in Season 27 made it more difficult to take the wedge to the Bonus Round. The second Bankrupt became permanent throughout the whole game with said space always adjacent to the top dollar amount and the Jackpot Round moved to Round 1, decreasing the value of potential wins.
</li><li> After the second occurred near the end of Season 30, the Bonus Round got much cheaper the following season with the minimum value being landed just over 50% of the time. The $100,000/$1 Million envelope wasn't even landed on until the fourth-to-last week of the season. Also, the cash bonus for winning a car in the Bonus Round decreased from $5,000 to $3,000. Meanwhile, the Jackpot Round was retired, not helped by its high win rate the previous season.
</li><li> Season 32 saw the show making steps to get back on its feet despite the new $32,000 Bonus Round minimum being offered on almost three out of every four shows: the minimum dollar value on the Wheel increased to $500 (but vowels still cost $250), and the cash bonus for winning a car in the Bonus Round also increased back to $5,000. However, all that went out the window with the $1,000,000 being won again just three shows into the season.
</li></ul></li><li> For Season 33, <em>Wheel</em> chose not to tape any road shows, citing high production costs (though the Sony email leaks may have also factored in their decision to do so). Also, two of the Wheel's values decreased with a third being lowered in every round except for one. Furthermore, the show stopped giving cash with cars in the Bonus Round and the 1/2 Car tags were removed for Round 1. Again, it didn't help that the 1/2 Car was won frequently in Season 32.
</li><li> Some would argue that the nighttime version has shown this even before the Million-Dollar Wedge was introduced to the show. The main-game prizes since about 2002 have almost always been trips, cash bonuses, or sponsored shopping sprees (and even then, the trips are usually within the US or Caribbean islands). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> prizes, on the other hand, are limited to cars and cash. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> answers since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> have often been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> answers that are either random pairings of words or contrived phrases that no one would say (although this has been countered somewhat in Season 35 by now allowing the contestant to pick one of three categories).
</li><li> Interestingly, despite signs of budget problems, the Prize Puzzle is still a regular element on the show, currently offering a $7,000+ trip to the player who solves the puzzle. However, they stopped giving out the $50,000 cash award to Sony Rewards card holders in Season 29. In Season 30, they switched to awarding a flat $5,000 to Spin ID members.
</li><li> As of Season 35, SPIN IDs are only put into play when the $10,000 Mystery Wedge is won.
</li><li> The 1/2 Car was retired in Season 37.
</li></ul></li><li> According to a post by Buzzerblog's Alex Davis, the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em> had only $10,000 left in the prize budget for the last episode of its Clock format, suggesting that the Shuffle format was introduced for budget reasons.
<ul><li> The 2018-19 season of the show introduced a new logo and graphics package. However, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/kianworld/status/1039702362217168897">said graphics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are <em>extremely</em> cheap; the question graphics have cheap bevel effects and fonts, the money ladder graphics use a completely different font and are just as ugly, the money graphics after correct answers are a completely different style, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">the "Millionaire" text on the logo isn't even centered!</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em>:
<ul><li> Until 1992, families played for cash. With the introduction of the Bullseye Round, families played for points instead. Plus, the Fast Money prizes of $5,000 or $10,000 depending on the version (which were already cheap by early 90s standards) were replaced with base amounts of $2,500 or $5,000. The 1994 Bankroll version had this even worse, with the most families could play for being either $7,000 or $14,000.
</li><li> It's more blatant on the current syndicated version, which also has families playing for points instead of cash. Its ratings have quadrupled since Steve Harvey became host, but the Fast Money prize of $20,000 remains unchanged since 2001. Fast Money losses are <em>still</em> $5 a point, which has been the same since 1976. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15pmue');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15pmue" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15pmue');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(The Ray Combs-hosted pilots from 1987 offered $10 a point, the only change outside of celebrity shows.)</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCheapShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCheapShow">The Cheap Show</a></em>, a pseudo-game show created by Chris Bearde. The prizes were intentionally cheap (except in the bonus game), the set had a three-person celebrity panel but only two ever showed up, and host Dick Martin was introduced as "the only man we can find who'll work this cheap".
</li><li> The 1981-82 Canadian import <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pitfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pitfall">Pitfall</a></em> originally offered a $5,000 prize package in the bonus game with $100 cash awarded for every "zone" crossed. Later in the run, the prize package was halved and the cash replaced by a small prize for crossing the fourth zone. Later contestants were stiffed of their prizes, and host Alex Trebek's salary check bounced (he has it framed on a wall in his office), all because Catalena Productions, makers of the show, went belly-up.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_(Irish_TV_show)">Quicksilver<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> was an Irish quiz show that ran from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Players competed for laughably small cash prizes, ranging from 2 pence to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">dizzying heights</a> of &pound;10.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inquizition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Inquizition">Inquizition</a></em>, airing from 1998-2001, was by design stripped clean of anything that might imply any sort of a budget. The contestants stood behind podiums that performed the bare minimum of functions&mdash;locking in an answer and showing a score&mdash;and looked it. They competed in an empty sound stage green-screened to look like an abandoned airplane hangar that gave its own implications of cheapness. The prize for winning was a whopping $250, though later on they got really crazy and upped the prize to $500.
</li><li> <em>Letters and Numbers</em>, the Australian version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Countdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Countdown">Countdown (2017)</a></em>, doesn't feature any celebrity guests and the prize for everyone is a Macquarie dictionary whether they lose the first round or win eight in a row.
</li><li> Lampshaded and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with <em>The $1.98 Beauty Show</em>. Contestant competed in a mock beauty pageant and the winner received a plastic crown, a bouquet of rotten vegetables and the titular $1.98 which was dispensed from a change machine on host Rip Taylor's belt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a></em>:
<ul><li> The budget was slashed big time for the final season of the Bergeron version. The change from self-contained to straddling wouldn't have been so bad if the amount for winning wasn't $2,000 tops without any bonus money for each captured square. In contrast, previous games rewarded $500 for each square win or lose and as much as $4,000 for a tic-tac-toe. Also, the Secret Square prizes were no longer rolled over if lost. Every package changed on each show and was roughly the same value.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> got even cheaper.
<ul><li> For the first three of the five levels, contestants originally played for a car, $25,000 and a trip around the world in that order. In the final season, they became the last three prizes with the first two being a sub-$10,000 trip and $10,000. This became even more glaring in light of the original version offering $50,000 for making it to the fourth tier and $100,000 for the champion's fifth and final attempt.
</li><li> To win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> prize, a contestant chose from nine keys with only one opening its contents. At first, bad keys were removed for each failed attempt and for each correct answer in a round where Bergeron quizzed contestants on the featured celebrities. The final season did neither, putting all nine keys in play regardless of the result and offering only consolation cash of $500 (originally $1,000) for each correct answer if lost.
</li></ul></li><li> Its spinoff <em>Hip Hop Squares</em> in its first season offered a top prize of $2,500 in 2012. Could be justified, as it was produced for MTV2, a cable network (plus most of the budget likely went towards getting the celebrities). The VH1 version is quite a bit higher-budget.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em>:
<ul><li> The budget for the main game bonuses got slashed for the John Davidson-hosted revival in 1991. In place of 7-11 (convey seven words or phrases for $1,100), the Tuesday and Thursday shows had two Double Trouble categories (convey seven two-word phrases in 45 seconds, $500 per box). The Mystery 7 (get all seven without the aid of a specific category for a nice prize) was replaced by Gamble for a Trip (decide whether to give up five seconds for the chance to win a cheap trip). Late in the first season, Gamble for a Grand (same as Gamble for a Trip, except $1,000 was at stake) permanently replaced 7-11. Also, this run scrapped the $5,000 bonus for breaking a 21-21 tie.
</li><li> The Donny Osmond version was even worse.
<ul><li> You had to beat the Winner's Circle <em>twice</em> to win $25,000. Previously, if you made it to the Winner's Circle both times, you played for $25,000 regardless of whether or not you won the first time.
</li><li> Winner's Circle categories often consisted of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic Puzzles</a> and impossibly strict judging. The boxes had to be guessed <em>verbatim</em> instead of just "the essence" being said.
</li><li> Hiring celebrities who clearly had no idea how to play the game&#151;or worse, did not speak English as a first language (such as Russian-born Lenny Krayzelburg). This screwed good contestants out of qualifying for the tournament.
</li><li> In the tournament, you <em>also</em> had to beat the Winner's Circle twice in one show to win. If no one succeeded, the contestant whose score was the highest merely <em>had their score augumented</em> to $100,000.
</li></ul></li><li> The GSN revival from 2012 had no main game bonuses.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFiveWordsOrLess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFiveWordsOrLess">25 Words or Less</a></em>: Runner-up contestants receive a $200 debit card for playing.

<ul><li> A common trend with pilot episodes. They tend to be made on extremely limited budgets, with literally no one being paid in the most extreme cases. This often results in a noticeable increase in quality from the second episode on.

It's just one of the many reasons most fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">the books</a> hated it.

When the pilot was made, they were apparently told to "cut every corner" as far as the budget went, and so cut the corners off the paper as a bit of a joke. Of course, once the series was picked up and given rather more of a budget, the paper was subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> and just looks a bit silly. Not to mention a continuity nightmare for the props department.
</li><li> In general, this applied to many shows on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> in the 1960s-80s.

</div><ul><li> While not quite as bad as it was in the seventies, budget constraints occasionally hold the show back even today.
</li><li> The most austere eras for <em>Doctor Who</em> were:
<ul><li> The very first season, where the BBC's unwillingness to risk too much on such an experimental show had caused it to be consigned to a tiny sound stage with minimal props;
</li><li> the first season of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a> era, when the BBC had been stretched by the contemporary updating all of its equipment to the new colour broadcasting standard. That's a reason why the series had The Doctor being in exile on Earth for some time with his TARDIS disabled;
</li><li> the parts of the Tom Baker era produced during the 70s' "stagflation" recession and especially the parts produced during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesCallaghan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesCallaghan">"Winter of Discontent"</a>;
</li><li> the period towards the mid-to-late 80s where the BBC's Controller Michael Grade cut the show's budget to purposefully unsustainable levels in an intent to kill it;
</li><li> the first series of the 2005 revival, due to an initially tiny budget compounded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> not having ever budgeted a science fiction show before and blowing all of the money on the second episode.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> run out of money. The credits were written on scraps of paper, and the heat turned off in the flat they were renting as a studio. The "Mr Neutron Is Missing" episode ends with an announcer saying that the studio ran out of money, so instead of filming the ending, he's just going to tell everyone what would have happened in the final scenes. And then the episode ends before he could finish.
</li><li> Fans of many BBC shows have a common saying that goes similar to "BBC: 15 ACTORS, 8 PROPS, 3 SHOOTING AREAS, AND ONE STORYLINE".
</li><li> This persisted well into the eighties where children's programming was concerned. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcitedKidsShowHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcitedKidsShowHost">Excited Kids' Show Host</a> and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick">Non-Human Sidekick</a> (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">The Voiceless</a>, probably also to keep costs down) would actually have to do their thing in the booth where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityAnnouncement">Continuity Announcements</a> were made, even having to personally press the button to cue up the next cartoon. This booth was nicknamed "The Broom Cupboard", and with good reason (most people old enough to remember this might have been surprised to learn that it wasn't an <em>actual</em> cupboard), which is probably why CBBC's presenters tended not to be <em>quite</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">loud</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">hammy</a> back then; there wasn't space.
</li></ul></li><li> Belgian television is notorious for being very low-budget, which is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">it turns a lot of people off</a>. The highest viewer rating ever seen on Belgian TV however was 1,9 million, so it's not really unexpected. The biggest budget ever put in a Belgian television show was <em>De Kavijaks</em> with 3,35 million dollars. Even so, there are a few cases that stand out.
<ul><li> Maurice De Wilde spent all of the budget he got for his documentaries on research. He still produces spectacular television though if you consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a> to be spectacular. This was intentional however as he did not want to rely on special effects to tell what really happened, which makes all of his documentaries all the more informative.
</li><li> <em>2013</em> is perhaps the only show in television history to be deliberately filmed with amateur cameras. In this case to give the impression that it is all really happening. It works though.
</li></ul></li><li> Public-access television is entirely this, seeing how the shows that broadcast here are produced and aired locally for free. With the rise of the internet during the mid 2000's public-access shows have begun to post their episodes on sites like YouTube following their TV airings.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJcsB9a3Oq8XnAx4udaFPNvG-hC-GdcXK">Sprinkler's Clubhouse<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which airs on Chandler Educational TV on channel 99 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16p0is');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16p0is" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16p0is');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> or at least if you're using Cox cable system </span>, is mostly set against a flat 2D backdrop with low-quality puppets and stock audio; and that's not even getting to the green screen effects.
</li><li> Then there's New York-based talent show <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stairwaytostardom">Stairway to Stardom<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, which The A.V. Club once called "one of the greatest shows ever to be on television."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em> was allocated the same budget by the BBC as the much cheaper cop show it was replacing. The per-episode effects budget, for example, was &pound;50. Expect to see plenty of sets, costumes, and props nicked from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, or perhaps some baking tins stuck on the walls. The special effects designer spent his budget for the <em>entire series</em> on the first episode to be filmed, "Space Fall", because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> was debuting at around the same time. The actual first episode, "The Way Back", went so far over budget it affected the rest of the season &#151; and became one of the best stories in the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops">COPS</a></em>, which is "filmed on-location with the men and women of law enforcement," as it says at the beginning of every show. The show is completely unscripted, mostly because it follows real police officers making routine arrests and talking to people. What little budget there is goes into the cameras and editing.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoubleTheFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoubleTheFist">Double The Fist</a></em> (8 episodes) was made for $250k, which is pretty impressive considering the amount of CGI effects used.
</li><li> The long-extinct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuMont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuMont">DuMont</a> network's programs were produced on low budgets due to their constant troubles as the perennial fourth place network. This resulted in shows with wobbly sets, improvised props (such as the "communicator" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainVideo">Captain Video</a></em> made out of a regular telephone handset) and a soundtrack provided by just an electric organ. To be fair, they often made up for these deficiencies with good writing and excellent actors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEricAndreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEricAndreShow">The Eric Andre Show</a></em> is a parody of low-rent, DIY public access shows. To help make it look authentic, <a class="urllink" href="http://splitsider.com/2012/07/talking-with-eric-andre-kitao-sakurai-and-andrew-barchilon-about-the-eric-andre-show-311-kombucha-and-more/">Adult Swim gave the creators $60 for the first season.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace">Garth Marenghis Darkplace</a></em> suffers from this, being funded mostly out-of-pocket by Marenghi and Dean Learner. This leads to some epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">Special Effect Failures</a> such as a motorcycle chase done on bicycles with engine noised dubbed in. Of course, it's exaggerated considering the actual show does have a small but reasonable budget.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dean Learner</strong>: He had a very ambitious script. I said: "Garth, this is a very ambitious script for the money we've got. Seeing as we've got no money, it's extremely ambitious." We were filming it in my garage. I had a big garage, but still it was ambitious to film a TV show in a garage.
</div></li><li> Parodied in one episode of the Israeli sitcom <em>HaPijamot</em> featuring the same basic premise in various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> scenarios. The last two were &#145;The Story that Would Have Happened if We Had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a>&#146;, featuring the eponymous band replaced by work immigrants from China, and &#145;The Story that Would Have Happened if We Had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a> at All&#146;, in which the apartment they live in was empty.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeadOfTheClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HeadOfTheClass">Head of the Class</a></em> had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> instance: Mr. Moore was directing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors">Little Shop of Horrors</a></em> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">School Play</a>, for which he was given zero budget. He talks the principal into being in the show as Mr. Mushnick, then explains his concept for production. (Quote not guaranteed exact; we couldn't get someone to search it out.)
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Moore</strong>: You heard of Japanese <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh">Noh<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> theatre? No sets, no costumes, no props. Because, you know... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">no money</a>.
</div></li><li> The novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em>, and its sequel, were big sprawling epics, with a few large battles, lots and <em>lots</em> of circuses and gladiatorial games, and the occasional riot. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">TV adaptation</a> manages to stage the whole thing without ever having a crowd larger than a meeting of the Roman Senate. (The battles all occur off-camera, with perhaps an aftermath scene in the general's tent; the gladiatorial games consist of a close-up camera on the Emperor's box.) Hey, the BBC ain't made of money.
</li><li> The pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em> was reportedly shot for $200, but Charlie Day has said they he has no idea where the number came from as there was no actual working budget at all.
<ul><li> In a way the entire first season (and to a lesser extent the second season) were this for the series. The first season had a budget of roughly $400,000 an episode, when Danny Devito joined in season two the budget roughly doubled, and later seasons are closer to $1.5 million an episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow">The Late Late Show</a></em>: Although this is commonly joked about, Craig Ferguson has said in interviews that the reason they rarely do sketches is a lack of money for props. The show only purchased one puppet and got the rest for free from the company who made them, and when the show went to Paris, they couldn't afford to rent a studio (although this resulted in charming scenes of him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell">Kristen Bell</a> wondering around Paris landmarks interviewing guests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkAndTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkAndTalk">on the move</a>). It got a little bit better when Ferguson's new contract with the accompanying new larger studio kicked in, though new no budget items such as the 'fireplace' with a still of a fire keep the show's cheap charm strong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh">The Mighty Boosh</a></em> runs on a notoriously small budget, and as the show progressed the BBC actually cut the budget smaller and smaller as the poor quality of the costumes and sets only served to make the show funnier. During one early episode, Vince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">draws attention</a> to some serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">Special Effect Failure</a> and Howard quips "we spent the budget on your hair".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> started with a tiny budget on its first (KTMA) season, which is what spawned its very homemade-looking props. Subsequent seasons actually had a decent budget, but they had to spend most of it on film rights, so the host segments continued to look very homemade.
</li><li> Early public access producer <em>Paper Tiger Television</em> used any camera they could get ahold of, often shooting shows in both color and black and white. Cameramen would also be shown in shots to show the community aspect of the programming. These shooting techniques were copied endlessly by outfits that did have a budget, including MTV for much of the 1990s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PJKatiesFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PJKatiesFarm">PJ Katie's Farm</a></em> is defined by its utter lack of budget. Everything is done by the eponymous PJ Katie &#151; the characters were literally made by her out of Crayola Model Magic, there are no writers (the scripts are all ad-libbed by PJ Katie), there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices">only one voice actor</a> and she is the same person as the puppeteer. The only other person on set was the cameraman. At one point a danish, which was obviously PJ Katie's lunch, was used as a prop to represent a flying saucer and you can see her eating it during the credits.
</li><li> The two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Super Samurai</a></em> holiday specials <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">"Trickster Treat"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">"Stuck on Christmas"</a> were done last-minute, allegedly due to a previously overlooked contractual obligation with Nickelodeon. With production of the series having already wrapped and the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Power Rangers Megaforce</a></em> set to begin soon, those two episodes were made on a very low budget, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> running rampant. "Stuck on Christmas" mostly averts this by being a mixture of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">Bottle Episode</a> and a clip show; however, "Trickster Treat" was almost entirely made up of stock footage, mostly from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger">Samurai Sentai Shinkenger</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectToVideo">Direct-to-Video</a> movie, unmorphed footage from previous episodes and some from an upcoming episode. Whatever little budget was available was spent on dubbing over the stock footage and editing the episodes.
<ul><li> The original pilot version of the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>, "Day of the Dumpster", was obviously produced on a low budget, with cheaper-looking sets and primitive special effects. In addition, the U.S. footage was shot on videotape rather than on film as with the series, making for a huge contrast between the U.S.-shot footage and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> footage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> was deliberately written and designed to be as cheap as possible <em>before</em> they started scrimping on models (the first Starbug was made out of a discarded lawnmower).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roundhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roundhouse">Roundhouse</a></em> functioned on a very small budget. It used recycled actors, about two boxes' worth of props (mostly cardboard), and two "sets" that were just wheelable walls loaded with random stuff that was probably bought from a garage sale. The only impressive thing they had was their motorized recliner. The simple "improv" look, combined with their humor, singing, and dancing skills, was a good deal of their charm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RutlandWeekendTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RutlandWeekendTelevision">Rutland Weekend Television</a></em> was notorious for this, as they were given a far smaller budget than intended.

<div class="indent"><strong>Host</strong>: Hello, and welcome to <em>Rutland Weekend Television</em>. We've got a really great show lined up for you... not that you can tell, mind you. I mean, for instance... look at this suit. It's <em>rubbish</em>! Feel the quality of that, hm? It's not even theirs! Everything's hired.
</div></li><li> Nearly every show by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidAndMartyKrofftProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidAndMartyKrofftProductions">Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Productions</a></em> was produced on a budget far lower than what the duo would asked from the networks. However these setbacks only added to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">the bizarre and drug-induced charm of their shows</a>, seeing as how they went on to dominate <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17salf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17salf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17salf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for live-action that is</span> the Saturday morning TV market during the late 60s and early 70s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceCases" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceCases">Space Cases</a></em> was a sci-fi show filmed on almost no budget (it was both a cable show and a kid's show, two strikes against it money-wise). Aside from putting CDs on the sides of chairs and handheld video games for control panels, they had the one advantage of being on Nickelodeon: recycling props, most notably from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouAfraidOfTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouAfraidOfTheDark">Are You Afraid of the Dark?</a></em>. Fans tend to agree that this adds to its charm.
</li><li> The early 1970s science-fiction series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStarlost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStarlost">The Starlost</a></em> didn't have much of a budget to begin with, and most of it was blown trying to get a fancy special-effects camera to work. Most of the sets and special effects are terrible as a result.
</li><li> This is among the many things spoofed by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">"Wormhole X-Treme!"</a>. The guy playing Jack O'Neill's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> asks Martin what color the beam from his blaster is. Martin tells him they can't afford a beam; they're just using sound effects.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SuperhumanSamuraiSyberSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SuperhumanSamuraiSyberSquad">Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad</a></em>: Low budget might as well be an excuse for reusing battle scenes with as much regularity as that show did. Also, there were a grand total of five sets (School cafeteria, school hallway, Sam's room, Malcolm's room, newsdesk.) Pretty much anything not in those locations is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenkouChoujinGridman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenkouChoujinGridman">Gridman</a></em> footage, right down to the overwhelmingly-black-haired factory workers and such, if the monster affects the outside world before it impacts anyone we know.
</li><li> Like most shows of the 1930s, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTelevisionGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTelevisionGhost">The Television Ghost</a></em> was filmed extremely cheaply, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast">one actor</a> monologuing at a camera <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOner">for fifteen minutes</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> has episodes where presenters have to buy cars for a very low price, e.g. Porsches below &pound;1500 or vans below &pound;1000.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MANTIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MANTIS">M.A.N.T.I.S.</a></em> didn't have much of a budget and it showed, featuring frequent use of old footage, including footage from the original TV movie and ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the hero and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> killed while trying to stop an invisible dinosaur.</span>

</li><li> The debut self-titled album by My Friend The Chocolate Cake was made on a minuscule budget of $800.
</li><li> Craig Minowa's (and by extension, Cloud Cults) debut album "The Shade Project" was made on a budget so small that he had to cut corners wherever possible and use any and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsAnInstrument" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsAnInstrument">all manner of substitutes for instruments</a>.
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielJohnston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielJohnston">Daniel Johnston</a>'s albums prior to 1990 were recorded from his home without any professional equipment whatsoever. Other than music, Daniel also drew each individual album cover by hand before self-releasing them in his hometown of Austin, Texas. He eventually started signing to professional record labels in the 90s but continues to produce his music and album covers in similar conditions as to his early works.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nickelback">Nickelback</a>'s first EP, <em>Hesher</em>, was recorded in a two month period between January and March of 1993 for $4,000 and was self-released by the group in their hometown. Only a thousand copies of it were made before the band ran out of money <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">and decided the album wasn't worth keeping around</a>, making physical copies heavily sought after by fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> recorded his first song, <em>My Bologna</em>, in the bathroom across the hall from his college's radio station because it wouldn't have costed him anything.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>' first album, <em>Pretty Hate Machine</em>, was solely recorded by front man Trent Reznor who initially began developing the album during down times as an over-night janitor for Right Track Studio.
</li><li> An interesting incident of this befell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NEU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NEU">Neu!</a>!, who ran out of money before they could record what would become side two of their second album, <em>NEU! 2.</em> Their record label refused to give them a dime, so they decided to add the songs from the previously-released standalone single, "Neuschnee/Super," and proceeded to repeat the two tracks at various playback speeds, including one repeat that sounds like a cassette being mangled. Critics dismissed the repetitions and manipulations as a cheap rip-off at the time, but nowadays some look to the result as a forerunner to the remix.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sloan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sloan">Sloan</a>'s debut album <em>Smeared</em> was recorded with only $1200 in 1992 (which now would only be a little more than $1900).
</li><li> Steve Lacy, no not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Jazz Musician,</a> became famous for this.

The rest, as they say, is history.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKGo">OK Go</a> videos, at least at their beginning in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>.

A lot of them feature props bought at the Dollar Store and Ikea.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a> filmed two of her videos, "If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies", back to back, and wound up spending a lion's share of the budget on the former and forcing her to take a minimalist approach with the latter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> artist Sarah Buxton said that the video for her single "Outside My Window" was filmed by one of the song's four songwriters on a budget of $80.
</li><li> The video for Hizaki Grace Project's "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to7geDYUxYs">Philosopher<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" is a good example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> music video where it's painfully obvious that they spent <em>the entire budget</em> on the band members' costumes. The result is a video, apparently shot with a 10-year-old camera (the video was made in <em>2006</em>), which consists almost entirely of the band members performing alternately in front of a wrinkled curtain and on a staircase, interspersed with shots of them posing pensively in various places around the mansion they rented. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumePorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumePorn">But at least they all look gorgeous!</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth">David Lee Roth</a> once bragged that the music video for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>'s "Jump" cost around $600&mdash;at a time when other bands were spending upwards of six figures on their videos. Both the song and video helped make an already popular band <em>HUGE</em>.
</li><li> Voivod's "Ravenous Medicine" is probably one of the cheapest, lamest, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmiest</a> metal video you will ever see, but let's just say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">it makes up for it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff">big time.</a>
</li><li> "Big Bang Baby" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StoneTemplePilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">homage</a> to the bare-bones music videos of the late '70s and early '80s, which already followed this trope. It was made in 1996. You can probably guess how much it must have cost at that point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilDicky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilDicky">Lil Dicky</a> <em>invokes</em> this trope in "Save Dat Money", where he keeps faith to the song's lyrical content by making the most badass rap video possible while not spending anything. Believe it or not, he actually <em>gained</em> money by making the video through sponsorships with the firms he collaborated with.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the video for "Hey Man Now You're Really Living" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eels">Eels</a>. It starts with the singer apologizing for having no money, and then the rest of it is just him and his dog singing along to the song.
</li><li> Anthony Kiedis revealed in his autobiography that the music video for "Jungle Man" was shot on a $200 budget of their own money, comprised solely of footage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> singing the song in clubs, because EMI refused to give them any money for music videos.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/INXS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/INXS">INXS</a> shot their first video, "Just Keep Walking" on a budget of $1200.

Those life-sized puppets? They were created for an unreleased 1999 video, and he just took them out of mothballs. The three-person crew included himself!
</li><li> Every music video by the comedy rock duo <em>Ninja Sex Party</em> was produced with next to no money using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">cheap green screens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation">crudely animated effects</a>, and whatever props and locations they could find at the time.
</li><li> Custom's video for "Hey Mister", directed by the artist himself: The initial concept stemmed from impromptu handheld camera footage revolving around him and his girlfriend going to a beach and writing the lyrics in the sand and on her body. The label liked the results and gave him money to finish the video, so scenes of the two speeding in a yellow Ferrari and shopping, gambling, and dining in Las Vegas were added; However, all of the budget was spent on renting the car and the trip to Vegas. so it was all shot on the same handheld digital camera.
</li><li> The video for O'Hooley and Tidow's version of "Gentleman Jack" (used as the end credit theme for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GentlemanJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GentlemanJack">TV series of the same title</a>) is simply a cellphone video of the two of them messing around in a dressing room in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a> costumes.

Their solution was to turn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestling">Garbage Wrestling</a>, but even in that field they couldn't match the explosives of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW">FMW</a> or production of IWA Japan, inspiring some of their more "distinct" hazards such as "heat stones" (space heaters wrapped in barbed wire) and piranha tanks, which remained even after they could afford better due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a>.
</li><li> Ohio Valley Wrestling's "Shoestring Budget" has been affectionately mocked by everyone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, both of whom expressed disdain with the much more expensive facilities ran by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">revived</a> FCW, believing OVW gets more done with so much less.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW">CZW</a> isn't being rundown for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler">Garbage Wrestling</a> or for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>, other promotions are mocking its non existent budget, the joke usually being after some spectacular mess, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">often their own</a>, someone will decry that even budget less CZW did better.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> was in this situation after losing their distributor, RF Video. While the company was eventually saved by Sinclair Broadcast Group, SBG basically let them run for over a year without a production budget, despite being, well, a broadcast group. ROH in fact threatened to overtake CZW as the punchline, though while production progress was slow, SBG did come to learn the value of talent and venue <em>slightly</em> quicker.
</li><li> Even by independent circuit standards Emi Sakura's Ice Ribbon stood out in this regard as it didn't even have a ring. Shows consisted of children straight from its "dojo" wrestling on mats. With that said, the company has grown immensely from its humble origins to become one of the more recognizable women's feds since the fall of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanWomensProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanWomensProWrestling">Zenjo</a> and GAEA, pioneering internet streaming, bringing pro wrestling to dead venues across Asia and attracting various big name talents, not just from pro wrestling and mixed martial arts but even the unexpected addition of actress Hikaru Shida, who proved to be very good in the ring once they could afford to maintain one.
</li><li> This is the most immediately noticeable difference between Chigusa Nagayo's first promotional effort, GAEA, and her second, Marvelous. Compare the elaborate outfits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LionessAsuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LionessAsuka">Lioness Asuka</a>'s Super Star Unit or Akira Hokuto's Las Cachorras Orientales with Infernal KAORU's W-Fix, who are identified by black t shirts. Still, a promotion run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLegend">Nagayo</a> doesn't have much trouble getting names such as KAORU on its shows or attracting international attention when recruiting new wrestlers. The streaming service was a shakier endeavor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JitterCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JitterCam">sometimes literally</a>, but none the less proved to be a source of good matches.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>'s budget went into a nosedive after they got cancelled from Spike and Panda Energy (the billion dollar company Dixie Carter's parents own) cut them off. By 2016 they were basically broke. They kept on paying their wrestlers and production team late, they were kicked out of their original headquarters and had to move into their merchandise warehouse, and they barely had enough money to do tapings. The annual <em>Slammiversary</em> PPV almost got canceled because they were so short on cash &mdash; it's effectively the reason why Billy Corgan became minority shareholder. And even then Corgan only did so out of ignorance of just how true "no budget" really was and fled to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> once he realized how hard TNA's recovery would be, Anthem of the Fight Network also having an interest in the company giving him a convenient way out.

<ul><li> Happens all the time, mainly because many shows don't really have a budget to begin with. This doesn't apply to, say, Broadway (most of the time), but there are far more theaters out there than what's on Broadway, as well as many colleges that produce productions, and many of them (both college productions and actual theatrical productions,) are run on a shoe-string budget. This can get to the point where all you might have are cheap costumes, a bare-bones set, and minimal lighting. And some productions don't even have that. But in a field where, on average, only 2% of the US go to see shows, it can only be expected, unfortunately.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheFantasticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheFantasticks">The Fantasticks</a></em> spent around $1,000 for set and costuming. This helps keep its production costs low, enabling it to become a record-breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long Runner</a>.
</li><li> An ancient example of the trope - Aristophanes, in his <em>Frogs</em>, has the chorus come on dressed in the filthy torn rags of Bacchic celebrants, and has them joke openly about how this choice of costume helps to keep down the expenses. Athenian theatre was funded by the liturgy system - the compulsory largesse of the wealthiest men in the city - but <em>Frogs</em> was put on at the height of the Peloponnesian War, when everyone was feeling the financial strain and liturgy money was desperately needed to pay for mercenaries and triremes instead. Which makes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.
</li><li> This trope is actually the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">The Scottish Play</a> has such a superstitions reputation, for two connected reasons:
<ul><li> It's one of the cheapest plays you can put together if you can't afford safety equipment &mdash; heck, the fact that most of the scenes are at night means you don't even need many <em>light bulbs</em> &mdash; except it's one of the plays that most <em>needs</em> safety equipment.
</li><li> Because it's so cheap to put on yet such a famous crowd-pleaser, it's a tempting play for a troupe down on their luck to use as their swansong; the play gets blamed for being cursed and putting the troupe out of business, when the troupe was probably already bankrupt by the time the curtains even opened.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Finale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Finale">Finale</a></em> was produced by two high school students. The budget almost entirely came out of pocket and from a (mostly unsuccessful) gofundme page.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo">Katawa Shoujo</a></em> had about 20 international developers and no budget - they all volunteered in their spare time to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames">free game</a>. They didn't even accept any donations, although they have sold some very limited physical goods.
</li><li> This is the reason behind many indie games using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">Retraux</a> graphics rather than being in 3D. 2D pixel art is easy to attempt on your own if you can't afford an artist, although doing it <em>well</em> is another matter, and doesn't require fancy hardware or software.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em> was made by a group of 10 in less than 18 months on a budget of under $1M, leading to the Lego-like art style that's now a series staple. (Yes, it was successful enough for a series). The original also included many large levels, multiplayer, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PlumbersDontWearTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PlumbersDontWearTies">Plumbers Don't Wear Ties</a></em> was very cheaply shot even for a 1990s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo">Full Motion Video</a> game, and most of the time it fails at being full-motion. Low production values are evident even in the game interface (what there is of it, anyway).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptunia">Hyperdimension Neptunia</a></em> had an extremely limited budget, yet garnered the highest amount of sales of any game by Compile Heart, which led it to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">a larger series</a> (with a proper budget, obviously).
<ul><li> This gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> when the main character complains about having to start in a dinky dungeon fighting boring enemies with no cool moves.

</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> had a very limited budget and little promotion, as the project was initially a simple side project by Masahiro Sakurai that Satoru Iwata let him do on weekends. After Sakurai presented the partial product to Iwata, he asked if he could use several Nintendo characters in an effort to make it more original. The game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">surprise success</a> led to the sequels having a much more lavish budget, as seen in the much bigger cast, stage selection, and more complex moves.
</li><li> Almost all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mods</a> rely on a almost non-existent budget and typically are not allowed to sell their finished game/mod for money (Flight simulators are one notable exception). Even total conversion mods like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior Living Legends</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa">Black Mesa</a></em> - mods which are essentially their own triple-A games - are developed on a budget that that only covers the cost for server upkeep and tool licensing, such as 3DS Max.
</li><li> Depending how you look at it, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> is either a straight example or a notable aversion. The studio's annual operating budget is about US$35,000; for a game that's coded by one guy and which started out as a pure hobby project, that's pretty high. For a game that's won a large stack of awards, spawned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">at least three or four imitators</a> from much larger and better-resourced studios, been the subject of a feature article in the New York Times, and been on display in the Museum of Modern Art, it's astonishingly low. Also worth mentioning is that the budget is entirely donations. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreewareGames">The game is entirely free.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFoolsErrand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFoolsErrand">The Fool's Errand</a></em> and its sequel <em>The Fool and His Money</em> were both coded, illustrated, written, and produced entirely by one man named Cliff Johnson. <em>The Fool and His Money</em> in particular was funded entirely by money out of Johnson's own pocket and donations from "True Believers", which goes a long way towards explaining why it took <em>nine years</em> for the game to be completed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Segagaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Segagaga">Segagaga</a></em>: According to developer Tez Okano, the game cost "100th of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue">Shenmue</a></em>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note184ibr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note184ibr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note184ibr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">without adjusting for inflation, that'd be between $470,000 (1/100 of <em>Shenmue</em>'s development costs) and $700,000 (1/100 of both development and marketing costs of <em>Shenmue</em>)</span> and was developed mostly in secret over two years. When its sale was approved, Sega gave him a $200 marketing budget, of which half was used by Okano to buy himself a wrestling mask. Appearing at games stores in disguise, he was able to get enough buzz going to spur online orders and eventually a retail release.
</li><li> The majority of crowd-funded video games (whose title isn't "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCitizen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCitizen">Star Citizen</a></em>") are produced on budgets drastically humbler than what traditional publishers invest into projects of comparable complexity. Since this money is usually spent on programming and assets, crowd-funded projects usually skimp on marketing (compensated by word of mouth) and quality assurance (compensated by a rapid post-release feedback and patch cycle).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfConan">Age of Conan</a></em>. Very apparent when the game first launched in 2008. Most of the world segments were beautifully designed and the storyline and quests were masterful up until level 40, at which point it became obvious to players that the money to develop the game had simply run out. There were practically no quests or playable content between level 40 and level 70 with a smattering of endgame quests filled out. This problem was alleviated by "Rise of the Godslayer" and further expansions that filled out the sorely needed mid level content.
</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaroYoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaroYoko">Taro Yoko</a>'s games fall victim to having to be made with a shoestring budget as well as often having an inexperienced crew under him often leads to lackluster graphics and gameplay. His games often use atmosphere and story in center in order to get by instead.
</li><li> All of the games made by Mediagenic. The reason why is because back then Activision had very little money left, as they wanted to break in the software applications industry under the name Mediagenic, but ended up lacking in success there. That was compounded by an 1988 court decision that found Activision guilty in a multi-million dollar patent infringement suit by Philips regarding its previous cartridge games. They were however still an old and respected name in the video game industry and so were given confident launch titles to last by both Sega and Nintendo for their respective 16-bit consoles. Eventually they crashed, were taken over by an investment group led by Bobby Kotick and filed for chapter 11 reorganisation in 1992 and changed their name back to Activision, which allowed them to do high-budget games once again.

That, or they would publish games from unknown or smaller developers under a very limited budget and severely constrained schedule, often resulting in games like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4gN-k6RXrM">London Cab Challenge<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIbDyHpbWGc">Shoot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the PS1 that were regarded to be some of the worst console titles ever made, if not for its obscurity compared to the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BigRigsOverTheRoadRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BigRigsOverTheRoadRacing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing</a></em>. Their low-budget business model even apparently extended to their advertising, as there is next to no coverage about them in major gaming publications.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotelMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotelMario">Hotel Mario</a></em> and the Zelda games for the Philips CDI are notorious examples in the industry. The Zelda titles were both produced for around $500,000 each, with the infamous animated cut scenes for all three being handled by a small team of amateur animators who were brought into the U.S. to produce them within a five month period. As for games themselves, all three suffered from stiff controls and difficult/confusing game play which wasn't at all helped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">the frequent lags and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">the rather poor and graphically outdated level design</a>; And that's not even mentioning the atrocious writing and voice-overs.
</li><li> The first installment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> was initially a Kickstarter project by creator Scott Cawthon to fund for its creation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">but after failing to attract</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">even a single investor for the game</a>, Scott decided to continue Freddy's development by himself with his own money and even had his kids act as beta testers for it.
<ul><li> On the same subject, Scott's previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Christian and family games</a> were also produced on shoestring budgets as many of them utilized pre-rendered graphics and in-program character models and props.
</li></ul></li><li> Reportedly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomInfinite">Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</a></em> was made on a <em>very</em> low budget for a Modern game with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kanICweLFM">estimates<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> being at least half of the budget for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>'s DLC - you read that correctly, a budget of half not the <em>SFV</em> base game, but that of <em>its DLC seasons</em> - and, as a result, many of the character models were pulled from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em> and other older titles, with only slight changes to make them work in the new artstyle.
</li><li> First <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> game had a modest budget and most of what little development money Remedy had went into creating character models, most of which were based on developers, their friends or family members and people who worked in other companies in the same office complex where Remedy was located to cut down the costs. The distinct Graphic Novel cutscenes of the game were also selected due to budget issues and similarly casted with people that were easily available, most notably the games lead writer, Sam Lake, who played Max Payne.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus">Atlus</a> was undergoing significant financial troubles during the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>. This doesn't show too much during the actual game, but is more evident with the game's choice of platform (it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> game released in 2008) and internal data (the game is built as if it were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, complete with stacks of leftover assets from that game).
</li><li> Compared to the blockbuster-level budgets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RockstarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RockstarGames">Rockstar Games</a> spent on their recent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> titles, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Vice City</a></em> in particular was developed on a $5 million budget. Most of it was apparently spent on the voice actors, namely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayLiotta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayLiotta">Ray Liotta</a> and a few others. Given how the game was initially conceived as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em> before it was spun off as a standalone game it isn't that much of a surprise, though ironically enough it was actually their <em>most expensive</em> game up to that point.

</li><li> Much like how an episode of an Japanese production costs less than an episode of a western one, the latter is made with a considerably smaller amount of money than an animated film.
</li><li> Many studios that opened up during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfAnimation">the first 15 years of commercial TV</a> churned out many cartoon shows with the most threadbare of budgets. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> has been widely chided for this practice during its tenure from 1957 to 2001.

Compare that to the last <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> shorts Bill and Joe made for MGM a couple years earlier, which had budgets close to $60,000! In this case, <em>Ruff and Reddy</em> (1957-1960) was the very first television series produced by the new company, and it is quite likely they did not have the funding for anything more ambitious. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuckleberryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuckleberryHound">Huckleberry Hound</a></em> (1958-1961) didn't fare much better with its meager budget of $6,000 per short.
</li></ul></li><li> Sam Singer, who's often referred to as "The Ed Wood of Animation", produced what many consider some of the cheapest cartoons ever made from the 50's and 70's through his studio Trans-Artist Productions.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfPaddyThePelican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfPaddyThePelican">The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican</a></em> resorted to looping uncolored cut-outs and rough animation which were frequently out-of-sync in each episode. Not to mention that sound effects are largely absent with the exception of some atrociously improvised voice acting and music, all of which were provided by Singer himself!
</li><li> His final cartoon, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TubbyTheTuba1975" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TubbyTheTuba1975">Tubby the Tuba (1975)</a></em>, was produced and developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticOnlyCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticOnlyCartoon">in-house</a> by The New York Institute of Technology under the direction of founder Alexander Schure, who had no experience in animation prior to this film. Singer was hired as the animation director for the movie but was fired a year into production due to Schure's frequent intrusions. After negative feedback from test audiences, Singer chose to have his name removed from the final cut.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation">Filmation</a> was notorious for making all of their series with absolutely no budget whatsoever. This was due in part to their policy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticOnlyCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticOnlyCartoon">never outsourcing animation jobs</a>, which was expensive. In fact, when the studio first started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the co-founders had to use a mannequin to pass off as a secretary</a>!

</li><li> Any films by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton">Bill Plympton</a>, who maintains that his budget is about $1,000 per minute of animation, which is very low by the industry standards. In addition to doing most of the work himself (with only a small number of crew helping out), he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation">animates in threes</a>, giving his animation a choppy look that became his signature style.

Due to the poor animation brought back from China they spent the final four months redoing the film by teaching themselves CG animation using homemade render farms. One member said the final product was the result of executives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy">being more concerned about the film's completion during the silly band craze rather than the overall quality</a>.

It also helps that he began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">using computers</a> in his later shorts.

To further limit costs, Jack Mercer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">had to voice every character in one take</a> while enunciating his lines slowly to put less strain on the animators. Worse, they had to turn out three completed episodes per week with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">mere hours to write the scripts for each one</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23ejwt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note23ejwt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23ejwt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> One animator was cranking out 150 feet&mdash;or close to two minutes worth of animation each week just to get the episodes done! </span> John Canemaker's Felix book summed up just how frugal Joe Oriolo was forced to be on the show;
<div class="indent">&#147;One of his dictums became well known within the industry: scenes that could not fit under his office door, said Oriolo, held too many drawings.&#148;

The company that originally produced the show declared insolvency during production, causing it to have to resort to Adobe Flash-quality animation.

The limited budget also affected casting as the crew also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendedCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendedCreator">had to voice almost every character in the show</a> save for three additional voice actors; one of whom was hired because she was willing to do it for free.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PickleAndPeanut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PickleAndPeanut">Pickle and Peanut</a></em> was definitely made on a low budget.

</li><li> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> cartoon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlaneCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlaneCrazy">Plane Crazy</a>, was an independent short made after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> had lost the rights to his character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OswaldTheLuckyRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OswaldTheLuckyRabbit">Oswald the Lucky Rabbit</a>.

</li><li> The Al Brodax <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Popeye">Popeye</a> cartoons had similar budget problems. They were farmed out to every studio across the planet, slamming together around 200 made for TV cartoons in just two years.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>'s minimalist geometric art style (originally spawned from cardboard cut-outs), casting (almost all the voices are done by creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> and a pair of female voice actors) and use stock effects allows episodes to be done by a small team of under 20 people assuming multiple roles, <em>all within the course of a single week</em>.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em>South Park</em> Trey and Matt were given $1,000 to make the Christmas short that later became a basis for the show. Of that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">they spent $750 on actual production, with them pocketing the rest.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Almost anything produced for <em>Spike and Mike's Animation Festival</em>.
</li><li> MTV's first animated series, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo19qujXbnE">Stevie and Zoya<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, was noted for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation">its extremely crude animation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">and soundtrack made up of old movie and television scores</a>. The title characters had next to no dialogue throughout its run and when they did speak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">it was usually a flub left in the final cut</a>, giving the show an improvised feel. Despite this, the show quickly achieved a cult status among viewers due to its fast pace and short running time. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24tutm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24tutm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24tutm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">1-2 minutes per episode</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomTerrific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomTerrific">Tom Terrific</a> is probably as low-budget as a presentable TV cartoon can get; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryToons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryToons">Terry Toons</a> had very little money for it, so as a cost-cutting measure the animation consisted of black line-art only, with no cel paint used (at least in the first season; in the second season they started painting the characters solid white).
</li><li> Nearly every cartoon ever produced by William Street falls under this.
<ul><li> The studio's first show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast">Space Ghost Coast to Coast</a></em>, was almost entirely comprised of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">stock footage</a> of the original cartoon by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> that was animated using After Effects<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25705i');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25705i" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25705i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">an editing program no less</a></span>. On the plus side this added to the show's idiosyncratic humor and nature which helped to kick start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> a few years later.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwelveOunceMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwelveOunceMouse">12 oz. Mouse</a></em>. All the characters resemble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSPaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSPaint">MS Paint</a> drawings, and there are few effects. The creator joked it would "cost five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier".
</li></ul></li><li> The voice cast for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesClues">Blue's Clues</a></em> was mostly made up of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendedCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendedCreator">crew and co-creator</a> because of the limited casting budget they had to work with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClutchCargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClutchCargo">Clutch Cargo</a></em> barely qualifies as a cartoon since Cambria Studios had to produce each episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">with one-fifth of what it would cost Hanna-Barbera to make</a>. To get around this, animators had to superimpose the lips of the actors onto their characters and substitute actual animation with real time movement.
<ul><li> Speaking of Cambria Studios, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">they were also the producers of such classics</a> like <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwzcI6t_AQ">Space Angel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> and <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSiNE8kk3QM">Captain Fathom<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> which aren't any different in quality from Clutch. If Sam Singer was the Ed Wood of animation during the 50's, than Cambria co-founder Clark Haas was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColemanFrancis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColemanFrancis">Coleman Francis</a> of that decade.
</li></ul></li><li> 2009's <em>Dixie Dynamite</em> clearly had no budget considering the stiff animation and poorly-rendered CG backdrops. Did we mention that one of the film's animators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">also worked on Rapsittie Street Kids</a>?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticOnlyCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticOnlyCartoon">Domestically-produced cartoons</a> inverts this rule, as it's much cheaper to outsource animation to another country than to produce it locally because of the difference in dollar values. As a result, domestically-animated projects tend to have lower production values than outsourced ones despite having the same budget, since producers have to pay more for local animators than for animators in Japan or South Korea.
</li><li> Spoofed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> episode "The Discount of Monte Cristo", where Aloysius keeps on making random budget cuts to the story so that it's done as cheaply as possible, going from cutting a musical number, firing actors, reusing the same sets and eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turning the background black and white and having Roy and Wade double as actors</span>, making Orson annoyed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CliffordTheBigRedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CliffordTheBigRedDog">Clifford the Big Red Dog</a></em> was pretty obviously made on a low budget, as if the heavy usage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">Talking to Himself</a> for the voice actors, with some exceptions such as John Ritter as the titular character, and the music score, which is comprised solely of synthesizers and an emulated clavinet, wasn't a big enough hint.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other&nbsp;</div><div id="folder17" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMockbuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMockbuster">Mockbusters</a>.
</li><li> There are a wide variety of such competitions, generally along the lines of "Here's a camera, here's 24/48 hours, make a movie!" A disproportionate number of them are named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood">Ed Wood</a>.
</li><li> Multimedia students at universities can rent cameras for free, but that's it; everything else is down to them. Students being students, your actors are likely not to turn up, and your "props" will be whatever your roommates have lying around. Having someone in the group who is good with editing and special effects can help disguise the fact that the movie consists of you and your aunt acting in the woods behind the main campus. It's even worse for independent filmmakers: they don't even give you the camera.
</li><li> Nowadays, good quality audio recording is easy and cheap. Even integrated sound cards have much better audio quality than old recording equipment. You don't have to use Apple computers; regular Windows and Linux PCs are fine too. If you buy a cheap professional sound card, it's unlikely to not include some recording software (and even if it does not, there's always Audacity and other free alternatives). VSTs can be obtained for free (either as freeware or pirated) and several alternatives exist for GarageBand on Windows and Linux. The only problem is to get instruments, microphones and talent, and even the first two can be done cheap or skipped entirely depending on what you aim for musically and where you look.
</li><li> As for video recording, many cameras today can record in HD; even your cellphone can likely do 16x9 HD in landscape mode. As above, talent is the thing to find, as well as ingenuity to compensate for the lack of budget.
</li><li> The Artega GT was a sports car that had cost a bit over $10 million to develop, while competitor ones usually cost at least 20 times more. Despite the low budget, it was designed by the famed Henrik Fisker.
</li><li> Many TV-based animated features owe their success on the fact that they're produced on relatively smaller, modest budgets as opposed to the high price tags any major Hollywood animated film is made for.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASMRVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASMRVideo">ASMR Video</a> can have this - the use of household items or just narration over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a> as a trigger.
