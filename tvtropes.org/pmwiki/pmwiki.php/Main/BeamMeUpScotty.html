One of the films got pretty close, but even then, it was phrased: "Scotty, beam me up."

The actual phrase comes from a famous <em>Star Trek</em> bumper sticker - "Beam me up, Scotty, there's no intelligent life on this planet."

Very rarely was this Scotty himself, who was the <em>chief engineer,</em> meaning <em>no</em> version of the command was said to him with any regularity.

<ul><li> While it's certainly the message he wanted to convey, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YulBrynner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YulBrynner">Yul Brynner</a> did not say the exact phrase "I'm dead. Don't smoke," in his posthumous anti-smoking ad.
</li><li> Meta-example: an ad for a cable company shows a movie-loving family communicating entirely in movie quotes. They must be phonies or trying to avoid copyright issues, though, because most of the quotes are Beam Me Up Scotties.
</li><li> It's a crude example, but the commercial never said, "I'm Mr. Bucket. Put your balls in my mouth." It did come very close a few times, though. What it actually says in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEWQRr6T-_g">this commercial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is 'Put your balls in my top, I'm Mr Bucket, out of my mouth they will pop'.
</li><li> The infamous ads for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evony">Evony</a></em> do not include the phrase "Play now, my lord!" It's actually "Start your journey now, my lord" or "Come play, my lord".
</li><li> Mikey, the kid from the Life cereal commercials in the 1970s and '80s, will not "eat anything" despite the phrase being remembered as "Let's give it to Mikey, he'll eat anything!" In the commercial, the two boys opt to give their Life cereal (which must taste awful, seeing as their parents say it's "good for them") to their little brother Mikey. One of the brothers disagrees, saying, "He won't eat it. He hates everything." But, surprise: "He likes it! Hey, Mikey!" When you think about it, giving the kid who would "eat anything" their cereal would prove nothing about whether the cereal tastes good.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in a 2008 commercial for the jewelry store Jared. A man's car navigation system starts acting like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">HAL</a>, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a69eC7ldAcI">gets the famous quote right.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<div class="indent">"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
</div></li><li> The famous 1987 anti-drug PSA never actually said, "This is your brain... this is your brain on drugs." There were two versions, long and short. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub_a2t0ZfTs">The long version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> started with the camera on John Roselius saying "Is there anyone out there who still isn't clear about what doing drugs does? OK, last time." Picks up an egg, "this is your brain", points to the skillet, "this is drugs," cracks egg and holds up skillet, "this is your brain on drugs. Any questions?" <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FtNm9CgA6U">The short version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was a hot skillet sizzling with oil, waiting on the stove accompanied by psychedelic sound effect &mdash; while a voiceover said, "OK, last time. This is drugs," indicating the skillet, not the egg. Then an egg broke open into the skillet and immediately began frying. Cue the voiceover, "This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07ctj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note07ctj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07ctj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An even shorter version skipped the "OK, last time" part.</span>
</li><li> There have been many spoofs of Ed McMahon telling people that they've won the Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes. Ed actually advertised for short-lived rival American Family Publishers.
</li><li> The famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">Digital Piracy Is Evil</a> PSA does not state "You Wouldn't Download a Car". It instead tells the viewer that "You Wouldn't <em>Steal</em> a Car", probably because people absolutely <em>would</em> download a car.
</li><li> Many people think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> signs that boast X billion hamburgers sold. While some of the oldest signs did say that, the signs installed after about 1970 actually read "Over X Billion <em>Served</em>". Not only does this allow them to include complimentary burgers, "served" just sounds friendlier than "sold". By the mid-80s, new signs switched to the generic "Billions and Billions", then did away with the count at some point in the '90s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrookeShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrookeShields">Brooke Shields</a> never said, "Nothing comes between me and my Calvins." She actually said, "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing."
</li><li> Frank Gari-penned jingle "Turn to 3", written for Cleveland&#146;s TV station WKYC, is often misquoted as "Turn to a friend, turn to 3," but the jingle&#146;s closing lyrics are actually "You&#146;ve got a friend, turn to 3." WKYC&#146;s slogan prior to "Turn to 3" was "At Channel 3, You&#146;ve Got a Friend," also by Gari.
</li><li> British Airways' slogan used by the airline between 1974 and 1983 was "We'll take more care of you," not "We'll take good care of you."

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Air" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Air">Air</a></em>, Misuzu never says "Goal".

</li><li> Nowhere in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>, especially not the Streamline dub, does Kaneda ever tell Tetsuo, "No way! You're just a kid! Maybe when you're older!" The Streamline dub does come close in the scene most often associated with that line, and even then it's "Yeah, yeah! Don't make me laugh! Maybe when you've downed your first clown!" That said, Kaneda does treat Tetsuo rather condescendingly as a kid. The quote "No way! You're just a kid!

</li><li> Dio's memetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combos">combo</a> is often thought to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarehandedBladeBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarehandedBladeBlock">Barehanded Blade Block</a> -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs">MUDADA</a> -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">ZA WARUDO</a> -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm">Flechette Storm</a> -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnvilOnHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnvilOnHead">ROADROLLADA</a> -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kiai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kiai">WRYYY</a>. However, this really owes itself to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">fan-made flash animation</a>, not either the manga or the game.
</li><li> Dio's time stand still move is never called ZA WARUDO. It is merely named Time Stop, and the Stand's name is The World. It is never implied to be spelled in broken English too. Complicating this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jotaro's time stop move</span> is called "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star Platinum's</span> The World."
</li><li> Also attributed to Dio is the line commonly transcribed as "toki wo tomare" (&#26178;&#12434;&#27490;&#12414;&#12428;), usually translated as "Time stops!". This is grammatical nonsense that is perhaps more accurately translated to English as "To be able to stop time ...". The actual line is "toki <strong>yo</strong> tomare" (&#26178;&#12424;&#27490;&#12414;&#12428;), which sets time as the "person" being addressed (like calling somebody's name), and commands it to stop - succinctly, "Time - stop!". The origin of this mix-up is likely a simple mishearing, reinforced by some (but incomplete) knowledge of Japanese grammar; the "wo" is a common particle, so a novice speaker might think that it makes more sense than the uncommon, somewhat archaic, and not-classroom-friendly "yo" (which, admittedly, is difficult to aurally distinguish in this case unless one is aware of the grammar behind it).
</li><li> The series' reputation as being full of dramatic posing comes mainly from the Capcom game. While there's plenty of posing in the manga, it isn't as common or as elaborate as one might think. In fact, some of the most iconic "JoJo Poses," including Dio's pelvic thrust, were made up entirely for the game and don't happen in the manga.
</li><li> Although the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Duwang"</a> scanlation of the <em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em> manga did produce countless funny lines, "I am the fucking strong!" is not one of them. That's actually from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>.
</li><li> A phrase often associated with the series is "This must be the work of an enemy Stand". This was never said in the series. The only thing close was in chapter 321 of <em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em>, where Koichi says, "This has to be the work of an enemy Stand user".

However, in this intro, and most of the time in the show, Dedede actually pronounces "Kirby" correctly, though the person singing the theme song pronounces it "Kirbeh" once or twice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> fanfiction, Vita is attributed surprisingly often with coining Nanoha's nickname "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">White Devil</a>". Firstly, what Vita <em>did</em> was call Nanoha a (not white) devil in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellAreYou">What the Hell Are You?</a> moment, and secondly, Nanoha is not <em>ever</em> referred to as the White Devil in the series proper.

Tobi says that a lot there, and it's been on for a few years. It could also be attributed to the manga chapter coming out a couple years before the anime clears up who actually said the line.
</li><li> Sasuke is commonly attributed with telling Sakura: "You're weak/useless." But actually he never said that. The closest comes when she asks him if they can go work on their teamwork, "just the two of us." And he responds with, "I swear, you're just as bad as Naruto. Instead of flirting, why don't you practice your jutsu and make the team stronger? Let's face it, you're actually worse than Naruto."

Gendo simply points out to his son the reasons for why he should pilot the Eva 01, and even then he doesn't insist or gets violent on him about it; he tells him that if he won't do it, then he should leave. Another reason why he wouldn't utter the phrase is that, well, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Evas are not really robots</span>.
</li><li> The memetic phrase "Pilot the Eva, Shinji, or Rei will have to do it again" and its snowballing parodies through a lot of franchises, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElChavoDelOcho">El Chavo del ocho</a></em>, was never said by any character.

The "Go" came from the fact that in Japanese, names for vehicles (including ships) are given the honorific "go", so the characters would refer to the ship as "Merry-go", similar to calling Luffy "Luffy-kun". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em> are to be blamed for this confusion, since they translated the ship's name as Merry Go, mistaking the "Go" as actually part of its name rather than just an honorific.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> never said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> were "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus">Bigger Than Jesus</a>," it was:
<div class="indent">"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're <strong>more popular than Jesus</strong> now - I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right, but His disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."
</div><ul><li> It also must be pointed out that contrary to massively popular belief the above quote was not a boast but lament. If there was any mockery intended then it was not toward Jesus or Christianity but toward the people he was complaining about, who were letting their fandom get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">ludicrously out of hand</a>.
</li><li> This was printed in a London <em>Evening Standard</em> interview, "How does a Beatle live?" in March 1966, talking about John's extensive reading of philosophers and historians. The decline of organized religion had been a subject for serious philosophical discussion in England and Europe for decades, and UK readers understood Lennon's remarks to refer to this. The quote was ripped out of context on purpose by the <em>American</em> press for a smear piece and has almost invariably been viewed that way ever since, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">whereas the full context makes the meaning quite clear</a>.
</li><li> John never said, "[Ringo] isn't even the best drummer in The Beatles!" The line originated in a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/beatles/did-john-lennon-say-ringo-wasnt-even-best-drummer/">sketch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a> Radio 4 comedy series <em>Radio Active</em> which aired in 1981, a year after Lennon was murdered. That it even got pinned on Lennon to begin with is a little odd, since it implies the very unrealistic idea that John thought Paul was a better drummer than Ringo. To the contrary, Lennon regularly praised Starr's drumming, and asked him to play on his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennonPlasticOnoBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennonPlasticOnoBand">John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</a></em> album in 1970.

<div class="indent">Nearly seven hours into the concert in London, Bob Geldof enquired how much money had been raised; he was told &pound;1.2 million. He is said to have been sorely disappointed by the amount and marched to the BBC commentary position. Pumped up further by a performance by Queen that he later called "absolutely amazing", Geldof gave an infamous interview. David Hepworth, conducting the interview, had attempted to provide a list of addresses to which donations should be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted: "<strong>Fuck the address, let's get the numbers!</strong>" After the outburst, giving increased to &pound;18,000 per minute.

One of the best videos of all time!
</div></li><li> The anthem for the US Navy, <em>Anchors Aweigh</em>, is sometimes quoted as having the line "we sail at the break of day", but the actual line goes "we sail at break of day" (no "the" before "break"). And, of course, thanks to the lovely world of homonyms, the title tends to be misspelled as "away", not the correct "aweigh".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Bj&ouml;rk</a> never said "I am <strong>a</strong> grateful grapefruit!" at <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/rSs7JnTxVo8?t=2m49s">the 1998 Brit Awards<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It was actually "I...am...grate...ful...grape...fruit!" Which is perfectly sensible.
</li><li> People are still quoting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> as saying, "The only thing negroes can do for me is shine my shoes and buy my records", although there is absolutely no evidence of his ever uttering this, and in fact everyone who ever worked closely with Presley commented on his total lack of prejudice. Much of the blame for perpetuation of this misquote lies with its use in Albert Goldman's negative biography, <em>Elvis</em>. Sadly, he <em>did</em> make an insulting remark about his black backup singers' breath smelling like catfish at a concert in Norfolk, Virginia, in July 1975. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/presley3.asp">This has been attributed to his out-of-control drug use at the time<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">I'm Rick James</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch">bitch</a>!" was made up by Dave Chappelle for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> sketch spoofing Rick James' life, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a> cast member Charlie Murphy tells. So naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeltzerAndFriedberg">Seltzer and Friedberg</a> didn't realize that while making <em>Epic Movie</em>. The only time Rick James actually did say it was at the 2004 BET Awards, though this was after the Dave Chappelle sketch, and was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">reference to it</a>.
</li><li> "Dave's not here man", a line often associated with stoners, came from a sketch off a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong">Cheech and Chong</a></em> album, but 'man' is never said in that line. That doesn't stop people from misquoting it though, this is mostly due to the duo's liberal use of the word.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> references a common use of this trope in his song "Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me": "And by the way, your quotes from 'George Carlin' aren't really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">George Carlin</a>..."
</li><li> The song that in which "Figaro" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">repeatedly sings</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmSong">his name</a> comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBarberOfSeville">The Barber of Seville</a></em> by Rossini. Some people, however, don't realize that more than one opera features the character of Figaro, and will perceive it as being from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMarriageOfFigaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMarriageOfFigaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a></em> - by Mozart.
</li><li> One popular Christmas carol is invariably called <em>God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen</em> &mdash; but the correct title is actually <em>God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen</em>. God is commanding gentlemen to be merry; he isn't commanding those who are already being merry to knock it off. One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/CabinPressure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/CabinPressure">Cabin Pressure</a></em> involves a debate on this very subject, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">one character</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">mishearing the lyric</a> as "Get dressed, ye merry gentlemen." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> also misquotes it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> as "God bless you, merry gentlemen."
</li><li> In 1976, KSAN free-form radio DJ Terry McGovern recorded a cheery ballad called "Beam Me Up, Scotty" (Baseball Records BR-1011). It received plenty of airplay on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento">Dr. Demento</a> show and appears on the compilation album <em>Dr. Demento's Hits from Outer Space.</em> This recording probably did a great deal to popularize the phrase. Mc Govern also published <em>Listen to the Loud</em>, a parody of Rod Mc Kuen's work.
</li><li> The second line of the song "Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner" is usually misquoted as "That I love London Town", but that's actually the <em>last</em> line. The correct second line is actually "That I love London so", in order to rhyme with the fourth line, which ends "go".
</li><li> The music video for The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VillagePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VillagePeople">Village People</a>'s "YMCA" doesn't include any of the famous "letters" dance associated with it. The dance originated with live audiences, not the group themselves, though they noticed how well it was catching on and subsequently decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a> to their performances.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MotherGooseAndGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MotherGooseAndGrimm">Mother Goose and Grimm</a></em> comic strip parodying Simon and Garfunkel has Paul Simon singing: "Well hello, Mrs. Robinson." That line is never heard in the song.
</li><li> The last song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMikado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMikado">The Mikado</a></em> has the refrain "There are lots of good fish in the sea." This is frequently misquoted as "plenty of fish in the sea".
</li><li> "The End" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors">The Doors</a> is famous for many lyrics, one in particular being <em>"Father, yes son/I want to kill you/Mother, I want to fuck you"</em>. That isn't the original line, and is only known and accepted by most as the official line because of the popular live version where Jim sings that line. In the studio version, Jim sings, "Mother, I wanna..." then suddenly screams a bunch of unintelligible nonsense.
</li><li> People who have never listened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> but who have watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> probably think the infamous "YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!" comes at the start of "Won't Get Fooled Again". In fact, the song is 8:32, and the "YEEEEEEEEEAAAAHHH" comes in around 7:45. And there is buildup to it; it doesn't happen suddenly.
</li><li> Due to the "MLG Montage Parody" internet phenomenon, the line "Smoke weed everyday" is heavily associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg">Snoop Dogg</a>. While Snoop is a well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">stoner</a>, it was actually sung by his similarly-named cousin, fellow rapper and singer Nate Dogg, and the line was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> of the song "The Next Episode", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre">Dr. Dre</a> song featuring both cousins.
</li><li> In the 1935 jazz standard "The Music Goes Round and Round", written by Ed Farley and Mike Riley, the lyrics actually say "the music goes <em>down</em> and around." They're describing how a saxophone works. An instant hit and notoriously catchy, one reviewer described this as "the conversion of a song hit into a plague, like Japanese beetles or chain letters."
</li><li> The title of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> song "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" is an example of this. The song was named after a phrase that two unknown attackers repeatedly screamed at former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> Evening News</em> news anchor Dan Rather as they assaulted him. However, according to Rather himself, what the attackers (one of whom was later revealed to be William Tager, who thought the media were beaming signals into his mind and that if he found the right frequency he could block the signals) actually said was "Kenneth, what is the frequency?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">And being that Tager was Jewish, it's possible he was actually saying "goniff", Yiddish for "thief", rather than "Kenneth".</a>
</li><li> The end of verse two of The Rays' "Silhouettes" goes "Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade." Everyone who has done a cover of it performs it as "Wondered why I'm not the guy, two silhouettes on the shade" simply because it matches the end of the other verses (or they thought that's how the verse actually was affected).
</li><li> Sergio Mendez and Brazil '66's cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' "The Fool on the Hill" has often been mistaken as the theme of the late '60s ABC dramedy <em>Room 222</em>, as it has a semi-similar arrangement.
</li><li> The lyric "<em>You&#146;ve got to sing like you don't need the money / Love like you'll never get hurt / You've got to dance like nobody&#146;s watchin' / It's gotta come from the heart if you want it to work</em>" is frequently both misquoted and misattributed, with popular targets including Satchel Paige and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>. It originates in the country song "Come from the Heart", written by Richard Leigh and Susanna Clark in 1989, and recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams">Don Williams</a> and then by Guy Clark (Susanna's husband) before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">the most famous version</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KathyMattea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KathyMattea">Kathy Mattea</a> was released in 1989.
</li><li> One particular line in the chorus of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast">Outkast</a> song "Ms. Jackson" is often remembered as "I apologize a thousand times". In actuality, it's "I apologize a <em>trillion</em> times".
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">Mondegreen</a>, the song "California Dreaming" by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMamasAndThePapas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMamasAndThePapas">The Mamas &amp; the Papas</a></em> has a line that's often thought to say "I got down on my knees, and I began to pray". It's actually the (somewhat ungrammatical) "I got down on my knees, and I <em>pretend</em> to pray", which may sound odd, but it fits the next line: "preacher likes the cold, knows I'm gonna stay" (i.e people keep coming into the church to get out of the cold.)

</li><li> Howard Cosell is often quoted as saying "Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning" in reaction to an aerial shot of a five alarm fire in the Bronx during Game 2 of the 1977 World Series.

</li><li> Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi never said, "Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing". The quote was actually from UCLA Bruins football coach Red Sanders. What Lombardi actually said was "Winning isn't everything. The will to win is the only thing." He often claimed he was misquoted.
</li><li> The phrase "The frozen tundra of Lambeau Field" was never spoken by NFL Films narrator John Facenda; it comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a> commentator Chris Berman's imitation of him.

And where are they? In seventh place!" (which was actually second-to-last in the league that year). Later reports changed this to the punchier "nice guys don't win pennants", which then evolved into the familiar form.

<ul><li> There are a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespearean</a> examples of this:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lady Macbeth never actually says <em>Out, out damn spot!</em>. Macbeth does say "Out, out, brief candle!", which is probably where the confusion stems from. Lady Macbeth's line was actually "Out, damned spot!", with only one "out", and "damned", not "damn".
</li><li> Macbeth's line when he hallucinates the dagger is often quoted as "Is this a dagger I see before me?" However, Macbeth actually says, "Is this a dagger <strong>which</strong> I see before me, the handle toward my hand?"
</li><li> "Double, double toil and trouble", not "Bubble bubble" <em>or</em> "Hubble, bubble". If nothing else, they rhyme it with "bubble" in the next line, so it'd be a pretty lazy rhyme. Also, they used toe of <em>frog</em> not toad. Though they threw a <em>whole</em> toad in there too.
</li><li> "Lead on, Macduff", which is a common misquotation of "Lay on, Macduff", often used in a completely different context from how it is used in the play.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12uzfl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12uzfl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12uzfl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Fiorello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Fiorello">Fiorello!</a></em> makes one character's last name "Macduff" for no better reason than to use the misquotation.</span> Macbeth is challenging Macduff to attack him in the final scene, threatening that it will be no holds barred. Macduff then fights Macbeth, killing him off-stage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>:
<ul><li> Queen Gertrude never said "Methinks the lady doth protest too much"; it was actually "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." Which isn't terribly different but is certainly drier. Note that the line means something mostly different than what people think it means ("protest" means "promise", not "speak against" or "complain".)
</li><li> Although Hamlet undoubtedly "knew him well", he never said so of Yorick in so many words:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Hamlet:</strong> Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it.
</div><ul><li> Polonius is often quoted as saying, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be, but to thine own self be true." That quote comes from two different sentences in the scene where he is giving advice to Laertes.
</li><li> Horatio says, "Good-night, sweet prince; And <strong>flights of angels</strong> sing thee to thy rest", not "a flight of angels".
</li><li> The phrase "This is a tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind" is nowhere to be found in Shakespeare's play, only in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceOlivier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceOlivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s 1948 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hamlet1948" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hamlet1948">film version</a>.
</li><li> What are Hamlet's two iconic scenes? The "To be or not to be" monologue and the "Alas, poor Yorick" scene where he's holding the defunct jester's skull. Some depictions of the play show Hamlet saying the former line, skull in hand.
</li></ul></li><li> Prospero from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em> has a line that is frequently misquoted as "the stuff that dreams are made of." He is actually talking about the transience of human life, and the line goes: "We are such stuff / As dreams are made on, and our little life / Is rounded with a sleep."
</li><li> More a misunderstanding than a misquote, but the Polonius' saying "brevity is the soul of wit" is often used as actual advice for telling jokes. While this is true in a lot of cases (as the listener might get bored if you take way too long to get to the punchline). The character in question is anything <em>but</em> brief or witty, and the quote is said at the beginning of a long, rambling monologue. In other words, it was meant as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a>, as opposed to actual advice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Romeo, Romeo... Wherefore art thou Romeo?" Not a misquote but a common misinterpretation; it doesn't mean "Where are you, Romeo?" but "Why are you Romeo?" i.e., "Why is it the one named Romeo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Montague</a> that I love?" This one is so firmly ingrained (by a million comedy skits that have Romeo replying "I'm down here!") that when David Beckham named his son Romeo, one British newspaper felt it had to alter the quote to ask <strong>WHY</strong> FOR ART THOU ROMEO? Poor dears thought they were punning. The dating website <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OKCupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OKCupid">OK Cupid</a> uses this as a shibboleth to help theater and literature nerds find each other.
</li><li> "A rose by any other name smells just as sweet." - it's actually: "What's in a name? <strong>That which we call</strong> a rose by any other <strong>word would smell</strong> as sweet."
</li><li> <em>When I saw you I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew.</em> is neither a quote from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em> nor even by Shakespeare. It comes from Giuseppe Verdi's opera <em>Falstaff</em>, based on ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingJohn">King John</a></em>: "To gild refined gold, to paint the lily" was shortened to "gild[ing] the lily", which makes less sense. To "gild" something is to add gold to it, usually to the edges. Hence the point being made is that adding gold to gold is superfluous; as is "painting the lily" (since it's already colorful) or "throwing a perfume on the violet" (which already smells pleasant). While adding gold edges to a flower might be impractical, it could still theoretically improve its beauty.
</li><li> Doesn't exactly fit, but an example in the same vein, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a></em>: <em>"Now is the winter of our discontent / made glorious summer by this sun of York"</em> - it means "Our winter of discontent has now been ended by this sun [son] of York". "Now is the winter of our discontent" is often used or cited on its own as a complete thought, to express sorrow, even though it of course makes no sense in the context of the play or even the full sentence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a></em>: "Stand on ceremony" is used to mean "be ceremonious and formal", when it actually means "pay attention to omens and portents", which when you think about it, makes "stand on" make more sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em>: "If music be the food of love, play on" is quoted a fair bit, without the next part, "Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,/The appetite may sicken, and so, die." It's not a cheery request for more music to arouse more love, it's an order/prescription for an emotional purgative: give me enough to make me (metaphorically) throw up and stop being in love.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale">The Winter's Tale</a></em>: The "most famous piece of stage direction in history" is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitPursuedByABear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitPursuedByABear">Exit, Pursued by a Bear</a>", not "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">Exit stage left</a>, pursued by a bear". Perhaps people are mixing up Shakespeare and Snagglepuss?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidsummerNightsDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidsummerNightsDream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em>, Puck doesn't say "Oh what fools these mortals be!" The actual line is "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"
</li></ul></li><li> William Congreve's play, <em>The Mourning Bride</em> said "Music <em>has</em> charms to soothe <em>a</em> savage <em>breast</em>" (i.e. music can help you calm down when your emotions are out of control). People will often quote it as "Music <em>hath</em> charms to soothe <em>the</em> savage <em>beast</em>".
<ul><li> Also, "Hell hath no fury like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Woman Scorned</a>" is actually "Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor Hell a fury like a woman scorned." There is no "hath" at all in the line. (Or in any other line written in a William Congreve play, for that matter, since he lived in a time where "hath" had fallen out of use in favour of "has" already.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>East Lynne</em>, Lady Isabel does not say, "Dead &mdash; and never called me mother!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note139gas');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note139gas" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note139gas');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This would be erroneous, since "Mother" <em>is</em> her son's last word as he dies in her arms.</span> The actual line in the play is, "See here &mdash; my child is dead! and never knew that I was his mother."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14qc5t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14qc5t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14qc5t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The novel the play was based on had only the narration commenting on this dramatic situation; an earlier dramatization, <em>The Tangled Path</em>, omitted the scene entirely.</span> The misquote was popularised by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow">The Goon Show</a></em> which used it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>; in one episode Neddie Seagoon actually calls it "an excerpt from <em>East Lynne</em>".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/YouCantTakeItWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/YouCantTakeItWithYou">You Can't Take It with You</a></em>, Kolenkhov never says "Confidentially, it stinks," though he more than once says "it stinks" and once, in reference to Essie, says, "Confidentially, <em>she</em> stinks." The Rodgers and Hart song "Ev'rything I've Got" also just barely misses using the exact phrase. It doesn't help that parodists often distort the line further, to "Confidentially, <em>this</em> stinks!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Grease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Grease">Grease</a></em>, Sandy's full name isn't "Sandra Dee." Her name is Sandy Dumbrowski in the stage version, Sandy Olsson in the film, and Sandy Young in the TV remake. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraDee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraDee">Sandra Dee</a> was, of course, a popular actress, and when Rizzo calls Sandy "Sandra Dee," she's comparing her squeaky-clean persona to the actress's image.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy">Gypsy</a></em>, June and Louise call their mother "Momma", other characters just call her Rose, and she sometimes bills herself as "Madame Rose." Not once is she referred to as "Momma Rose", although it is a decent catch-all name for her.
</li><li> Another in-universe occurrence is in the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ByeByeBirdie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ByeByeBirdie">Bye Bye Birdie</a></em>. Having become frustrated with her fianc&eacute;, Rose makes the following remark about men: "They're all alike - from puberty to senility, from Benedict Arnold to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Mussolini</a>." Kim overhears Rosie and later truncates the quote in front of her parents: "Rosie was right! Men are all alike - from puberty to Mussolini!" (This causes her father, Harry, to complain about his daughter using such words in front of him.)
</li><li> Cedric Diggory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AVeryPotterMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AVeryPotterMusical">A Very Potter Musical</a></em> is often depicted going around randomly blurting out the word "Find!" He does this exactly once in the trilogy, and the moment is actually pretty easy to miss. He does say "find" a lot, but he generally uses it in actual sentences.
</li><li> The line 'I saw Goody Proctor with the devil' is normally used to reference the scene at the end of Act One of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheCrucible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheCrucible">The Crucible</a>" where the girls cry out variations on 'I saw X with the devil'. However, that precise line does not appear in the play.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WaitingForGodot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WaitingForGodot">Waiting for Godot</a></em>, the very last stage direction in Act I is <em>"They do not move"</em>, but it's frequently misquoted as <em>"They do not</em> <em><strong>go</strong></em><em>".</em> Though inaccurate, this phrasing fits a bit more humorously with the last lines of Act I, which it's meant to contrast.

The thing is, that never actually happens in any of the games. There is no cut off when you die, and the words "YOU DIED" simply fade in when you die and do not wave.

While the principles behind memetics and meme theory are described in-depth and are an important aspect of the game's story, the word "meme" itself is rarely, if ever used.

This includes mixing up the order the two phrases are said, or who says which one.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cloud:</strong> ...Hmm. That's how you'll fool them. <br><strong>Aerith</strong>: .........Hmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them.
</div></li><li> Barret says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MrT">foo'</a>" once, during his date scene, and it was altered for the PC release (into 'spike-head') suggesting it shouldn't have been there. He also once uses "fools" to address AVALANCHE. He then says it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</a></em> and it's referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, both in the assumption that it was his catchphrase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> has an NPC in Kilika who says "I'm gonna be a blitzball when I grow up!" It is often quoted as "I want to be a blitzball when I grow up!"

<ul><li> People seem to have a habit of quoting the Mushroom Retainers' line from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> as "Sorry, Mario, but our princess is in another castle!", when it's "Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!" Sometimes it's misremembered as "your princess". There's also no comma between "Thank you" and "Mario" in the text, at least not in the original and <em>All-Stars</em> versions of the game.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17xsf1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17xsf1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17xsf1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">However, there is one in <em>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em>.</span>
</li><li> Waluigi has never actually said "Too bad, Waluigi time". That line comes from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BrawlInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BrawlInTheFamily">Brawl in the Family</a></em> comics. He does say "Waluigi time", since "[Name] time" is a somewhat common catchphrase shared by Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi in several games. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMartinet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMartinet">Charles Martinet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeAcknowledgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeAcknowledgment">has said it</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcdTwhcO-B8">upon request<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as well.
</li><li> Similarly, "What's-a going on here?", a phrase stereotypically attributed to all four of the Mario and Wario brothers, has only been spoken <em>once</em> in any Mario game: by Waluigi in the intro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis">Mario Tennis</a></em>. Mario himself does come pretty close in the intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioVsDonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioVsDonkeyKong">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a></em>, though.
</li><li> "It's-a me, Mario" is often attributed as Mario's catchphrase, yet he only said it in one game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> as well as the commercial for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a></em>. He came close in the intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf">Mario Golf</a></em>, where he identifies his golf ball from his face on it ("Ah! It's-a <em>me</em>!"). Doopliss uses this phrase gratuitously when impersonating Mario in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, likely banking on this.
</li><li> Princess Daisy is often associated with her infamous line "Hi, I'm Daisy!", which originated in <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</em>. Many of Daisy's soundbites from that game, including said quote, were recycled in a few of the <em>Mario &amp; Sonic</em> games, but other than that, the line has not been used since. Regardless, the quote is often used to antagonize Daisy, with some fans of the franchise facetiously claiming that Daisy says it in every game she appears in. That said, she is infamous for saying it a <em>lot</em> in that game; due to a bug.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> The titular character never actually said "Gotta go fast!". It's just the title of the American theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>. He does say "Gotta speed up!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>, however. This would eventually be subverted when he says it in <em>Sonic Boom</em>.
</li><li> In the first game, the fifth stage is Star Light Zone, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone">Twilight Zone</a>.
</li><li> It's widely assumed that Shadow has the nickname "Faker" for Sonic. In reality, <em>Sonic</em> calls <em>Shadow</em> "Faker" during their confrontation on Prison Island, to which Shadow replies "I think <em>you're</em> the fake hedgehog around here!" The term is never used again afterwards.
</li><li> Sonic doesn't call Amy "Ames". The first time Sonic said this was in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> cartoon.
</li><li> Shadow calling Amy "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">Rose</a>" doesn't appear in canon. Shadow uses "Amy".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroWing">Zero Wing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The captain doesn't say "Launch every 'Zig'" or "Launch all 'Zig'", but rather "Take off every 'Zig'", and later "Move 'Zig'".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18k7rz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18k7rz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18k7rz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Capitalization is ours. The game proper's in all caps, like pretty much every game of that era.</span>
</li><li> The mechanic is frequently misquoted as saying, "Somebody set us up the bomb." The actual line was, "Somebody set <em>up us</em> the bomb," which is just as grammatically incorrect as the rest of the sequence. It's also "some<strong>body</strong> set up us the bomb", not "some<strong>one</strong> set up us the bomb". This misquote originated with the synthesized voice-over from the Flash animation.
</li><li> Due to the in-game text being in all-caps, the villain of the game is often named as "CATS", even though the back of the box and instruction manual make it clear it's just "Cats". His name is not an acronym.

When he actually says the phrase, it is an upper-body shot in which he holds a chalice of wine. It is also often misquoted as "LINK MAH BOI".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> Navi's infamous line is "Hey! Listen!" This was constructed from two of the more common phrases in her voice grunt set ("Hey!" by itself is the most used), and she never once says this directly to Link in her dialogue.
</li></ul></li><li> While not actual speech, several trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> showed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Miranda Keyes</a> appearing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual-wield</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">a pistol and a shotgun</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em>: The titular character, Conker the Squirrel, is referred to in many publications for his "foul mouth" and tendency to "blurt streams of expletives". While the game has plenty of foul language, almost none of it comes out of Conker's mouth. On the contrary, he's probably the most <em>innocent</em> character in the game, as a contrast to the raunchy setting. He does say "bitch" once, near the end of the game, but that's only because he was quoting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">Alien</a></em>. None of the words he says is bleeped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Coach from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> is commonly viewed as someone who is obsessed with chocolate, due to him eating a chocolate bar in the intro and Nick teasing Coach about the escape chopper being made of chocolate. Coach never makes any reference to chocolate at all in the game - burgers, cotton candy, and pretty much any other food, yes, but never chocolate. This is probably due to his visual similarities to Doc Louis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>, who in the Wii version is obsessed with chocolate.
</li><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">the first game</a>, on this very wiki one could find ten different versions of Bill's "if I start to turn" speech from the elevator in No Mercy, and every single one of them would be wrong. Oddly enough, Francis' response is never miswritten - then again, it's about half as long and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">much funnier</a>, and so probably sticks better in people's heads.
</li><li> Also from the first game, Louis is only known for his uncanny way of saying "Pills here!" as if he found a box of candy, despite the fact that Louis only says the line if the player uses the "Look" vocal command while looking at pills item.
</li><li> Ellis is commonly seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> that is obsessed with the Kiddieland amusement park and horses. Ellis only gets excited about Kiddieland once in the Dark Carnival campaign and that's only if the game actually picks that line of dialogue for him to say. Likewise, he only says "Horse!" when he sees a statue of a horse in The Parish campaign as an observation. All the parodies online of Ellis will have him going nuts over horses and Kiddieland.
</li></ul></li><li> Azuria, the Atlas Park magical contact in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, has a reputation for allowing anyone to walk into the MAGI (in essence, the generic magical government agency) vault. She is not even in charge of the vault; that's her counterpart in Galaxy City. She is commonly the dropoff for magical storyarcs, though.
</li><li> Giygas of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> is often quoted as saying, <em>"I... feel... h...a...p...p...y."</em> He separately said <em>"I... feel... g...o...o...d,"</em> and <em>"I'm ... h...a...p...p...y"</em>, but never together as <em>"I... feel... h...a...p...p...y..."</em> It's also quite common to see his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">Madness Mantra</a> mashed together as <em>"nessnessnessnessnessnessnessnessnessness"</em> etc, but each iteration of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Ness</a>" (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">whatever the player called him</a>) is actually properly punctuated and spaced as <em>"Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness, Ness..."</em> etc.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Adachi</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> is often associated with the line "Bitches and Whores", though he never said it once in the game. However, the line <em>does</em> pretty much sum up his opinion on girls. The line actually comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSub">Gag Sub</a> of a doujinshi. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">He does say it in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame">The Anime of the Game</a> though.
</li><li> No one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> says "We don't go to Ravenholm." The misquote is likely taken from the title of the chapter that is displayed when the player enters Ravenholm for the first time. The actual quote;
<div class="indent"><strong>Alyx Vance:</strong> That's the old passage to Ravenholm. We don't go there anymore.
</div></li><li> Many (though not all) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>-based memes say "arrow <em>to</em> the knee" instead of "arrow <em>in</em> the knee".
<ul><li> On a more nitpicky scale, the incantation for Unrelenting Force is often quoted as a quick, loud, and steady "<em><strong>FUS RO DAH!</strong></em>", when in the actual game it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">Punctuated! For! Emphasis!</a>: "<em>Fus...<strong>ro DAH!</strong></em>". The confusion arises from the fact that the first version, while not used in the final game, <em>is</em> the version used in the trailer, which became popular in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YoutubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YoutubePoop">Youtube Poop</a> even before the game was released. Furthermore, many players prefer the version used in the trailer (there's even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> that replaces the sound effect for the shout with the trailer version).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a> 4: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em>, during a flashback mission set in Pripyat, Captain MacMillan comments on the lack of people. His line is frequently mistaken to be "Fifty-thousand people used to live here. Now it's a ghost town." That line is actually spoken by Gaz in the intro that plays when you start the game up; MacMillan's line is actually "Fifty-thousand people used to live in this city. Now it's a ghost town... I've never seen anything like it."
</li><li> The infamous "The cake is a lie" meme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> is heavily misquoted from the rogue AI, GLaDOS. The character in question does have several lines regarding cake, but the actual quote comes from graffiti on the wall in a hidden room, which was written by another test subject named Doug Rattmann that slowly went insane. Since the meme became extremely popular, people who have not played the game usually assume the AI says it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>: Garen's battlecry of "DEMACIAAAAAA!" is associated with his spinning attack, Judgment, within not just the fanbase but also the game, but he actually yells the line when activating his defensive self-buff, Courage. The confusion arose largely because most Garen players would activate both powers virtually simultaneously. Occasionally, even his other skill, Decisive Strike, is associated with the battle cry of "DEMACIAAAA!!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series in general often gets called <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, but the proper name for the franchise is <em>Ace Attorney</em>.
</li><li> One of the lines most associated with the series is "You're lying goddammit! And I can prove it!", despite the fact that the line is only said once in any of the games and it's simply "dammit" instead of "goddammit".
</li><li> The series recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">Awesome Music</a> are frequently called "Cornered Themes" by the fandom. In reality, the correct term is "Pursuit" themes, only the first one is actually called "Cornered". The rest all have a different subtitle like "Questioned" or "Overtaken".
</li><li> The notion of Phoenix Wright accusing an animal of murder is something many people often wrongly attach to the series. Phoenix Wright, or any other protagonist attorney for that matter, has never pointed the finger at any animal. However the canon DLC case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Dual Destinies</a></em> does feature the <em>police</em> believing that an orca killed it's owner. However, not only do the police and the prosecution office not take it seriously as a murder at first (considering it the accurate "accidental death due to oversight over taking care of an animal" instead), Phoenix has to go out of his way to prove that there's a possible human criminal aspect involvement in the victim's death in order to get it be considered for a criminal trial case. The confusion likely stems from the fact that Phoenix has had to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeTheDogTestify" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeTheDogTestify">cross-examine</a></em> animals on multiple occasions.
</li><li> The single word most commonly associated with the series is <em><strong>"OBJECTION!"</strong></em> Within the games themselves, it is stylized as <em><strong>"Objection!"</strong></em> This applies to all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWordShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWordShout">Big Word Shouts</a> used in the series, with people erroneously using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCaps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCaps">All Caps</a> when quoting them.
</li><li> At no point does Miles Edgeworth ever say "You are not a clown. You are the entire circus." That quote is from an edited screenshot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fans joke about Cirno's infamous first spell card on Easy mode of <em>Embodiment of Scarlet Devil</em>, Ice Sign "Icicle Fall -Easy-"... except there's no spell card by that exact name in the game, since <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em> was the only game to actually append difficulties to the names of spellcards. Officially it's just Ice Sign "Icicle Fall". Somewhat justified, however, as the lack of appended difficulty names means that the version seen on Normal mode, which <em>doesn't</em> have that glaring flaw, has the exact same name.
</li><li> "Please wait warmly" is a frequent misquote of the line "Please watch warmly until it is ready" seen on the loading screens of the earlier Windows games.
</li></ul></li><li> Shigeru Miyamoto was misquoted when he was asked about his opinion over the visual style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>; while he did say (at the time) that people will enjoy a mediocre game if the graphics are good, he never said it for <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> and he had actually helped with the development of the game as well. What he actually meant by this comment was that he was annoyed that his bosses were interfering with the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld2YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld2YoshisIsland">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">by constantly trying to force him to mimic DKC's visual style</a>. Many years later, when he was asked about the incident, Miyamoto went on the record to say that he actually enjoyed the game.
<ul><li> Miyamoto also supposedly once said that "A delayed game is good (eventually), a bad game is bad forever." This is slightly incorrect. What he said was in response to why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> had been delayed (it was originally going to be a launch title), saying "delays are temporary, a bad game is forever".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Are you a boy or a girl?" meme is most commonly associated with Professor Oak. The problem is that in the first generation of Pok&eacute;mon games, there were no gender options and as a result he never asks the question. He does ask the player their gender in the remakes, but even then the line is actually two separate questions ("Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?") rather than as a single question.
</li><li> The line that shows up when encountering a wild Pok&eacute;mon is "A wild [species name] appeared!" (or "Wild [species name] appeared!" in the first three generations), not "A wild [species name] <strong>has</strong>' appeared!", "A wild [species name] appear<strong>s</strong>!", or any permutation thereof. Even official Pok&eacute;mon media has made this mistake.
</li><li> Lillie never says the exact phrase "Get in the bag, Nebby!" The closest she comes to saying it is when she says "Into the bag, Nebby" and "Back into the bag, please, Nebby."
</li></ul></li><li> "You know, Ellie, we really are the last of us" is never said in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em>. It is instead a meme poking fun of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narm</a> inducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">title drops</a> in gaming.
</li><li> Shiki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> is quoted on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a> as saying "PANTS. OFF. NOW!" when her line is actually "Now! Pants! Off!"
</li><li> One of the most common phrases said by fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> is "X fills you with DETERMINATION" with "X" being whatever the object/person/scene is when a save point is used. While the game does employ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldInflation">Bold Inflation</a> when it comes to certain words and phrases, "Determination" is proper case at save points. There is only one point where the game actually says "You're filled with DETERMINATION.", which is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just before the Asgore fight</span>.
<ul><li> Sans never calls Papyrus "paps" or "papy" in the game, though in fanon it seems to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a> for Papyrus.
</li><li> Many people quote <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sans</span> as saying "You're gonna have a bad time" before attacking you. Actually, he says that much earlier in the game, shortly before the battle with Papyrus, as a warning to stop doing the Genocide run. His specific quote before attacking you is "Do you wanna have a bad time?"
</li><li> "You dirty brother killer" is another line often associated with Sans on a Genocide route. He doesn't actually say this on a Genocide route(which does require killing Papyrus), but he does on certain Neutral routes after his judgment, if you've killed Papyrus and answer "no" to his question.
</li></ul></li><li> Naoki Yoshida, director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> was asked a question about whether or not a player who still hasn't gotten or finished a relic weapon from the 2.0 content should still do it when the relics for 3.0 were released. Many people believed he said that players shouldn't bother. What Yoshida actually said was people shouldn't bother if they haven't gotten a 2.0 relic or didn't make much progress on it since people would be better off starting fresh on a 3.0 relic anyway.
</li><li> Keiji Inafune, designer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyNo9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightyNo9">Mighty No. 9</a></em>, is infamously quoted as having responded "It's better than nothing" during a stream in response to the negative reactions to the game. This isn't actually what Inafune said himself, but an added comment from his interpreter.
</li><li> "Wololo", the Priests' conversion sound in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresI">Age of Empires</a></em>, is also associated with Monks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresII">Age of Empires II</a></em>, despite the fact that they make a "Waaaaahhhh..." sound.
</li><li> A popular meme with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em> is Sully exclaiming "Nate, noooooo!" when Nate dies while the game's death music plays. Sully does exclaim "Nate!" and "Noooo!" as potential exclaimations, but never both as one line.
</li><li> When it came to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a></em> after people found out it was supposed to be the sequel to the first game, a lot of people not only blamed Nintendo of America for rejecting the game, but they also believed that the company thought that the game was "too hard for Americans" and decided to localize <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiPanic">Doki Doki Panic</a></em> instead as <em>Super Mario Bros</em> sequel. While Nintendo of America did have concerns about the difficulty of the original <em>Super Mario Bros 2</em>, they never outright said that the game was too hard; their big concern about the game was it would not sell well because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">it was just the first game again.</a>
</li><li> "Metal Box", the name the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series uses for the green blocks in <em>Super Mario 64</em> that Metal Caps come out of, is not used in <em>Mario 64</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProWrestling">Pro Wrestling</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou">A Winner Is You</a>, but this message appears only in the earliest copies of the game, with the (much more common) revisions correcting it to simply "Winner is You".
</li><li> Most people call the directional pad on Nintendo controllers the "D-Pad". However, not once is it ever called that in official Nintendo publications, all of which call it the "+Control Pad". The term "D-pad" was actually coined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> game manuals (Sega's official term was "D-Button".)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>: Despite what <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em> might lead you to think, Cho never says "To his will, all flesh succumbs!" followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Gall</a> adding "Uhh... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHeSaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHeSaid">What He Said</a>." The quote was originally spoken by <strong>Gall</strong>, and was a slightly larger poem<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note104id');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note104id" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note104id');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To His will, all flesh succumbs! From His kingdom, chaos comes!</span> The response came from Cho, who was reacting to Gall's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">deteriorating mental state</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> spinoff games flipped this to downplay Gall's insanity in favour of general comedy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun">Kunio's</a> catch-phrase <em>Namen nayo</em> (which loosely translates to "Don't mess with me!") was actually said by his rival (and future partner) Riki in in the original <em>Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun</em> (the Japanese version of <em>Renegade</em>) and the full phrase is <em>Namen nayo, kono yarou</em> ("Don't mess with me, you punk!"). Kunio didn't actually say <em>Namen nayo</em> until the arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperDodgeBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperDodgeBall">Nekketsu Koukou Dodge Ball Bu</a></em>, where he says the phrase every time he does a running jump shot.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sinistar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sinistar">Sinistar</a></em> has many similar soundbites, which people often combine in ways it never actually said. For instance, it never says "Beware, coward, I live!" or "Beware, I hunger!" It does say "Beware, coward!", "Beware, I live!" and "I hunger!".
</li><li> Preston Garvey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> never actually says "Another settlement needs our help." He gives the Minutemen radiant quests with various lines: "I got word of a settlement that needs our help," "I've heard of another settlement that's in trouble," and "Another settlement has sent word that they need our help."
</li><li> The line "You have died of dysentery" never literally appears in the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail">The Oregon Trail</a></em>. The actual phrasing uses the third-person voice: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">[Character name the player entered</a>] has died of dysentery."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Xemnas</a> doesn't say "Embrace... nothing!" during the battle against him. The actual line is "Embrace... the nothingness!" but it's made hard to hear over the sounds of the battle. He also doesn't actually say "Cursed... Keyblade..." when defeated. The actual line is "Curses... <em>(shuddering breath)</em> Keyblade..."
</li><li> An inversion: The line "Sora... Riku... There is falsehood within your hearts. Do you dare deny it...?" is often included in lists of unused Xemnas quotes. However, the quote <em>does</em> actually appear in the game - he says it during the second battle with Armored Controller Xemnas, if you fail the Meteor Rain Reaction Command.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days</a></em>, Roxas's infamous line <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Xion is fading away</span> is "Who else will I have ice cream with?" It's misquoted in various ways among the fandom, usually by people making fun of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> quality.
</li></ul></li><li> Gill is quoted as having a line in the Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade">Harvest Moon: Animal Parade</a></em> that was censored out of the English translation: "I want to lock you up in my basement and keep you all to myself." Though the series is no stranger to risqu&eacute; dialogue, this line doesn't exist. It was originally a joke by a translator on a forum, but fans took it seriously.

<ul><li> Strong Sad never said "I don't like food anymore" or "Some animal died" either, despite their being two of his more quoted lines. The first one was in Strong Bad's imagination, and the second was an impression of him courtesy of Homestar respectively, though the second quote did become a Quote of the Week spoken by Strong Sad later on.
</li><li> Also, the real Strong Sad never said "I'm sad that I'm flying." That was The Cheat doing a bad impression of him. However, Strong Sad DID say "I'm sad that HE'S flying," referring to The Cheat on helium.
</li><li> One of the many recurring themes within the HSR fanbase is 1-up's pudding obsession when the only time he ever mentioned pudding was in the April Fools 'toon <em>Under Construction</em>.
<ul><li> Not to mention Strong Bad "DELETING!" emails asking how he types with boxing gloves on; not only does he do that <em>once</em> (in an episode where that question isn't even the main focus), but in the one episode where it <em>is</em> the main focus, none of the multiple emails asking that question are deleted.
</li></ul></li><li> The website BMUSed itself with the Peasant's Quest movie trailer. In the trailer, the blue knight says "You don't dress like a peasant... you don't smell like a peasant... and you're certainly not on fire like a peasant!" In the game, however, he says that Rather Dashing doesn't STINK like a peasant.
<ul><li> Rather Dashing is also shown eating the meatball sub in the trailer, which isn't actually possible in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The Drive-Thru whale is sometimes quoted as saying "Sever your leg please, sir. It's the greatest day". It said "Sever your leg please, sir" and "Sever your leg, please. It's the greatest day", but not both sentences with the word "sir".
</li><li> Homsar has never said "I was raised by a cup of coffee". That was Strong Bad, doing an impression of Homsar. It doesn't help that one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunTShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunTShirt">official Homsar tshirts</a> did bear the slogan "Raised By A Cup Of Coffee". Homsar did however finally say the phrase in the 2017 Halloween Toon "Haunted Photo Booth", in a manner similar to backwards speech. It was later revealed, however, to be a [[Twin Peaks]] reference and not him actually saying it.

<ul><li> Although Karkat cusses perhaps the most out any Homestuck character, his use of the term "fuckass" is wildly exaggerated by fans unable to duplicate the more florid profanity he favours in story.
<ul><li> Karkat has only said "fuckass" <em>once</em> within Homestuck. <em>Jade</em>, who doesn't swear very often, has said "fuckass" more than Karkat did (twice, due to Karkat's influence causing her to swear more often).

Thing is, the comic actually writes it as <em>"HUGE BITCH BLUH BLUH"</em>, but you'd be hard pressed to see it quoted that way. Also, while Vriska probably deserves the appellation more, it was originally in reference to <em>Snowman</em>. Its association with Vriska was a <em>reference</em> to that.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse">Masters of the Universe</a></em>: The villainous Skeletor is attributed to making a "Nyeah!" sound. While his voice is indeed oddly nasally, he never utters such a sound in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">the original series</a>. The "Nyeah!" instead comes from the famous singing He-Man video.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The background pony dubbed "Derpy Hooves" is famously associated with muffins. However, her "line" is questionable, as she is only one figure in a background crowd when the line is said and two other ponies have the same mouth flap at the same time. Additionally, she never delivered any mail in the show despite her being popularly considered a mailwoman in the fandom, likely due to a scene in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E15FeelingPinkieKeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E15FeelingPinkieKeen">Feeling Pinkie Keen</a>" in which Derpy assists in unloading a flying delivery cart with disastrous results. This was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">reconciled</a> when "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E9SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E9SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>" showed her as a mailmare with a thing for muffins.
</li><li> Many believe that "20 percent cooler" and "ten seconds flat" are Rainbow Dash's catchphrases, but she only said each phrase once all the way back in the first season (she said "ten seconds flat" in the very first episode), and then never again.
</li><li> A review of <em>Friendship is Magic</em> claimed that Applejack said "How do you like them apples?" in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E26TheBestNightEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E26TheBestNightEver">The Best Night Ever</a>", when it was actually in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E4ApplebuckSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS1E4ApplebuckSeason">Applebuck Season</a>".
</li><li> Minor compared to the other examples, but Tirek's line "Is this meant to be humorous?" in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E26TwilightsKingdomPart2">Twilight's Kingdom &#150; Part 2</a>" is commonly quoted as "Is this <em>supposed</em> to be humorous?"
</li><li> The phrase "love and tolerate" was never once uttered on the show. That was just a joke passed around forums and the like.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NinaNeedsToGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NinaNeedsToGo">Nina Needs to Go!</a>!</em>: People think Nina says, "Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!" when she has to pee. She only says "Can't wait!" one time in the mall episode, not three consecutive times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>: People often associate the Powerpuff Girls with the phrase "Girl Power!" when in actuality they never say this. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in an episode where Professor Utonium's roommate clones them. One of them says "Girl Power!" on TV, and the Professor says, "Since when do you ever say girl power?" Buttercup replies nervously with "Uh, yeah we say it all the time". However, there has been a Rowdyruff Boys vs. Powerpuff Girls game on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> website for some time, which uses the phrase "Girl Power!" whenever the girls have the upper hand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>: Due to <a class="urllink" href="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Russian+Roulette+Pops.+http+www.facebook.com+mybestestfriendkoolkeef_df7559_4266485.jpg">a certain image<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> circulating the Internet, many fans believe that there's a scene in "Grandpa's Bad Bug" where Grandpa talks about playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianRoulette">Russian Roulette</a>. The actual dialogue was just Grandpa telling Stu and Didi that he was sick, Didi offers to take him to the doctor but he tells her he just wants to sleep it off. The dialogue in the aforementioned image is lifted from an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</a></em>:
<ul><li> No villain ever said, "And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">those meddling kids</a>." This is a pastiche of various quotes (most called them "meddlers", not "meddling kids"), and many villains said nothing as they were carried off. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">However, they do say this in some future series</a>. Additionally, while the Scooby Doo gang (usually Velma or Fred) did do a lot of mask-removing, this was never referred to as "unmasking" on the series. Likely, an advertiser used it because of the wordplay and people thought it was an actual term used on the show.
</li><li> "Old Man Jenkins" has become the name to refer to the common villain under the mask. While the original series had an old man named <em>Mr.</em> Jenkins, he wasn't a mask-wearing villain, he was an amusement park caretaker who built Charlie the Robot as an assistant, but a programming glitch caused the robot to go haywire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2RadioactiveMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2RadioactiveMan">Radioactive Man</a>", during the acid flood segment, a line given by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAhnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAhnold">Rainier Wolfcastle</a> is often falsely quoted as "The goggles, they do nothing!", when the actual line is "My eyes! The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GogglesDoNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GogglesDoNothing">Goggles Do Nothing</a>!"
</li><li> "Can't sleep, clown'll eat me" is misquoted in many ways, such as "Can't sleep, the clowns will eat me." (which makes no sense, given that Bart is referring to a specific clown &mdash; i.e., the one Homer shaped Bart's bed into). This is probably due to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> song by that name: "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me".
</li><li> Bart only said "Cowabunga!" four times in the series. Once in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS2E1BartGetsAnF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS2E1BartGetsAnF">Bart Gets an F</a>", the Season 11 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E22BehindTheLaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E22BehindTheLaughter">Behind the Laughter</a>", which is a parody episode where during the rehearsal (the premise being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">the Simpsons are real people, acting out the show we usually see</a>; though upon cutting, Bart states he has never said those words in his life), The ending in "The Great Money Caper" and the first segment of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS17E4TreehouseOfHorrorXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS17E4TreehouseOfHorrorXVI">Treehouse of Horror XVI</a>". "Cowabunga!" originated on <em>Howdy Doody</em> in the 1950s and its common usage was popularized by 1960s surfer culture. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the characters you were most likely to hear use the phrase were actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, but some media still thinks "Cowabunga!" is Bart's catchphrase.
</li><li> The "You don't win friends with salad" chant is commonly changed to "You <em>can't make</em> friends with salad'.
</li><li> Jasper Beardly has been given the catchphrase "That's a paddlin'" despite only saying it in one episode.
</li><li> Poochie is often quoting as having said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"I must go. My planet needs me."</a> in "The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show". He actually says, "I <em>have to</em> go <em>now</em>."
</li><li> In one early episode, Lisa tells Bart to "embrace nothingness" which somehow wound up being her profile quote in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsons">the arcade game</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic phrase</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck">gosh diddly darn it"</a> is sometimes falsely attributed to Ned Flanders. Ned has said gosh, diddly, and darn it many times, but never all three words in a row. The closest he ever got was "I just can't dang-darn-diddly-darn-dang-ding-dong-diddly-darned do it".
</li><li> Marge's line from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E8HurricaneNeddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E8HurricaneNeddy">Hurricane Neddy</a>", "That's true, but he shouldn't say it" is often misquoted as "It's true, but he shouldn't say it!" when people use it online to react to certain things.
</li><li> Bart's "You can actually pinpoint the second his heart rips in half" is sometimes misquoted as "You can actually pinpoint the exact moment his heart breaks in half".
</li><li> "Won't somebody please think of the children?" is seen as Helen Lovejoy's catchphrase, but she only says the line in two different episodes. In one Season 9 episode, Moe subverts expectations by saying the line instead of Helen (who is right next to him). It isn't referenced again until Season 24, where Helen herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedCatchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedCatchphrase">subverts</a> the line by saying, "Won't somebody please blame the children?" in "Pulpit Friction".
</li><li> Principal Skinner is quoted as saying, "Am I out of touch? No, it's the children who are wrong" when the line is "Am I <em>so</em> out of touch?".
</li><li> "I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?" is often thought of as another catchphrase of Bart's thanks to a popular T-shirt released around the time the show became a craze. It was actually only said twice: once in a <em>Tracey Ullman</em> short where Bart says that to Krusty the Clown (thinking he's a phoney pretending to be him), and another in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS1E1SimpsonsRoastingOnAnOpenFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS1E1SimpsonsRoastingOnAnOpenFire">"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"</a> when Bart meets Santa (who is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Homer, who tried to get a job for the family so he could buy them presents</span>). In the latter, he actually says, "Well, I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cartman's line "No, Kitty! That's a bad Kitty!" is widely thought to have originated in the premiere episode "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". He actually says this in the Season 1 finale "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut" twice. His lines to Kitty in the premiere, aside from telling Kitty to get away from his food, are "No, Kitty! You bad Kitty!" and "No, Kitty, this is my pot pie! Bad Kitty!"
</li><li> The Underpants Gnomes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingStepsPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingStepsPlan">plan</a> is often given as "Stage 1 [xxx], Stage 2 ?????, Stage 3 Profit!" Their actual outline was:
<div class="indent">Phase 1 - Collect underpants [<em>the word "Phase", not "Stage"</em>] <br>Phase 2 - ? [<em>only one question mark</em>] <br>Phase 3 - Profit [<em>no exclamation mark</em>]
</div></li><li> An Apples to Apples box set once listed Stan and Kyle's catchphrase as, "Oh my God! <strong>We</strong> killed Kenny!" instead of, "Oh my God, <strong>they</strong> killed Kenny!" Although, to be fair, they <em>did</em> say that on two occasions when they themselves killed Kenny ("Yep, we're bastards").
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: In the episode "As Seen on TV", many sources claim that when SpongeBob sticks his nose out of the ground, Mr. Krabs replies with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Please tell me</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">that is your nose</a>." While <em>SpongeBob</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/SpongeBobSquarePants">was no stranger to jokes like this</a>, in actuality, he simply asks "What are you doing, lad?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>:
<ul><li> One line of the limerick in "The Sad Story of Henry" is often misquoted as "He went into a tunnel, squeaked through his funnel, and wouldn't come out again". The actual line uses "it" instead of "he".
</li><li> The infamous "Shut up! It's not funny!" line from "Break Van" is paraphrased. The full line is "'Shut up!' said James, 'It's not funny!'".
</li><li> Thomas, or any other character for that matter, never said "I'm a really useful engine!", other characters just called him that. James often called himself "a really splendid engine", though.
</li><li> A few common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memes</a> have become this. An example would be the "The Fat Controller laughed. "You are wrong,"' meme from "Thomas and the Rumours". The actual quote is, "The Fat Controller laughed. 'Well, the engines are wrong and you shouldn't listen to rumours, Thomas.'"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThreeLittlePigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheThreeLittlePigs">The Three Little Pigs</a></em>: The words "not three little pigs" are not actually said. The last line is just straight instrumental. In later cartoons, the pigs did elaborate the lyrics a bit, once ending with a humorously drawn-out "He's a great big sissy!"
