<ul><li> Autor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em> fits this trope to a T...at least at first. He's an insufferable know-it-all who believes that he's a descendant of Drosselmeyer and also the absolute expert on the subject of his powers. He puts another character who wants to learn about his powers through a series of ridiculous 'training' exercises, including standing in the middle of a room for three days without eating or sleeping and only using "blue and black ink in a seven-to-three ratio". Eventually he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">humiliated</a> when the character he's training proves to have much more power than him...if he ever had any power at all. In the end it's slightly subverted, however&mdash;the character he "trained" is forced to go back to him for help because he actually <em>is</em> one of the best experts on Drosselmeyer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, South Korea always claims he invented everything (well, almost everything. No one takes responsibility for condoms).
</li><li> Takashi Yamazaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> is always making up lies he claims to be facts. Interestingly enough, while most know he's lying both Sakura and Syaoran tend to believe him at first, before Chiharu breaks it to them that they're being lied to and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">lays the smackdown on Yamazaki</a> (Naoko and Rika are too saintly amused to say anything), though one or two times, he <em>is</em> right in his extravagant speeches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wizard of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Greenhorn Party</a>. While Warrior and Fighter were more caught up in the excitement on being on their first adventure to pay attention to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Priestess</a> voicing her very reasonable concerns about how under-prepared they are, Wizard takes it a step further by criticizing Priestess for worrying. Naturally, things go to hell for her the moment the goblins arrive.
</li><li> Her brother, Wizard Boy, was also this. Nobody liked him because he acted likes he's hot stuff and insisted on bossing the other low-ranking adventurers around, despite being a magic school dropout and the only one without field experience. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He tries to usurp command from Priestess (who is Obsidian-rank and has a decent amount of field experience after being an adventurer for a year) leading a practice rookie mission twice, the second time leading the group into a troll's nest and putting everyone in danger</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Umino Gurio in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, <em>academically</em> smart, just very lacking in common sense.
</li><li> Hanamichi Sakuragi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em> is actually pretty stupid but always goes around saying "Ore wa tensai!" (I am a genius) and "Ore wa tensai baskettoman!" (I am a genius basketball man), both of which he only does to impress Haruko and, by extension, out of jealousy of Rukawa. While he <em>does</em> get good at basketball as the series goes on, he's still so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> it hurts.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIRedJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIRedJacket">Lupin III (Red Jacket)</a></em> featured Sherlock Holmes III among a group of detectives hired to outsmart Lupin. In the original version, he was a cultured gentleman. The Geneon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> turned him into a total nitwit who is always either stating the obvious or completely ignorant of the obvious &mdash; for instance, upon noticing an opulent dining fork, he proclaims it "a dining implement of some kind; a bit showy, whatever it is." Granted, the Holmes seen for most of the episode is actually Lupin in disguise, and when the man himself gets a chance to talk he seems pretty on the ball.
</li><li> Saori Takebe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> tells the girls on their Tankery team all about how to win over a guy. Then one of them innocently asks if she has a boyfriend, to which she becomes speechless, since she never had one in the first place. The girls try to cheer her up anyway.
</li><li> Sakura Haruno is a practical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of this trope from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. While she was one of the top students of the Academy (second only to Ino who had became the Kunoichi of the Year), she considered herself a lot stronger than the 'Dead-Last' Naruto Uzumaki since she equated 'knowing more about textbook things translates to real life'. During her first <em>real</em> mission in the Land of Waves, she realized Naruto was not only stronger than her but had pulled far ahead and during the Chunin Exams, she sacrificed the long hair she had grown meticulously so Sasuke would notice her in an attempt to save her teammates who were unconscious from the battle with Orochimaru. Sakura eventually becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Tsunade</a>'s apprentice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesALevelInBadass">Takes A Level In Badass</a> in the first arc of Part II...and then has no truly memorable fights afterwards, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> on the sidelines at best. However, during the last stage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc">War Arc</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she can keep up with KCM Naruto <em>and</em> a Complete Susano'o EMS Sasuke...until she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a> rather quickly, and after realizing that she just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a>, she ultimately has to rely on her two teammates yet again.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UmiMonogatari">Umi Monogatari</a></em>, the Elder Turtle has shades of this; not only is he wrong about which priestess will fall into darkness, he doesn't comprehend what Sedna truly is and gives wrong information as a result.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Krillin when he was a kid. He is knowledgeable about martial arts, but he likes to act like he knows more than he actually does. This is made worse that his training partner, Goku, is really naive and often defers to Krillin when something confuses him. He thankfully gets better as the series goes on.
</li><li> Seto Kaiba from the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, mainly for being the token skeptic, continually denying magic despite his technology glitching and the impossible happening right in front of his eyes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Max</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">downplayed</a> example, as he has plenty of book smarts that let him recite Pok&eacute;mon facts and statistics from memory, but zero practical experience to back up his boasting. For example, he chastises Ash for losing in a high-level battle tournament and claims that he could've done a better job, but later episodes demonstrate that Max's battle tactics suck.
<ul><li> Iris from the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonBestWishes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonBestWishes">Best Wishes</a> series tries to come off as smart and knowledgeable about the world because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferioritySuperiorityComplex">Inferiority Superiority Complex</a>. In reality she knows next to nothing about the world, having grown up isolated and afraid of social interaction. The fans will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">never forget</a> the time she thought Charizard was a Dragon-type. (You would have made the same mistake, too, but you're not trying to become a Dragon Master!)

It later comes out that this trope is the kind of Yo-kai he is, with his power being spewing a gas that induces others to confidently state made-up facts to whoever's around, though that wasn't the case for the 1st game, and even then, he's still quite intelligent and capable in the rest of the games, even when he's using the Wiki more often than the 1st. Hell, he's usually the one to figure out any Yo-kai mischief nearby in ALL the games instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp">just bizarrely denying it like in the anime.</a>

<ul><li> Lucy Van Pelt thinks that snow falls up, fir trees have fur on them, and that a chain line is so that climbers can all fall of mountains and die together instead of it having the exact opposite purpose (so that the climber falling doesn't fall to his death because the others are holding him up).
</li><li> Snoopy had some moments like this too. His rule of thumb whenever he got lost was that the moon is always over Hollywood.
</li><li> A variant is Peppermint Patty; she'll get a dumb idea from a complete misunderstanding about something, ignore all common sense advice as she pursues this fixation until she humiliates herself and typically blames the people who warned her for not stopping her.
</li><li> Sally Brown. She's too lazy to do research for her homework, so she usually just makes things up. While she has no qualms about simply bluffing, she often does mistakes in good faith, based on what she's heard or what she thinks she's heard.

Watterson's commentary says that he assumes it must be a great temptation for real parents not to abuse their power for pranks.
<ul><li> One strip in particular had Calvin ask what makes the wind blow, which his dad initially tells him is "Trees sneezing". When Calvin questions this, his dad admits that the truth is more complicated. Cut to Calvin and Hobbes walking with a heavy wind.
<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin</strong>: Boy, the trees sure are sneezing today.

The writer explained it pretty simply: he was raised among Muggles but still got sorted into the house of all-Purebloods, and he believed that if he ever asked any questions about the magical world, it would "reveal" him as a possible Muggleborn and lead to social suicide. Hence, while he's fairly knowledgeable, he tends to act like he knows <em>everything</em>, when he's actually just bullshitting and making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong">Entertainingly Wrong</a> guesses.

Amontillado <em>is</em> a sherry.

Rather than ask for advice from the only person in the book who has actually achieved success in the film industry, she positions <em>herself</em> as the one who knows how to achieve success and talks at length about her career ambitions and how she plans to make them a reality, based on half-remembered and less-than-half-understood things she has read in fan magazines and trade papers.

Such as when Colon identifies hieroglyphs as a type of mollusk, and is asked if they go lower they'll find loweroglyphs, and decides to go for broke - everyone knows you don't get loweroglyphs in these waters. It is said he had a broad education; he went to the school of 'my dad always said', the college of 'it stands to reason', and is now a post graduate student at the university of 'what some bloke told me in the pub'.

Everyone, that is, save Ponder Stibbons, who occasionally fakes it, spouting his own ridiculous explanations (because he knows the <em>real</em> facts will only kick off another off-topic argument among his colleagues), the Bursar (who can actually translate Stibbons' explanation into layman's terms when he's not away with the frogs), Ridcully (who is definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>), and the Librarian. And of those four, the Bursar is insane, the Librarian is an orangutan, and Ridcully is not averse to flying off into tangential arguments of his own. Though, again due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, he could be doing that on purpose.

<ul><li> Part of this phenomenon, in the case of the wizards at least, may be attributable to the fact that (much like real-life scientists up until about the turn of the twentieth century) they consider new breakthroughs to be gross discourtesy rather than something to strive for.
</li></ul></li><li> Granny Weatherwax does this as well, insisting that elephant is "a kind of badger". Granny is well aware of her own shortcomings, but her 'Headology' requires her to make the common folk consider her nearly omniscient.

He's an above-average Keeper and has some decent tactical ability, but believes he can play every position better than everyone else on the team. When he takes over for Ron during Gryffindor's second match of the year, he tries to command the players in Harry's place, lectures his own team's Chasers for losing the Quaffle to the point of failing to defend the hoops, and takes the Beater's bat out of one Beater's hand with intention to 'demonstrate how to hit a Bludger'. That last one results in him hitting the Bludger <em>at his team's Seeker</em>, cracking his skull and knocking him out for the rest of the match, causing Gryffindor to lose 320-60.

However, the original Dr. Watson also had moments. In "A Study in Scarlet", he unknowingly mocks an article he reads in a magazine to Sherlock Holmes . . . the article's author. In "The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax" he arrogantly ignores Holmes' request to describe a suspect's ear, and fumbles the case so badly that Holmes has to go in person to save the situation. Watson similarly performs poorly in "The Case of the Solitary Cyclist". While generally responsible and competent in "The Hound of the Baskervilles", Watson begins by pridefully making a series of deductions on Dr. Mortimer with reference to his cane . . . all of which were incorrect, as pointed out by Holmes.

He then proceeds to easily swindle a person into taking the dollar, in exchange for... two quarters. Because two is more than one, you see, and therefore he got the better end of the bargain. He then talks several other people into swapping the two quarters for three dimes, then four nickels, then five pennies, each time chortling at his intellect as he effortlessly walks away with more than what he started. When he shows the five pennies to his father and happily explains, all his father can do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence">stare silently and shake his head.</a> Obviously, he's just that proud of him!

Against everybody's advice, he blabs around about going after Flint's treasure. Trelawney then hires Long John Silver as the cook and has <em>Silver</em> choose most of the crew. Amplified in the 1934 film, where Nigel Bruce gives the character a "Boobus Brittanicus" quality. Fortunately, once Silver's plot is discovered, Trelawney acquits himself very well, owning himself "an ass" and awaiting the captain's command.

Owl is an example of a dead subtrope which was common back then; a Victorian school graduate with surface knowledge and a lot of arrogance, and the fact that he is barely literate takes the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

It gets him another character, Hardesty Maratta, into trouble or injured several times, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventually gets Jesse killed</span>.

It's not until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his death</span> that he realizes that he's kept falling back on his old habits without even realizing it.
</li><li> In the short story <em>Everyday Use,</em> Mama's daughter Dee is trying to immerse herself in her family's African culture, but repeatedly fails to understand its true meaning, or what it means to her family. She changes her name to "Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo" to protest the oppression and cultural whitewashing of black Americans, ignoring Mama's protest that the name "Dee" is just as important to their family if not more, having been passed down through many generations. The title of the story comes from Dee/Wangero's reaction to Mama not giving her a particular handmade quilt to hang up, saying that it should go to her and not her sister Maggie because the latter would "probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use". Dee/Wangero only views the quilt as a kind of trophy, something to be used to display pride in her heritage, while Maggie learned to make quilts from their mother and even sewed some of her own quilts, showing a more in-depth understanding of their family's traditions that she doesn't flaunt or take unnecessary pride in.

<div class="indent">"Well ya see, Norm, it's like this. A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells.

To be fair, Neelix is quite knowledgeable about the Delta Quadrant, which is why he's the ship's designated guide. The comedy in the character comes from his desire to prove that he's more than just a tour guide. He's also a competent cook, it's his very limited selection of ingredients and refusal to listen to criticism that make his food less than savory. In the case of diplomacy, he does manage to recover from a diplomatic incident caused by Janeway putting her hands on her hips, which is a grave insult to a race that relies heavily on body language.

Unlike the likes of Gallileo, Copernicus and Ignaz Semmelweis (whom Cranks may compare themselves to), whose theories were proven correct despite conflicts with established authorities, Cranks are characterized as overestimating their own knowledge and abilities regardless of others opinions and experience, insisting their discoveries are urgently important while rarely if ever acknowledging faults no matter how trivial.

</li></ul></li><li> Starscream from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> was always lecturing Megatron about tactics, and naturally, was nearly always wrong. The episode "War of the Dinobots", in which Starscream is suspicious about the instability of the meteorite's energy long before Megatron ever has a clue, is among the exceptions. (That makes a certain amount of sense, since Starscream was a scientist originally).
</li><li> Peggy Hill of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, who is convinced she's perfectly fluent in Spanish, when she can't even speak as well as some of the students she teaches as a substitute teacher. She thinks she is incredibly witty and deep. She also feels a need to be the winner, or at least right all the time.
<ul><li> This is taken to its logical extreme in one episode, in which Peggy takes her class on a field trip to Mexico and accidentally takes a Mexican girl home after misunderstanding her. After she returns the child, she's arrested and tried for kidnapping. She is ultimately acquitted after Hank prompts her attorney to have her testify in Spanish, showing the judge that she really did understand Spanish so poorly that the "kidnapping" had been accidental.
<ul><li> Best line in that episode?
<div class="indent"><strong>Judge:</strong> <em>[in Spanish]</em> Not Guilty! <br><strong>Peggy:</strong> Oh God! I'm going to jail!
</div></li><li> It should be noted though, early on, Peggy actually <em>was</em> very competent in Spanish, enough to where she got a job as a Spanish customer service representive by talking to a Spanish customer service agent over the phone. As the show went on though Peggy's "loose grasp" on the Spanish language <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">got worse and worse with each season.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Another running gag for Peggy is for her to make a very general or well-known fact and tack on, "In my opinion," such as, "The day after Thanksgiving is, in my opinion, one of the busiest shopping days of the year." Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealingTheCredit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealingTheCredit">tendency to take credit and boost her own ego</a> eventually came back to bite her when Randy Travis plagiarized a song she'd mailed to him and everyone, including Hank, thought she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a>.
</li><li> In another episode, while Hank and Bobby are out camping, Peggy runs around nosing her way into everyone's business and telling them how they're wrong or trying to show how much smarter she is. Ultimately this results in her going into a crime scene like she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> and getting escorted back to her car as she protests "But I'm on a roll!"
<ul><li> Notably, she was the only one to <em>not</em> know that Nancy had been cheating on Dale with John Redcorn, outside of Dale himself. When she did find out it was only because Hank essentially spelled it out for her.
</li></ul></li><li> Outside of Peggy, the Hills frequently run afoul of various "experts" who have more self-importance than any actual competence in their supposed field of expertise. It's often implied that the reason these people keep ending up in Arlen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">because they can't find work anywhere else</a>.
</li><li> Dale is much the same way, although not to as much of an extreme. It stems more from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> who believes his own lies about himself and his own competence. One of the most base jokes about his character is that even though he's convinced he's on the verge of uncovering various government conspiracies, he's too dim to realize his wife has been having a very public and obvious affair for more than ten years (although some episodes portray it more like full-blown denial).

<ul><li> Though Lisa is very smart and knows stuff people don't already know, Homer and Lisa's argument at the dinner table in "Lisa the Vegetarian" has Homer calling his daughter a "barbecue-wrecking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">know-nothing, know-it-all</a>". She does have a moment of this in "MoneyBART". When Lisa becomes the manager of Bart's baseball team, she claims that there have been several women managers and lists some off like Terry Francona and Connie Mack. Nelson tells her that all of her examples are men, much to Lisa's shock.
</li><li> Homer also proves to know less than he boasts, particularly in the episode "Homer Goes to College," where he interrupts a professor's lecture on a proton accelerator; the teacher finally asks him to demonstrate because he <em>must</em> know so well how it works ... only for Homer to somehow cause a nuclear meltdown.
</li><li> Plenty of so-called "experts" in the series are this, but "Smooth" Jimmy Apollo, a sports commentator in the episode "Lisa the Greek" stands out. He's frequently brought on TV for his excellent skills at predicting the outcome of games. How good is his accuracy? He's right a whole <em>52%</em> of the time! Sometimes, he likes to break out "the Lock of the Week", a massive padlock, to demonstrate games he thinks are definitely going to go one way. The Lock of the Week <em>also</em> has a 52% accuracy rate.

As God points out, there's no better metaphor for "I know everything" than pointing a gun to God's head and insisting He's wrong.
<ul><li> In National Treasure 4: Baby Franny: She's Doing Well: The Hole Story, Steve convinces Francine to prove her worth by solving one of the Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics. After an intense mathematics montage, Francine goes up to a professor at a college lecture and announces that she solved the Yang-Mills existence and mass gap problem. Her solution? The number 6. The professor informs her that the answer wouldn't be a number, but rather an entirely new concept in mathematics, and she frowns and walks away.

</li><li> Princess Hildegard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a>,</em> best exemplified in the episode "The Princess Stays in the Picture". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">When she was younger</a>, all the kids laughed at her because she couldn't do a "princess twirl", so she decided at that moment that she would always know everything so no one would laugh at her again. She finally eases up, and that character trait is never brought to the forefront again.
</li><li> Mart Mattin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> has shades of this attitude, made clear when he boasts about how he and his crew just took out a Star Destroyer when the ship in question was a light transport. He then sees a light cruiser, mistakes <em>that</em> for a Star Destroyer, and thinks they can handle it as well &mdash; except they don't, smashing his ego and leaving him in need of rescue. What's left of said ego is then fully squashed when a <em>real</em> Star Destroyer shows up.

<ul><li> The Italian satyrical magazine <em>Il Vernacoliere</em> held for some time an "ask the expert" column where the "expert" gave completely wrong answers to the readers' questions while talking down to his audience and using <em>way</em> more words than necessary.
<div class="indent"><strong>Q:</strong> Egregious Expert, could you tell me the meaning of the famous E=mc<span class="font-xs"><sup>2</sup></span> formula?

Twenty-nine, tops.
