I am thinking of the people in my universe and distilling for each of these people the one flaw in their character that will be their downfall&mdash;the flaw that will be their undoing. What I write are not sins; I write tragedies."</em>

</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heroes">Heroes</a> have a Fatal Flaw which they wrestle with on a consistent basis. This may open them up for specific conflicts later&#151;when a protagonist's fatal flaw is encountered through the course of a plot, the audience's reaction is very tense.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This is not to be confused with what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> calls <em>hamartia</em>, also a key part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">Tragedy</a>. A hamartia is a mistake or error a hero makes which leads to his undoing. It is <strong>not</strong> the same as a fatal flaw (though the two often overlap). This confusion arose from the misunderstanding of Aristotle's Poetics in the 19th Century.
</p><p>In classic literature, a Fatal Flaw is often what prevents a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> from succeeding, or serves as the cause of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMistake">Tragic Mistake</a>. It is usually some sort of character deficiency listed below or, in conventional television, an addiction of some sort. In modern television, the Fatal Flaw is more likely to lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>.
</p><p>When a hero zeroes in on a villain's fatal flaw (and they usually do), do not expect them not to <em>exploit</em> it.

She's quite responsible in most ways, but when dealing with stress or trauma, she (in Nico's own words) "throws herself at the nearest warm bod". This habit doesn't cause Nico's downfall, but it frays her self-esteem and sabotages her friendships.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupergirlRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupergirlRebirth">Supergirl (Rebirth)</a></em>, Director Chase thinks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Kryptonians</a> were arrogant, and their hubris led to their destruction. She also thinks that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> may have Kryptonian ego issues and still has anger management issues.

<div class="indent"><strong>Rorschach</strong>: No. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.</a>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s is a mixture of his insanity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">The Only One Allowed to Defeat You</a> stance towards Batman.
<ul><li> In general <em>most</em> Batman villains have a flaw related to their psychosis, which Batman naturally tends to exploit. For example:
<ul><li> Two-Face is too dependent on his coin.
</li><li> Poison Ivy with her obsession with plants.
</li><li> The Riddler would be a perfect thief if he wasn't always leaving riddles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>, of course, is eaten up by guilt over his parents' deaths.
<ul><li> Batman's paranoia, manipulative tendencies and reluctance to be open with people has also caused many problems for himself, his allies and the entire world over the years.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> can sometimes push him into borderline martyrdom. He's also far more secretive than he needs to be, and has a lot of trouble letting people into his life.
<ul><li> Superman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> is a petty, prideful egomaniac who often envies Superman to the point where he gave up a chance to become a god and create a utopia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBlackRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBlackRing">The Black Ring</a></em>, because on one condition is that he can't use his power to do evil. In this case, killing Superman. To him, even godhood is meaningless if it means he must let go of his hatred towards the Man of Steel.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a> is overconfident, often underestimating his opponents and not using his powers to their full extent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a>, another Superman foe, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> tendencies, often having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> when things go south. As Superman points out, this is basically his biggest weakness. Due to his absolute need to be in control of everything, Brainiac pretty much always works alone (and his rare team-ups are guaranteed to end in backstabbing), with his only consistent 'allies' being either his machines or people under mind control. By contrast, Superman always has friends and allies backing him, often giving him the edge over the alien.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a> has his feelings of inadequacy, which caused him health problems when he became Giant-Man, mental problems when his worries about not being good enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">Janet</a> led to him becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Yellowjacket</a>, and countless personal problems when his desire to prove himself as a meaningful member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> led to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroics">building a robot to attack the team so he could stop it</a>. Despite all of this, he still keeps trying to prove his worth as a superhero.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> shared some of the flaws of most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> supervillains such as overconfidence and excessive wrath, his biggest flaw is his dogged adherence to Nazi ideology, which can sometimes overrule even his legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a>. Hard as it might be to believe, some of his major schemes were failures because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">Principles Zealot</a> &#151; like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StubbornMule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StubbornMule">Stubborn Mule</a>, he wouldn't budge from his views.
</li><li> Across various iterations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s has been either his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">narcissism</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">crippling alcoholism</a>.
</li><li> Colonel Rick Flag of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a> is initially hailed for his devotion to completing his missions and doing his duty as a soldier. Unfortunately, he believes that same duty requires him to "carry on" for the friends and family who died in the line of duty, which leaves him with an extreme case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a>, culminating in him eventually going rogue. He finally realizes this flaw before setting off on one final suicide mission:
<div class="indent"><strong>Flag</strong>: I won't ask you to "carry on for me", Eve. That's a dead end I've found myself in. Live your life.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artemis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Artemis">Artemis</a> realizes shortly before her death that her arrogance has blinded her to threats and the damage her own words have caused, but when she tries to apologize to Diana for it as she lays dying Diana won't have it and puts the blame for Artemis' death entirely on others.

<ul><li> In the system called <em>House of the Blooded</em>, the characters are all nobility, seemingly built for high drama and Mary/Marty Sue-ism. Each character has six characteristics, each based off of one of the major families, and there is no rolling involved. You have four points for one characteristic, three for two others, two for two more... and the sixth characteristic gets a <em>zero</em>, meaning you can never use it. A zero in Strength means you are too physically weak to force open a sticky door, for example, thus ensuring that <em>all</em> characters have an inbuilt Fatal Flaw that cannot be legally circumvented.

Which worked so long as they did not find an outside competitor(I.E. Earth) The Fatal Flaw of the Terrans was more complex. It was in trying to govern the thousands of conquered Vilani worlds without the experience or inclination.

</li><li> The Infernals get a similar variant, known as Torment. If they defy the will of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Yozi patrons</a> for too long, then said patron will assume control and cause shit to go haywire.

</li><li> Even without supernatural curses or compulsions, each of the four virtues has drawbacks if you have three or more dots (and exalts have to have at least one virtue of 3+): compassionate characters have trouble making harsh decisions; temperate characters have trouble lying, cheating or going back on their word, no matter how dishonest the antagonist; valorous characters don't know how to back down from confrontation; and as for conviction, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">well</a>... Oh and it's perfectly possible for a character to have 3+ in two or more virtues. If they conflict, tough luck!
</li><li> Since Alchemicals didn't even exist when the Great Curse was handed down, they've been spared it. Nor do they have their own flaw bound as a Limit mechanic; instead, their Clarity rating measures how close their mindsets are to human as opposed to Autochthon's. Instead, each Alchemical gets their own personal problems - most notably Excessively Righteous Blossom, whose problem is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnorantOfTheirOwnIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnorantOfTheirOwnIgnorance">his head is up his arse</a>; he's incredibly bad at recognising when he doesn't possess a particular talent for something, meaning that whenever his duties take him outside "stabbing monsters" and into, for example, leading troops, it all ends in tears that are <em>of course</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">because of someone who is not Excessively Righteous Blossom why would you even think that</a>.

For example, Strahd Von Zarovich's flaw is his love for Tatyana, his brother's betrothed. This desire led him to become a vampire, murder his brother, and - most likely - cause her death, which condemned him to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell">Self-Inflicted Hell</a> forever. He can never have her, but is constantly tormented by visions of her and women who look just like her, both of which often cause him to take avoidable risks and make mistakes. If one hopes to have even a slim chance of defeating a Darklord, they must know what the flaw is and how to exploit it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a> are generally pretty fond of this trope. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">Changeling: The Dreaming</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> are particularly good examples as every sub-flavour of supernatural ("Kith" in <em>Changeling</em>, "Clan" in <em>Vampire</em>) has its own supernatural disadvantage.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> also has the option during character creation of giving a character a flaw which could potentially hinder them and - if done right - give extra experience points. Some of the flaws include addictions, Coward, Forgetful, and Behavior Blind. You are also required to select a Vice, which gives you a Willpower reward for doing something stupid in pursuit of it.

<ul><li> The Emperor's arrogance and detachment from humanity. He never felt the need to explain himself, and assumed that no one would betray or disobey him regardless of what he did. He also couldn't comprehend people's seeming need to believe in a higher power, and thus never believed that his own anti-religious actions would eventually lead to his people worshiping him, as the priest in The Last Church rightly observed.

</li><li> The Orks' love of fighting for its own sake.
</li><li> The Tau's belief in The Greater Good. It's heavily implied their tolerance for other cultures and liberal ideology will lead to the extinction of their species, especially in a universe where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Chaos</a> exists. Latter editions redefined this to being too trusting of the Ethereal Caste's teachings, with the Ethereals themselves intentionally hiding unpleasant truths, that they're completely not prepared to face some of the threats out there or seeing some of their side's own questionable actions and hypocrisy.
</li><li> The Ethereal Caste it self has adopted a belief that the T'au would be better off not knowing about what goes on throughout the rest of the galaxy, out of either fear that the truth would shake the faith in "The Greater Good" or simply losing their political power, mirroring several of the same mistakes the Emperor made with the Imperium.
</li><li> The Adeptus Mechanicus' insatiable curiosity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> has greatly slowed the Imperium's ability and willingness to adopt new designs, causing further items to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> due to their unwillingness to make or study anything that lacks an available Standard Template Construction. As well as accidentally awakening a number of Necron Tombs.
</li><li> Most of the primarchs had one:
</li><li> The Lion was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a> who couldn't read or relate to other people.
</li><li> Jaghatai was a loner who hardly ever associated with any of his brothers, so when the Heresy kicked off, he could trust nobody and nobody could trust him.
</li><li> Leman Russ had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> which meant he never questioned orders even when they were questionable, like being ordered to burn an entire world. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">his lack of tact</a> made him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Brother Nobody Liked</a>.
</li><li> Rogal Dorn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> tendencies often translated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> in battle. He didn't know when to stop. The Iron Cage incident exploited this and his legion was decimated as a result.
</li><li> Roboute Guilliman had a need for control and orthodoxy that often made his thinking predictable and inflexible. This was how Fulgrim ambushed and wounded him.
</li><li> Fulgrim had an obsession with emulating his father and perfecting himself that drove him to madness.
</li><li> Perturabo always felt like his father and his brothers never valued him or his accomplishments, so when the Heresy happened he fell in line with the one brother who didn't treat him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>.
</li><li> Konrad's unflinching desire for justice made him a brutal psychopath.
</li><li> Angron... Where to begin? His uncontrollable rage, his obsession with avenging his comrades, his resentment against his father for letting them all die, his inability to relate with any of his brothers because of the pain of losing his old ones on his homeworld, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a> tendencies which made him very hard to like... Poor guy.
</li><li> Mortarian's confidence issues led to him seeing council from the wrong people.
</li><li> Magnus recklessly and arrogantly sought knowledge and power wherever he could, which led to him turning to Chaos.
</li><li> Lorgar always sought a higher meaning to dedicate himself to. When the Emperor rejected him, he turned to Chaos.
</li><li> Alpharius' desire to constantly look like the most brilliant person in the room ironically made him very easy to manipulate for both Chaos and the Cabal. Also, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">Complexity Addiction</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which eventually resulted in his death at the hands of Dorn.</span>
</li><li> And finally, Horus, who above all other things wanted glory. He hated sharing credit with his brothers and eventually he hated sharing credit with the Emperor.

<ul><li> The Nuwisha alienated many Garou with their trickster ways. When the Wyrm targeted the Nuwisha for genocide, their reputation created difficulties for them when they sought refuge among the Garou.
</li><li> The Black Furies naively revered the Wyld for much of their history. This spelled doom for the tribe when a quarter of its members contracted the Wyld-tainted Metamorphic Plague.
</li><li> The Get of Fenris always placed too much emphasis on relentless combat and too little on subtlety. This gung-ho attitude drove the tribe to charge head-first into subterranean tunnels to fight the Black Spiral Dancers. Even when it was obvious that the Black Spirals were luring them deeper into the tunnels with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap">defensive feint traps</a>, the Get pursued their prey anyway, until the tribe fell to the Wyrm.
</li><li> The Uktena's close study of the Wyrm always worried the other tribes, and their strategy of binding banes under caerns was dangerous. In one Time of Judgment scenario, these bound banes corrupted the tribe's Bane Tenders, who in turn corrupted the rest of the Uktena.
</li><li> The Red Talon's uninhibited hatred of humans led them to eat human flesh. The Red Talons contracted a prion disease from eating human flesh, which they in turn passed on to other wolves, annihilating almost all of their wolf kinfolk.

</li><li> Kaede Akamatsu has a tendency to push her own personal sense of justice (what she believes is "right"), regardless of the consequences, which leads her to setting a trap to catch the Mastermind, even though she doesn't even know for definite that there is one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There <em>is</em> a mastermind, but Kaede's attempt to set a trap and kill the mastermind results in her being framed for the mastermind killing Rantaro, and thus being executed</span>.

</li><li> Kaito Momota's arbitrary trust in people is often completely misguided, and while he does have a point about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>, this attitude nearly gets everyone killed in the fourth chapter because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a> is too much for him to bear.
</li><li> Kokichi's is his constant lying to everyone. Though his lying tendencies do help out the group and allow him to outwit the culprits several times, it also gets in the way when he's genuinely trying to accomplish a goal and the other students don't believe him. It really comes back to bite him in the aftermath of Chapter Four <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Miu and Gonta are dead, which is almost entirely his fault, and the group turn their backs on him when he falsely claims to be the Mastermind. When the group are shown a Flashback Light concerning Ultimate Despair, they assume Kokichi is a member. When Kokichi kidnaps Kaito, Maki goes after Kokichi and confronts him. When Kokichi tells her (truthfully) that he has no idea what she's talking about, Maki naturally doesn't believe him and shoots him with a poisoned arrow, which will slowly kill him.</span>

<ul><li> How it's played depends on the particular adaptation. In the original visual novel this can be played straight or subverted since the player controls Makoto's choices. In the anime he's these with a heaping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> thrown in for good measure. In the manga it's played more sympathetically, with Makoto being more genuinely unable to decide on what to do, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but because he takes too long to commit to a decision, the situation still ends tragically.</span>

<ul><li> Mell's is cowardice. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He imprisons Morgana from his fear of Yukimasa, in spite of his beliefs that he's doing wrong. He refuses to tell anyone or speak against the lord and Yukimasa because he's afraid. It is noted that while his fear is understandable, it ultimately ended up causing Morgana's death.</span>

<ul><li> Rie's fatal flaw, by her own admission, is her adamant refusal to suspect her friends of any wrongdoing, especially not her best friend Runa, even when faced with the possibility that there's a murderer among them. This leads to some friction between her and Taiko, the latter of whom's investigating the killings and considers Runa a possible suspect, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although Runa is, indeed, innocent</span>.
</li><li> Taiko's fatal flaw is his tendency to let his friendship with Kotoba cloud his judgment. To his credit, he doesn't hesitate to call Kotoba out when he takes his perverted antics too far, but he's also initially unwilling to believe that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kotoba was stalking Momoko, or that she'd used him in her plan</span>. After Kotoba is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">badly burned or killed(depending on player choices)</span> as a result of the killer's plan, Taiko becomes irrational, and insists that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamen</span> is guilty, even though his theory has more than a few holes in it.
</li><li> Momoko's fatal flaw is her trust issues. In the past, she was overly trusting, resulting in many people taking advantage of her. As a result, she became unable to trust others, apart from her best friend Kamen and her boyfriend Hiro, and it took two years for her to truly open up to the former. Runa suspects that if Momoko was betrayed by either of the two people closest to her, it would break her, and for good reason. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Kamen tried to warn Momoko that Hiro tried to cheat on her with Kamen, Momoko refused to believe her, and threatened to end their friendship if Kamen continued trying to get between them. Momoko then discovered messages from Hiro on Kamen's phone, and concluding that Hiro and Kamen had betrayed her, plotted to murder Hiro, kill herself and frame Kamen</span>.

As a child, her obsession with finding her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">birth mother</a> meant that, the moment her father's back was turned, she dragged her sister on a quest to locate Raven.

This fighting style makes her predictable to the villains, enabling Neo to defeat and almost kill her without receiving a single hit in return and also enabling Emerald and Mercury to disgrace her as a ruthless fighter who will hit an opponent who is already down.

This has led to her losing badly several times. Cinder's driven to uplift herself while bringing everyone else down, even if she has to pause to waste time gloating instead of completing the plan without incident. If someone she perceives as beneath her gets the better of her, she will pay them back in the worst way possible, even if doing so is either pointless or detrimental to the long-term plan. If she thinks there's a way to fulfill Salem's mission and get what she wants she'll go for it, no matter how risky it is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her cruel, arrogant lust for power finally gets the better of her near the end of Volume 5, when she falls for Raven's decoy and exposes herself to defeat by Raven's hand. In Volume 7, her need to gloat to Fria instead of immediately taking Fria's power gives the ailing Winter Maiden time to focus her mind and protect herself just long enough for help to arrive. Cinder then wastes even more time to take revenge on Winter for cutting off her Grimm arm, distracting Cinder from killing Fria and allowing Penny to become the new Winter Maiden instead.</span>

He believes in Faunus superiority and plans for a day when humanity will be forced to serve the Faunus, but he's willing to ruin his own plans for short-term gain, such as the destruction of Beacon Academy or putting a hit out on Blake's family just because they oppose him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Murdering Sienna to obtain control of the White Fang and trying to assassinate the Belladonnas motivates a previously neutral Menagerie to form an army for the sole purpose of stopping him from doing to Haven Academy what he did to Beacon; his ability to control the White Fang is therefore destroyed by his own weakness almost as soon as he set his plans in motion.</span>

He implies to the heroes that his behavior stems from a desire to avoid being betrayed, leading him to engage in deflections, half-truths, lying by omission and pure deception. While he wants the heroes to trust that he has good reasons for his decisions, his tactics inadvertently alienate his allies. Ironwood's frustration with Ozpin's passivity leads him to go behind Ozpin's back and override Ozpin's responsibility for protecting the Vytal Festival while Raven abandoned him and his cause by investigating the truth for herself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ruby's group learn the truth through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower">Relic of Knowledge</a>, leading even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">loyal Qrow</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">turn on him</a>; his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">response</a> is to lock himself deep inside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharingABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharingABody">Oscar's mind</a> where even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Oscar</a> can't go.

His default tactic to any threat is overwhelming military force, which puts him at odds with Ozpin, Glynda and Qrow when he arrives in Vale with his army; while he thinks the show of force makes people feel safe, Ozpin points out it'll just make them wonder what the threat level is. While he expects others to trust him, Glynda points out that he's not willing to trust others in return. The mistrust and paranoia mean that he doesn't follow orders well because he's willing to turn on allies as soon as they do something he doesn't like, such as reporting Ozpin to the Vale Council after the first time the Grimm breach Vale's defenses. It also makes it easy for Cinder's manipulations to target him when the virus she uploads into Beacon's security network allows the villains to take control of the army he wasn't supposed to bring to Vale. Later, the villains pull similar moves on him in Atlas, ramping up his paranoia until he's willing to put Mantle under curfew, contemplate martial law and circumvent the democratic mandate of the Atlesian council just to get things done without having to share any information. The villains find him easy to manipulate while his allies find him difficult to work with. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Cinder breaks into his office just to leave a Black Queen chess piece on his desk, Ironwood's paranoia manifests in a panic of second-guessing whether every decision he's made has played right into Salem's hands. After Salem manifests in his office, revealing her forces are on the way to Atlas, Ironwood orders the arrest of Teams RWBY and JNR, Qrow and Oscar. Convinced he's now exhausted his troops trying to evacuate Mantle, he dooms the city to death by deciding to fly Atlas higher into the heavens and orders the arrest of everyone who's not on board with that plan to ensure they can't thwart him.</span>

</li><li> Redcloak, whose inability (Conviction) to back down from the path and plan he's chosen, despite all the senseless sacrifices, really bites him in <em>Start of Darkness.</em>
</li><li> Haley's flaw is greed, although unlike most examples, she's vaguely justified in this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her father is being ransomed for a small fortune and she became an adventurer to get enough money to save him from further imprisonment.</span> At one point, the gold and treasure she owns is destroyed in a fire, and Haley's shock is so great that it renders her <em>literally</em> unable to speak for the next hundred or so strips. (One of the reasons she likes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Elan</a> so much is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">his presence</a> encourages her away from this.)
</li><li> Miko Miyazaki, a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who refuses to believe that anything she does is wrong. Instead, she imagines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">a massive plot brewing behind the scenes</a> just to enable this belief. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's only when she's moments away from death that she starts to question any of her actions, but by then, it's way too late.</span>

Time will tell if they overcome said flaw, or - tragically - don't.
<ul><li> Theo, the protaganist is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a>, and an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">Optimist</a>, which, while allowing him to be very charismatic and friendly, also causes him to underestimate the possible danger some situations can hold. It's hinted that this optimism is a self - made "defense mechanism", as he's horrified of death (or anything to do with it), and uses this to try and avoid confronting said fear.
</li><li> Katrina, the main heroine of the comic, comes across as a very friendly and outgoing young girl, but has deep problems with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">depression</a> due to... whatever happened to her.

</li><li> Violet, a young and slightly unhinged girl is definitely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, and has serious problems dealing with anger and self - worth. She's been known to go into a sort of martial frenzy, losing complete control of herself and attacking whatever is nearby, friend or foe. Most of the other characters, even her <em>boyfriend</em>, are scared of her. It's been hinted her worst fear is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">killing her loved ones</a> due to this instability, and shuts herself out from the world because of this.
</li><li> Akila, Katrina's best friend (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">and possible lover</a>) is too seductive and flirtatious for her own good, and also has serious issues with self - worth. She's the only non - human character in the comic, and therefore feels nobody will truly love her for who she is, causing her to overcompensate and flirt with everyone, causing it hard for people she truly does love to notice her affections.

Granville's lack of supervision combined with his brain damage has driven him to complete his goals, no matter how dangerous or who gets hurt in the process.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>, Catra's biggest problem is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">an overwhelming sense of jealousy</a>. Her obsession with control, the past, and her inability to understand the responsibility she holds in her own life all stem from being jealous of someone else. On numerous occasions, she's given the opportunity to change, and fails to do so because of perceived slights towards her.
<ul><li> In the first season, despite having a flashback of all their good times as childhood friends, Catra still turns her back on Adora, leaving her to die. Catra does this because if Adora is gone, it will mean Shadow Weaver will have to favor Catra instead.
</li><li> Throughout the third season, Catra consistently makes things worse for herself out of jealousy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Catra lies that Entrapta is betraying the Horde, getting Entrapta sent to Beast Island. This actively hurts the Horde's plans, but Catra's jealousy over Entrapta getting close to Hordak means she doesn't care. Scorpia's suggestion that they live in peace in the wastes is ignored the second Catra believes Shadow Weaver joined up with Adora. Even in a reality where Adora offers Catra the chance to escape the Horde before becoming She-Ra, Catra still chooses to insist that Adora is abandoning her. Later in the same episode, Catra is willing to destroy the universe, herself included, just for the sake of beating Adora at <em>something</em></span>. Each time, Catra is offered opportunities to change, but blames others for her own mistakes and lets her long-held grudges ruin her senses.
</li><li> Maybe not as fatal as Catra's, but Entrapta's flaw is her overwhelming curiosity, combined with a complete disregard for consequences. As long as she can learn something, it really doesn't matter what happens. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She does have her limits, refusing to perform an experiment that might destabilize the universe, but before that, she had destabilized the climate of an entire planet and was perfectly willing to open the door for an invading army, just because she might get the chance to learn from them.</span>
</li><li> Hordak's biggest fatal flaw is tunnel vision. Hordak is so fixated on projects of immediate importance to him that he overlooks dangerous developments right under his nose. Notably, he failed to grasp the full implications of She-Ra's re-emergence, the power contained in her sword, or her ability to unite the Princess Alliance.
</li><li> Another one of his fatal flaws is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arrogance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arrogance">arrogance</a>. His arrogant attitude toward, and outright abuse of subordinates such as Catra and Shadow Weaver contributes to their disaffection, which has disastrous consequences for him. His arrogance toward the "inconsequential" Adora/She-Ra blinds him to the real threat she poses to the Horde.
</li><li> Adora's biggest flaw is that she can be too controlling - when she wants to keep someone safe, she instinctively tries to fence them in so they can't get hurt. It's a holdover from her abusive childhood, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">Shadow Weaver</a> would torture Catra and tell Adora it was her fault for not keeping Catra under control. It does a real number on some of her most important relationships, especially since she doesn't really have the emotional intelligence to realize that she's doing it: Catra views Adora protecting her and telling her that she should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">change sides</a> to get away from Shadow Weaver as attempts to put her back in Adora's shadow, while Glimmer in season 4 takes Adora's actions as attempts to usurp her authority.

<ul><li> Iroh's bizarre Fatal Flaw is his love of tea. While normally the wisest and more sensible figure in the entire series, he makes some monumental mistakes when around the stuff. Once, when having to hide his identity as a Fire Bender, he used his bending to heat up some cold tea and nearly blew his cover. Earlier than that, when finding a plant whose leaves were either the world's most refreshing tea or pure poison, he ground it up and drank it due to temptation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It was poison.</span>
</li><li> Azula is another example, as she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">psychopath</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist">perfectionist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParanoiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParanoiac">paranoiac tendencies</a>. She simply sees people as objects &#151; she manipulates them and expects them to behave accordingly. But she can't handle <em>not</em> being in control of everything. Her belief that people can be controlled through fear flew in her face, and her determination <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">to prove herself to her father</a>, mainly because she believed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that her mother only cared for Zuko, proved to be a serious issue that led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> at the end of the series. And when Mai and Ty Lee, the people she thought she had the most control over, turn against her, the shell cracks off the nut, and her relatively subdued madness comes to the forefront and turns into full-blown paranoia, leading her to banish, well, everyone around her for imagined slights and plots against her.

When she runs into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jet after he had betrayed her trust</span>, she immediately attacked him.

She gets better, at least. Bolin, meanwhile, repeatedly gets himself into trouble through his trusting nature which stemmed from Mako's overprotective nature. Mako's inability to spit anything out or relax for four seconds never gets him into any worse trouble than a difficult breakup. It's really a blessing that Asami doesn't have this trope that it enables her to keep their group together. Lin Beifong has trouble letting go of old resentments that she ends up hurting others who aren't even part of her resentment like her niece Opal, not so dissimilar to Katara as mentioned above. Tenzin can be surprisingly naive for a middle aged man and has to learn not to compare himself to his father.

When battling Vaatu, she dismissively told Wan not the meddle in their affairs, whereas Vaatu was smart enough to manipulate Wan into helping him. While she chided Wan for his mistake, she also contributed to that said mistake as well due of her dismissive nature preventing her to explain to the first Avatar why freeing Vaatu was a bad thing, which enabled the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> to manipulate him.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> have many examples.

</li><li> Goliath's flaw is his anger and need for revenge, especially if someone in his clan is hurt.

<ul><li> Courtney's flaw is pride. She expects others to follow her unquestioningly, gets dangerously angry when they don't, and is constantly trying to elevate her social status. This has led to her downfall in every season she's in.
<ul><li> Pride is actually a very common fatal flaw in Total Drama. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Heather</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jo</a> refuse to play nice because of it, and both are mostly disliked by their peers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbJock">Lightning</a> frequently makes bad decisions because of his arrogance, and it turns his team against him in season five. And then there&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Justin,</a> who has a tendency to limit his participation to avoid ruining his appearance. Topher thinks he can take over Chris&#146;s role as host, and lets his team lose when he thinks he has. While Harold was never really done in by his, it generally did him no favors with his team. And while pride was arguably not Sugar&#146;s biggest flaw, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">it was the one that got her eliminated in the end.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Sierra's flaw is her obsessive nature. Aside from her stalking of Cody, she idolizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Chris</a> (and the show itself) leading her to trust him blindly.
</li><li> Dawn&#146;s fatal flaw is her social ineptitude, which is ironic for an empath.

</li><li> Noah's flaw is apathy. He won't work with his team to win, and generally doesn't care about anyone's feelings &mdash; which, combined with his sharp tongue, led to him being voted off.
</li><li> Duncan&#146;s rebellious nature got him eliminated twice, and the second time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he got arrested for blowing up Chris&#146;s mansion.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Eva&#146;s</a> fatal flaw is her temper. She has a tendency to react violently to the slightest of offenses, and was voted out twice for being unstable.

</li><li> Every single Pines family member in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> has at least one critical flaw that tends to kickstart the conflict of the stories:
<ul><li> Dipper's flaw is his insecurity; Dipper has done some very stupid and very dangerous things in an effort to prove himself, such as reciting a curse <em>out loud</em> in an attempt to be taken seriously by federal agents. In addition, these insecurities have given Dipper something of a defeatist mentality, which impairs his ability to fight back in difficult circumstances.
</li><li> For Mabel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">her selfishness</a> meant that she often never considers what everyone else wants and instead, prefers that they do what she wanted to do. She is also shown to be quite insensitive to Dipper's feelings as despite the fact that she knows that Dipper is troubled, she still constantly picks on him. This flaw is what ultimately caused a rift between the two and allowed Bill to exploit her emotional state in order to directly cause Weirdmageddon.
</li><li> Stan has three; First, his issues with trusting and confiding in others, which comes back to bite him in <em>Not What He Seems</em>. Second, his temper, which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> cost Ford his dream scholarship and almost doomed the entire world when Ford corrected his grammar, prompting Stan to attack him, thus breaking up a magic circle that would have destroyed Bill</span>. Third, similar to Mabel, is his selfishness and his obliviousness to it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Part of the reason he and Ford had a falling out was Stan assuming that the latter would be comfortable with not going to his dream college and feeling threatened when he realized Ford was seriously thinking about it.</span>
</li><li> The Author (aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stanford Pines</span>) lets his obsession with his own work and science drives away everyone he cares about including his brother and Fiddleford. He is also <em>really</em> bad at just explaining things, usually due to trust issues or lack of communication skills. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Among other things this leads to his assistant leaving and going mad, a fight with his brother that gets him sucked into another dimension for about thirty years, only trusting one person with world-saving secrets, and being part of a chain of events that kicks off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch">Weirdmageddon</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most obvious Fatal Flaw is Eddy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>. Much of the driving force in many episodes is Eddy trying to scam other kids out of their money so he can gets his hands on jawbreakers (or just keep it for himself). Many of Eddy's schemes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">would be legitimate business ventures if he applied himself</a>. The trouble is that Eddy's obsession with making as much money as possible keeps ensuring that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a> for him.
<ul><li> Eddy's impulsiveness is also a recurring issue for him - when he wants something, he wants it <em>right now</em> and will chase after it with little regard for the consequences.
</li></ul></li><li> Double D's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">spinelessness</a> means that he's often dragged along with Eddy and Ed's shenanigans whether he wants to or not and his inability to assert himself with his friends or the neighbourhood kids often results in him being punished alongside Eddy and Ed even when he was innocent and/or tried to stop the other two. He also has a bad habit of letting his reputation of the smartest kid in the cul-de-sac go to his head at times and he <em>has</em> to be right about everything, making him quite inflexible and not good at bouncing back when things backfire on him.
</li><li> Ed's stupidity is his flaw, since he's very gullible, prone to making mistakes and often doesn't understand what's going on, often meaning that more short-tempered characters like Eddy or Sarah take their anger out on him or him getting manipulated easily.
</li><li> Sarah's Fatal Flaw is Wrath. There is rarely an episode where she isn't either yelling at someone or beating them up, and the other kids in the cul-de-sac rarely help her as a result.
</li><li> Kevin's is arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>, being an arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> who likes to think he's the coolest guy around.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">Kanker</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">Sisters</a>, who all fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lust">Lust</a>, as their habit of subjecting the Eds to unwanted kisses and affection actually just terrifies them and drives them further away.
</li><li> Jimmy's childishness mean that he's an easy target for bullies (especially when Sarah isn't around) and he's often dismissed and patronised even when he does have legitimate concerns or opinions
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel">I Am Weasel</a></em> has severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a> which sometimes makes things worse for the world rather than better.

Not helping things is that Nigel is completely unaware of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> status and thus is extremely belligerent towards him. Eventually, the situation deteriorates and all the pent-up resentment culminates in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a> between them, which Chad loses</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>: Helga Pataki's primary flaw is insecurity.

Arnold would likely return her affections if she were to stop treating him like garbage and be herself.

<ul><li> Jack's patience is legendary, but more often than not he allows his frustration to boil over with disastrous results. Specific incidents include getting so infuriated at a constant stream of bounty hunters that Aku was able to create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a> of him to fight, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> lashing out in a blind rage after Aku destroyed the last known time portal in existence and then mutated the sheep that had helped him find the portal.

Given that Aku is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of evil, it's only natural that he suffers from this. Many of his schemes fail because he has no understanding of the concept of good. This trope is why him sending Jack to the future backfired. He'd expected a world ruled by him would allow him to crush Jack effortlessly when he arrived.

And in the series finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his execution of Jack fails because he couldn't comprehend that rather than being crushed by this, the ones Jack inspired would come to his aid en masse.</span> Later on in the same episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he finally meets his end because he never believed his daughter Ashi could free herself from his control, letting her use his powers he awakened in her to take Jack back to the past and kill him.</span>
</li><li> Additionally, other things that are lost on him are "respect" and "teamwork", as he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a> to the highest degree and has actually screwed himself over time and again because he cannot help but betray his allies in some form or another, even when he's trying really hard not to.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em> has Carver, whose desperation to be cool often leads him to making terrible decisions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>: The eponymous character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATragedyofImpulsiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATragedyofImpulsiveness">impulsiveness</a>, which leads her to say or do things without considering what the consequences of her actions might be, particularly when Adrien is involved. This has not only driven a wedge between her and her friends, such as in <em>Rogercop</em>, but it has also caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">a substantial number of akumatizations</a> that otherwise could have been avoided, such as in <em>Gamer</em>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em>, Sean's fatal flaw is that he fears cramped spaces, heights, and gets space-sick easily, but he must overcome these fears in time so he can achieve his dream of being an astronaut when gets older. He was also somewhat of a neurotic, overconfident perfectionist in the early episodes, but he gets better later on.
<ul><li> Jet's fatal flaw is his impulsivity. He tends to act before thinking, and this has caused trouble for him and his friends a few times throughout the show. He is also terrible at keeping the secret that he is an alien.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Steven's main flaw is his self-sacrificing nature; he tries to take everyone's burdens on himself, even when it's obviously burning him out. This is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em>.
</li><li> Connie keeps secrets and assumes that other people's reactions would be more negative than they are.
</li><li> Pearl has absolutely <em>no</em> self-esteem and depends on her relationships with others to feel good about herself. For most of her life, she was dependent on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyAndKnight">Lady and Knight</a> relationship with Rose, to the point where she couldn't accept her relationship with Greg or her decision to have Steven. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She later almost completely ruins her relationship with Garnet by lying to her in order to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusing</a>, since as a fusion with Garnet she got to feel Garnet's self-confidence.</span>
</li><li> Amethyst also has no self-esteem, but in a different way. Her origin as a defective Gem from one of the Homeworld Kindergartens means that she thinks of herself as being a parasite on Earth, and she has little confidence in her own strength.
</li><li> Garnet is an odd case, since she's a Fusion and both Ruby and Sapphire have their own. Ruby's is her hot-headedness and singleminded focus on the present, to the point of not even trying to look for solutions to her problems. Sapphire's is her apathy and trust in her future vision; she is so invested in the future, she forgets that the problems she sees solved <em>haven't been solved yet</em>, and need her to act to fix them.
</li><li> Rose Quartz had her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion">Condescending Compassion</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocent Insensitivity</a>; while she really <em>was</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>, she had no idea how deep that particular rabbit hole went. She didn't understand that humans could love on equal terms with Gems until Greg confronted her, and she was particularly bad at understanding how others felt, especially towards her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Some of this presumably came from being so isolated as Pink Diamond.</span>
</li><li> Blue and Yellow Diamond have opposite flaws; Yellow Diamond represses her emotions to the point that they cause her to act irrationally when they get too much, while Blue Diamond lets her emotions distract her from both her duties and from finding peace. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> White Diamond holds everyone to impossible standards of perfection, including herself.</span>
</li><li> Pink Diamond's flaw was her immaturity. She was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy">No Respect Gem</a> among the Diamonds, and her frustration led her to throwing tantrums to just get some attention from her sisters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She later grew out of it, but into others- see Rose's entry above.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Two fatal flaws are exposed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeamoSupremo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeamoSupremo">Teamo Supremo</a></em>. Mr. Paulson admits to being too trusting. He tried to give his former lab assistant Crawford a second chance after he served his sentence for his villainous rampage as "the Gauntlet", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFarmerAndTheViper">only for Crawford to backstab Paulson and steal the Mega Gauntlets again.</a> Paulson then reveals Crawford's flaw, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">his temper</a>. He joins the team in confronting the Gauntlet and taunts him until, in a fit of rage, he <em>hands the Mega Gauntlets over to Teamo Supremo</em> so he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">fight Paulson himself</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a></em> is built around this. Each season focuses on a new passenger of the eponymous train, who can only leave when they've resolved a notable personality flaw.
<ul><li> Season one has Tulip. Her issue is a general unwillingness to work through her feelings, preferring to bury them rather than accept imperfection and move on.
</li><li> Season two has Jesse. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">wants people to like him</a> so much that he won't take sides, lets people walk all over him or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicFriendInfluence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicFriendInfluence">talk him into doing things</a> that he knows are wrong.
</li><li> Season three has Grace and Simon. Grace's pride is what led to her starting the Apex to begin with because she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> couldn't own up to the fact that she didn't actually know what the numbers meant, and only wanted recognition</span>. Meanwhile, Simon's obsessive nature means that once he gets an idea into his head, <em>nothing</em> will convince him to reexamine it or consider he may not have all the information, which actively contributes to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">worst</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">character</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEpiphany">traits</a>.
