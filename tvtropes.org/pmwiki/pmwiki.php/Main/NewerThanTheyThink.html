Yet,...in its modern form it is the product of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 'Traditions' which appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented."</em>
<div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Eric Hobsbawm</strong>, <em>The Invention of Tradition</em>
</div></div><p>So you've run across a trope or story element that seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook">unspeakably old</a>. It simply drips with antiquity and grandeur, so you assume that it must have been around since the first caveman. But then you research it a little more, and discover...that it was invented by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a> advertising executive in 1989?

It usually arises from the myth being tied into an older myth; or the assumption that because the mythology is <em>old</em>, it hasn't been <em>changed</em>. Sometimes the trope really <em>is</em> as old as they think, but it's only become popular within recent historical memory.
</p><p>It may also tie into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreDifferent">Our Monsters Are Different</a>, as many "standard rules" seem like they should come from folklore and legends, but really come from more recent media. The development of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">fantasy RPGs</a> has been a major mover in both tropes, as RPG creators have freely raided, adapted and bastardized from folklore and literature in order to fill their manuals, scenario books and bestiaries.

<ul><li> Camels weren't introduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> until fairly late in the New Kingdom, and then only as a source of milk, meat, and hair, not as beasts of burden or riding animals.
<ul><li> Camels didn't make it to the Maghreb until about 300... <em>AD</em>. Try to tell that to all those strategy games that give camel units to Carthage during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Punic Wars</a>!
</li><li> Camels, and their relatives the llamas, did not arrive in the Old World and South America until a mere 2-3 million years ago. For context, they had been living in North America for about 40 million years already!
</li></ul></li><li> Plains Natives are always shown in movies riding horses. However, the native North American horse had gone extinct long before Europeans arrived and was never domesticated. The horses the natives acquired later came from European horses that had escaped, were stolen in raids, or purchased from Europeans.
<ul><li> When Spanish explorers first encountered the Plains Natives in the 16th century, said Natives were using sled dogs for transport.
</li><li> <em>Sid Meier's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Colonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Colonization">Colonization</a></em> gets this right, only giving the Natives mounted units when they've acquired horses from the Europeans.
</li><li> Even when horses are correctly portrayed as being introduced by Europeans, they are often assumed to have passed to the Natives almost as soon as contact happened. In reality the spread of the horse in the American West and the Great Plains was kickstarted by the Pueblo Revolt against the Spanish in 1680 and happened largely through the 18th century. The Iroquois acquired horses independently from the British or French around the 1690s, and the Mapuche in South America were the first to raise their own cavalry between the 1560s and 1590s (baring some sporadic use by the Incas in the 1530s revolt).
</li></ul></li><li> Horses weren't present in the Middle East either until the second millennium BC, when they were introduced by invading peoples from the Eurasian steppes to the north. Both the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations developed without horses (although they had donkeys).
</li><li> Although the dog has been domesticated for tens of thousands of years, a recent study determined that only 14 out of 85 tested breeds are thought to be "ancient breeds" or what we call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. (There are over 300 known dog breeds, so more extensive testing might reveal additional ancient breeds.) The idea of registered, pedigreed, "purebred" dogs is an innovation of the 19th century; most breeds did not become closed breeding pools until the 1800s. Many breeds did not even exist until recently; for example, German Shepherds were first recognized as a breed in 1899.
<ul><li> Many dog breeds are even newer than that; the English Bulldog we're familiar with wasn't developed until after the turn of the century; the modern Poodle has origins that go back centuries but the current look is a 20th century development; the oldest modern Labrador Retriever was born in 1899 and the subtypes weren't established until the 1930s.
</li><li> The breeds in question: Afghan Hound, Akita Inu, Alaskan Malamute, Basenji, Chow Chow, Lhasa Apso, Pekingese, Saluki, Samoyed, Shar Pei, Shiba Inu, Shih Tzu, Siberian Husky, and Tibetan Terrier. All of these have genetic structures that resemble wolves to a marked degree.
</li><li> Three breeds that have ancient histories, the Norwegian Elkhound, Pharaoh Hound and Ibizan Hound, did not turn out to have ancient DNA structure. Not surprising, since these three breeds were close to extinction and were "recreated" by breeding the few remaining individuals with other breeds, thus diluting their DNA. Other breeds that have long histories, such as Greyhounds, were extensively crossbred in the 1800s and have lost their original DNA structure.
</li><li> However, at this point it cannot be said that any dog breed is more or less closely related to wolves than any other. All of the tested breeds seem to derive from the same small number of domestication events.
<ul><li> Dingos may actually be the one of oldest "breeds" of dogs, although they were not tested in this study.
</li><li> New Guinea's singing dog probably predates even the dingo.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Because marsupials use a reproductive strategy that is popularly regarded as "primitive", kangaroos are often assumed to be an ancient genus on par with "living fossils". In fact, the larger, grazing varieties of 'roo only arose about five million years ago, evolving from the wallabies which preceded them <em>more</em> recently than our own lineage split off from that of chimpanzees.
<ul><li> It's the same with monotremes &mdash; while the platypus is indeed a living fossil and the oldest living mammal family, echidnas only evolved in the Oligocene, <em>after</em> most of the more advanced groups of mammals, like primates.
</li></ul></li><li> That rabbit that is found everywhere in Europe and a pest in Australia was originally an endemism of the Iberian Peninsula. The Romans, who introduced it in other places for hunting purposes, didn't even have a specific word for "rabbit" (see below), using terms like "small hare" or "digging hare" instead. The first domestic rabbits appeared only in the Middle Ages.
<ul><li> "Rabbit" was originally the word for the young of the species. The general word for the species (and if you know <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, or early translations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, you have encountered it) was "coney" (which probably comes from the Spanish "conejo", which in turn derives from the Iberian "cunic&#365;lus"). "Coney" rhymes with "honey". This particular term evolved into the modern "bunny" and then was quietly forgotten, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">reasons you might be able to guess</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Rats were not always living in nearly every part of the world, and were not always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">looked down upon</a>. The most familiar species, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName">Norway rat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">came from northern China</a> into Europe near the end of the Black Death. It was the Indochinese black rat that came first, in the 1st century.
</li><li> Pheasants were introduced in Europe from Central Asia in the Middle Ages, and later into North America.
</li><li> Barring Hanno's account (whose <em>gorillai</em> might or might not have been real gorillas, despite inspiring their name) and a few other dubious reports from Portuguese Angola, the gorilla was not known outside Africa until 1847, roughly two centuries after the first chimps and orangutans had been brought to Europe. This makes the presence of gorilla-like creatures in pre-19th-century fiction (Caliban in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em>, for example) very interesting indeed.
<ul><li> Related to this, the efforts to put a barrier between the words "monkey" on one hand and "ape" and "simian" on the other are a late 20th century phenomenon. For the longest time "monkey", "ape" and "simian" were used interchangeably. All three were probably used first to name the same creature, the Barbary "ape" <em>Macaca sylvanus</em>, a tail-less species of macaque from North Africa.
</li></ul></li><li> The sea otter was not discovered until the late 1700s.
</li><li> Pandas were unknown to Western civilization until 1869, when Lazarist missionary Armand David became the first to record them in the annals of European science. Interestingly, the animal seems to have been highly obscure even in China until this point; no artwork depicting pandas predates the Western discovery of the species.
</li><li> Hyenas were obscure animals in the Western world until the mid-20th century. As late as 1922's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a></em>, filmmakers could substitute hyenas for wolves and audiences would be none the wiser. In reality, hyenas are feliforms rather than caniforms (meaning that, for all intents and purposes, they're cats rather than dogs).
</li><li> Amphibians weren't considered a separate taxon from reptiles until 1825&#150;or rather, <em>reptiles</em> were not distinct from <em>amphibians</em>. Amphibia is the older name.
</li><li> Authors that want to be a little clever in their historical British tales, may use the red kite rather than falcons or eagles as symbols of untamed wilderness. However, the red kite was historically an over-populous urban bird, playing the role pigeons and gulls play today. The Tudor-era Vermin Act began the extirpation of the bird until it was reduced to a tiny population clinging to the remotest parts of Wales, hence its wilderness image. Researchers reintroduced the kite rurally, only to discover the population is moving back into the urban environment just as the historical writings describe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Megalodon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Megalodon">Megalodon</a> is often shown coexisting with and going extinct along with the dinosaurs, even in works which carefully avoid making the same mistake with other popular Cenozoic creatures like mammoths and sabre-tooth cats. In reality, the giant shark first evolved around 15.9 million years ago, almost 40 million years after the dinosaurs died, and died out about 2.6 million years ago &mdash; <em>after</em> the evolution of bipedal apes (but before that of true humans).
</li><li> While grasses were around at least as early as 120 million years ago, they didn't become the widespread, ubiquitous lifeform they are today, or in any familiar forms, existing only in small pockets or so until the very end of the Cretaceous period. Thus, any depictions of the Mezosoic with grass all over the ground would be anachronistic, unless it's shortly before that famous meteor that killed off the dinosaurs.
<ul><li> Flowering plants didn't exist at all until the Cretaceous, far succeeding the dinosaurs, who first appeared 100 million years earlier during the Late Triassic. <em>Seed plants</em> (which includes conifers and cycads, in addition to angiosperms) have existed for longer (and the whole Plantae kingdom even longer), but not flowering plants. Stegosaurs and Brachiosaurs had all died out before there was even a thing called grass.
</li></ul></li><li> Keeping hamsters as pets is a relatively recent thing. Golden Hamsters were discovered in 1839 and they started being used as lab animals in the 1930s. Hamster domestication thus dates back to the 1930s at earliest.
</li><li> Domestic cats have been bred for thousand of years, but most breeds are relatively new. For example, the Sphynx dates back to the 1960s (and the two main lines date back only to 1975 and 1978) and the modern Persian dates back to the 1800s.
</li><li> Hedgehogs were first tamed in the 1980s. (And in many countries, the idea of hedgehogs as pets is still preposterous.)
</li><li> A lot of dog and cat breeds looked radically different as little as 100 years ago. Bull Terriers didn't gain their signature egg-shaped heads until the early 1900s, Dachshunds had longer legs in the 1800s, and many short-muzzled dogs had much longer muzzles two centuries ago. This also applies to cats to a degree. The commonplace flat-faced Persian dates back to attempts to produce red-furred Persians in the 1960s (and they were still almost unheard-of until the mid-1990s).
</li><li> The association of monkeys with bananas was popularized in the 1970s by naturalist Jane Gooddall, who was widely depicted offering them to the apes she studied. In reality, monkeys do not have a particular preference for bananas, but enjoy anything sweet; additionally, the bananas associated with monkeys are invariably <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana">Cavendish bananas<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which do not exist in the wild and have only been widely sold since the 1950s.
<ul><li> In a similar vein, carrots weren't associated with rabbits until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> started eating them in 1940 (cabbage was). Originally, his eating carrots and saying "What's up, doc?" were both references to a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItHappenedOneNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItHappenedOneNight">It Happened One Night</a></em> (1934) where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClarkGable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClarkGable">Clark Gable</a> does the same thing.
</li></ul></li><li> Most earthworms in North America are not native but accidentally introduced in the 18th century and after, and have strongly altered the ecology of forests as they've migrated westward.
</li><li> Cat litter (and, by extension, the litter box) was invented in 1947 by American businessman Ed Lowe.
</li><li> Although popularly considered to be living fossils that have been unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, modern-type crocodilians only appeared near the end of the Late Cretaceous and modern genera appeared millions of years after that (during the Eocene, when most modern mammals and bird groups were also appearing). The niche of "riverine ambush predator" was also actually just one of many occupied by them back in prehistoric times; the very last fully terrestrial forms only died out about <em>three-thousand</em> years ago.
</li><li> The Earth itself has only been habitable by humans (and all other extant life on this planet) for about half of its existence, the Great Oxygenation Event which filled our atmosphere with breathable air taking place approximately 2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago, spurred on by the evolution of photosynthesis in <em>one</em> specific group of bacteria (the cyanobacteria, which still exist - and thrive - to this day)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0myso');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0myso" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0myso');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and as far as we know, photosynthesis only ever evolved once - hundreds of millions of years ago, a primordial eukaryotic proto-plant attempted to consume a cyanobacterium but it instead became the first <em>chloroplast</em>, the organelle which is the means by which all plants photosynthesize</span>. Any time traveler going back three billion years to learn the origin of life had better take a spacesuit or they would suffocate and die in minutes.
</li><li> When pop-culture wants to represent the evolution of reptiles (312 million years ago) as the definitive independence of vertebrates from the waters, they'll show frog-like eggs turning into hard, mineralized eggs like chicken eggs. But such hard egg shells are exclusive of archosaurs (the group that includes dinosaurs, crocodiles, and birds among others), which only appeared 250 million years ago. Other reptiles like lizards, snakes, and turtles (and also <em>mammals</em> like the platypus) lay eggs with impermeable, but soft and elastic shells.

<ul><li> Rodin's Thinker sculpture was made in 1902.
</li><li> <em>Washington Crossing the Delaware</em> is one of the most popular depictions of the American Revolution, though it was actually completed by Emanuel Leutze in 1851, 75 years after the event.
</li><li> The "tradition" of the diamond engagement ring is sometimes thought to have been the result of a 1940s de Beers ad campaign, but this is not the case. The tradition actually began decades earlier, in the immediate post-World War I era; an expensive ring was intended as insurance that the man actually meant to marry the woman, and wasn't proposing just to get sex (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> at a time when single women had literally no access to birth control and unmarried mothers were thought of as worse than street whores). De Beers merely piggybacked onto a trend that was almost universal by the time their first ads ran. They did however create the idea that an engagement ring should cost two months' salary&mdash; apparently a perversion of the long-standing rule of thumb that a house should cost two <em>years</em>' salary.
<ul><li> As well, most of the ideas surrounding the ring were at the very least played up and at the worst invented whole-cloth by De Beers' advertisers over the succeeding decades. See the idea that the size of the rock matters, the idea that selling or trading in an old engagement ring is bad luck, etc. Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> is De Beers completely making up the "rule of thumb" that a ring should cost the man two months' salary (in an effort to make it impossible to have one standard-sized ring that was "good enough").
<ul><li> Not to mention the idea that you should be buried with your diamond jewelry, in order to destroy the second hand diamond market and prop up the artificial scarcity.
</li><li> Before that time a common engagement gift &mdash; not necessarily a ring &mdash; was acrostic jewellery: where the initials of the set gems spelled out words or names. REGARDS rings (Ruby, Emerald, Garnet, Amethyst, Ruby, Diamond, Sapphire) are acrostic jewellery, for example, although many rarer and unusual stones are required to fill other letters. Actual <em>wedding</em> bands, however, have reportedly been around since the Medieval period.
</li><li> De Beers' real achievement was "a diamond is forever". This advertising campaign effectively destroyed (OK, vastly reduced) the supply of second-hand diamonds, which helped them keep their prices high.
</li><li> They have also managed to smash Adam Smith's "invisible hand" by artificially inflating the rarity of diamonds. In fact, diamonds are not as rare as most people believe, but the companies making up the de Beers consortium weren't willing to let market forces and competition reduce their profit margins. Good luck trying to explain it to people, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Wedding bands have existed for centuries, but of course weren't as common back when the masses could barely afford shoes and food, never mind gold rings. Rather than being symbols of eternal blah-blah-blah, they also symbolised exchange of wealth in return for marriage. One English account gives "with this ring I thee wed" followed by the words 'This gold and silver I give thee', at which point the groom was supposed to hand a leather purse filled with gold and silver coins to the bride. The unromantic Germans record the phrase "I give you this ring as a sign of the marriage which has been promised between us, provided your father gives with you a marriage portion of 1,000 Reichsthalers." In the 1920s, only 15% of marriages were two-ring affairs, men's wedding bands being slow to catch on.
</li><li> In Russia, since the 15th century, iron wedding bands were often used for one of the sides. And in Judaism (Orthodox, at least), a rabbi will not agree to oversee a wedding with a gemmed band present &mdash; since it symbolizes the exchange of wealth, there should be no possibility of the value being unclear. As a variation of this trope, the use of rings to symbolize the exchange actually came from Rome &mdash; hence the groom's specifying that the wedding is according to the law of Moses.
</li><li> Historically simple rings (i.e. wedding bands) in the early middle ages and were given as a symbol to seal an engagement among Germanic peoples. The bride accepted the ring to signify that she had been properly 'bought' and engaged.
</li></ul></li><li> Most people consider the tradition of birth stones to be rooted in history, maybe derived from Western astrology or Jewish mysticism (alluding to the 12-jeweled breastplate of Israelite priests). The tradition actually dates from a Tiffany &amp; Co. pamphlet from 1870 to encourage the sale of more "obscure" gems.
</li><li> The name <em>Art Deco</em> for the 1920s and 1930s design movement was popularised in the 1960s. In the 1930s people usually called it the <em>Moderne</em> style.
</li><li> The name <em>Gothic</em> for the 12th-to-15th century style of architecture and art was coined ca. 1550 by Giorgio Vasari as a pejorative name &mdash; he considered the "maniera de' Goti" barbaric. At the time Gothic cathedrals etc. were built, the style was called "opus francigenum" (French work/style) or "pointy-arched style".
</li><li> The Russian nesting doll, the <em>matryoshka</em>, was invented in 1890. (The painting styles were based on much older paintings. The nesting doll idea is based on an older Japanese toy).
</li><li> Most chalk hill figures in England are post-Medieval and many were carved in the 20th century. One of the most famous, the Cerne Abbas giant, often associated with ancient pagan religion and magic, seems to have been carved sometime in the 17th century. It's been suggested it was originally a caricature of Oliver Cromwell.
</li><li> Chauvet Cave, one of the pinnacles of Paleolithic art in Europe, was discovered on December 18, 1994. That's 54 years after Lascaux and 115 years after Altamira.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chronology&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Minutes and seconds as we know them were first used near the end of the tenth century. (The names are a clue: <em>minute</em> fraction of an hour, and <em>second</em> minute fraction; "thirds" and "fourths" were once used in calculations, although not measured for obvious reasons.) Before that, the only culture <em>not</em> to use fractions of an hour was the Babylonians, who would divide <em>days</em> by sixtieths, into units of twenty-four minutes, twenty-four seconds, six fifteenths of a second, etc. Seconds could not be measured until the sixteenth century, and nothing resembling our concept of counting time by seconds shows up until late in the seventeenth.
</li><li> The AD dating system was not devised until AD 532, and not widely used until the 9th century AD. Before that, Christians often dated from the supposed date of the Creation (5492 BC), the supposed birth of Abraham (2016 BC), and many other epochs.
<ul><li> If they dated years that way at all: many just used terms like "the 18th year in the reign of King Whatshisface". (This convention was commonly used in dating British legislation until quite late in the reign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a>, and remained part of the official legal citation form until <em>1963</em>.)
<ul><li> Still the case in some countries, e.g. Japan, where official calendars refer to the era name; since 1868 a calendar era coincides with the reign of an emperor, but before then they were shorter, new eras often being declared for recovery from major disasters. The current era (beginning in 2019) is Reiwa, the reign of Emperor Naruhito.
</li><li> Legislation is also still numbered by regnal year in Canada; thus Canadian statutes passed in 2015 are dated to the 64th year of the reign of Elizabeth II. (It's slightly more complicated than that, as statutes are dated to the session of Parliament, which generally spans two calendar years, but that's enough of that now.)
</li><li> In some regions of Europe historians continued to use AUC or other Roman chronologies <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16crw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16crw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16crw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, the "Spanish Era" in the Iberian Peninsula, which began in 38 BC when the region was declared pacified by Augustus</span> well into the 14th and even 15th centuries. It's ironic that this practice died precisely during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a>.
</li><li> It is also sometimes stated the Ancient Greeks counted the years by the Olympic Games. In reality, this system was only used since the 4th Century BC, and then only by historians. Any official documents used years <em>named</em> after officials, with each state, naturally, having its own calendar.
</li><li> Fun fact: The earliest event which we can date with any certainty is the Battle of Halys (May 28, 585 BC), which was called off due to a solar eclipse (which is how we know it was on May 28th).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> New Year's Day, until a few centuries ago, could fall on a number of different days depending on the country, most commonly March 25th and September 1st. Great Britain didn't move New Year's to January until 1752, concurrent with its adoption of the Gregorian Calendar.
</li><li> The concept of decade as a unit of time (and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">associated tropes</a>) did not exist until the 20th century, and was only popularized by a 1931 book by Frederick Lewis Allen. Until then, periods of time shorter than a century but longer than a year, would be expressed in ages, eras or periods, but not decades. The word itself could just as easily mean ten <em>days</em> - and in many languages still does.
</li><li> The idea of date changing in the midnight was coined only in the 18th century. Before that, <em>sunset</em> was considered to be the time of the change of the date. The sunset as date change is still followed by observant Jews and some Christian sects. For Romans and Greeks, it could start as sunrise. Also, the day and the night were each divided into twelve hours separately, making for different lengths depending on the season.
</li><li> The Chinese adopted the twelve hour day only in the 18th century. Before that, they used decimal reckoning. They considered the twelve hour day as a <em>retrograde</em> step.

<ul><li> Batman's iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingHookPistol">Grappling-Hook Pistol</a> originated in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">movie in 1989</a>, before being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCanon">brought over into the comics</a>.
</li><li> The iconic look of Gotham City (perpetually dark skies, gargoyles everywhere, crumbling infrastructure, old-school buildings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarrchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bizarrchitecture">Bizarrchitecture</a> in general) is similarly a creation of the film &mdash; specifically of production designer Anton Furst. The look was brought into the comics in a largely forgotten 1992 storyline involving an insane architect; prior to then, Gotham mostly looked like a normal city.
</li><li> Nowadays seemingly everyone pictures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieSuperheroesWearBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieSuperheroesWearBlack">Batman wearing black</a>, but this wasn't always the case. While his cape and cowl were midnight blue as early as 1939, they lightened to powder blue in subsequent decades and remained that color even as the comic became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> between the 1970s and the '90s. Equally more striking is the prevalence of the light gray bodysuit, which was replaced on film by the all-black suit in 1989 but continued to appear in the comics until the mid-'90s &mdash; and even then, the suit was sometimes colored charcoal gray rather than black, and the cape and cowl could still appear with blue highlights.
</li><li> The general depiction of Batman as a grim, violent character inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">Gothic Horror</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> is a pretty recent idea, and it never really took off in the comics until the mid-1980s at the earliest. Even in the 1940s, when Batman made his debut in a feature in a noir/mystery anthology, his stories had plenty of campy and silly elements, which only got more pronounced in the Silver Age. And even after stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> helped popularize the more serious approach to the character, writers still regularly used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">camp</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">darkly humorous</a> effect.
</li><li> The idea that all of Batman's villains are varying degrees of insane is fairly young, as well. Arkham Asylum wasn't introduced until 1974 and wasn't consistently called that until 1979. It wasn't really associated with Batman's rogues then, either; most of them were either regular crimelords or traditional supervillains. As late as 1986's Who's Who, only a handful of villains were listed as Arkham residents (Joker, Two-Face, Mad Hatter, Maxie Zeus, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Floronic Man</a>). The idea seems to have been codified by a mix of the Post-Crisis era giving writers carte blanche to redesign villains into more deranged figures, and the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a></em>.
<ul><li> For that matter, Arkham wasn't even confirmed to be in the neighborhood of Gotham City until about 1980. In its first appearance it's only stated to be in New England (although that raises a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">whole other can of worms</a>)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> himself was not always portrayed as being insane. He was at one point or another interested in profit and was often arrested and put in jail. A 1950s comic story '<a class="urllink" href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_Vol_1_74">The Crazy Crime Clown<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>' even had him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">feign insanity</a>! It's been argued that the first time the Joker was truly written as insane was in the "Laughing Fish" story, where he was seemingly incapable of understanding that he couldn't copyright a mutated fish, which was published in <em>1978</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> We all know that Bruce Wayne is the head of Wayne Enterprises, right? Except Wayne Enterprises first appeared in 1979, after Batman had already been around for forty years. Prior to the company's introduction, Bruce presented himself more as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleRich">Idle Rich</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> than the reclusive but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestCorporateExecutive">Honest Corporate Executive</a> we're familiar with today (for that matter, Lucius Fox, who is almost essential nowadays, debuted in the same issue as the company).

</li><li> Batman being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">Nay-Theist</a> or atheist hasn't always been a part of the character. As late as the mid-80s he made references to God. Plus there is him saying "God Almighty" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanUnderTheRedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanUnderTheRedHood">Batman: Under the Red Hood</a></em>. That's 2010.

She actually disappeared from comics all together between 1954-1966 because the editors at DC thought she was too sexy to get past the comics code.
</li><li> Today, it is virtually impossible to think of Alfred as being anything other than one of the most important characters in the Batman mythos - the man who raised Bruce Wayne after his parent's death, his surrogate father and his closest friend and confidant. It's unheard of for any serious Batman adaptation today to exclude Alfred, even if it excludes characters like the Joker and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a>. But the contemporary concept of Alfred having raised Bruce only originated in Frank Miller's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>, published in 1987 - nearly a <em>half-century</em> after Batman debuted! Alfred himself didn't make his debut in the comics until 1943 (five years after Batman's debut), in a story where he meets Bruce for the first time when he's an adult well into his career as Batman, with Robin already by his side. This remained his backstory for the next forty-plus years

<ul><li> Smallville being Clark Kent's hometown is not itself an example of this trope having been established since 1949... but its location being in Kansas was only confirmed as canon in <em>1986</em>. Previously the comics located it anywhere from the Midwest to the East Coast (several stories from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> have it as relatively near the ocean).

In 1985, DC killed the character and attempted to replace her several times with little success, finally reintroducing a modern Kara Zor-El in 2004.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, upon his first appearance in 1970, was strictly a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a></em> character, and generally kept his nose out of the core DCU. His power was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">ambiguous (though clearly vast)</a>, and he preferred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> to fisticuffs. The modern conception of him as the DCU's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and an enemy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> in particular didn't occur until 1982, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> used him as the main villain of <em>The Great Darkness Saga</em>, and 1996, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> drew on the fact that Darkseid technically debuted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a></em> to establish him as one of the few villains capable of matching Superman blow-for-blow.
</li><li> Superman originally fought for "truth and justice", with "the American way" only added in 1951 for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">The Adventures of Superman</a> TV series.
</li></ul></li><li> Clark Kent and Lois Lane have only been married in the main universe since 1997, half a century after they were created.
</li><li> Peppermint Patty and Marcie are among the most famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> characters, but while the strip was created in 1950 Patty didn't appear in it until 1966, and Marcie made her debut in 1971. Neither of them were in the two most famous <em>Peanuts</em> specials, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsTheGreatPumpkinCharlieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsTheGreatPumpkinCharlieBrown">It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a></em>.
</li><li> Even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> debuted in the 1960s, many of the elements people associate with the character, such as the Dora Milaje, his arsenal of advanced Wakandan gadgetry, and his vibranium-laced costume, did not exist until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherPriestComics">Christopher Priest</a>'s iconic run during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.

</li><li> The idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> as the overall leader of the superhero community in the Marvel Universe is relatively recent, dating from the publication of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars (1984)</a>. Before that, Cap wasn't even a frequent leader of the Avengers themselves - the role more often went to Iron Man and Thor. The only exception being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CapsKookyQuartet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CapsKookyQuartet">Cap's Kooky Quartet</a>, but even then he only gets to lead a team of novice (at the time) Avengers.
</li><li> Being a movie franchise based on a comics franchise dating back many decades, you'd be surprised that a lot of elements in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> are relatively recent additions to the comics, usually going back to 2001 or so at the earliest.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JessicaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JessicaJones">Jessica Jones</a> wasn't made until 2001, unlike the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">Defenders</a> who have many decades of history under their belt.

Though, she isn't Silk in this version, not <em>yet</em> at least. Even the other students have been around for many decades.
</li><li> The Black Order, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNameChange">Children of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a>, were created in 2013. The same goes for the Outriders from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> are both Newer <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink">Older than You Think</a>. On one hand, the modern incarnation of the team was formed in 2008, about <em>six</em> years before the team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">movie</a> came out. On the other hand, most of the characters from the movie were created in the 1960s and 1970s, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Groot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Groot">Groot</a> debuting in November 1960, <em>a full year</em> before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, who began the modern Marvel Universe (it wasn't even a superhero comic at all; <em>I Challenged Groot, The Monster From Planet X!</em> was from Marvel's classic monster/horror imprint <em>Tales to Astonish</em>). In addition, the title of the comic was first used in 1969, but that incarnation was <em>very</em> different from the one audiences are most familiar with.
</li><li> Black Panther's costume being able to absorb kinetic energy and redistribute it as explosive bursts was an idea introduced in Ta-Nehisi Coates' <em>Black Panther</em> run a mere <em>two years</em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther">the movie</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52">New 52</a> has had a major impact on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a> and DC's various TV shows and video games:
<ul><li> As mentioned elsewhere on the page, things like Harley Quinn being a core member of the Suicide Squad and Deadshot having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a> daughter originated in the 2011 <em>Suicide Squad</em> reboot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Katana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Katana">Katana</a>'s costume was also based on her look from the New 52 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em> series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> being a demigoddess and the daughter of Zeus was an idea taken from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianAzzarello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianAzzarello">Brian Azzarello</a>'s controversial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderWoman2011">2011 run</a>, written a mere six years before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">the movie</a>.
</li><li> The live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> movie and the animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueWar">Justice League: War</a></em> are both based on Geoff Johns' 2011 New 52 origin, with the team first coming together to repel an invasion from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Darkseid">Apokolips</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, most modern adaptations featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a> (including the movies, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice</a></em> games and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJusticeRevivalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJusticeRevivalSeries">Young Justice: Outsiders</a></em>) tend to follow the New 52 origin, where Victor's cybernetic body parts are Apokoliptian technology rather than something built by his father. Cyborg being a core part of the Justice League is also taken from the New 52 run, as prior to this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a> was traditionally the team's seventh founding member.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em> movie is very heavily based on the New 52 run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>, with elements like Black Manta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">wanting revenge for the death of his father</a> and Queen Atlanna being Ocean Master's mother standing out as major examples.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam">Shazam</a></em> is a straight up adaptation of the New 52 origin story, right down to the inclusion of Billy's foster siblings Darla, Eugene and Pedro, who didn't even <em>exist</em> in the comics until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>.
</li><li> The New 52 <em>Harley Quinn</em> series by Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner was a major influence on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a></em> animated series and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a></em> movie.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackLightning">Black Lightning</a></em> TV series heavily features the title character's daughters Anissa and Jennifer, who were created in 2003 and 1996, respectively.
</li><li> The infamous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, I command you to&mdash; WANK!" panel is commonly assumed to be a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">Have a Gay Old Time</a>, much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s "boner" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>. It actually comes from <em>Captain America #366</em>, published in 1990.
</li><li> Susan Storm being called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InvisibleWoman">Invisible Woman</a> started in 1985, a full 24 years after her first appearance, whereas beforehand she was the Invisible Girl. Nowadays, it's almost impossible to imagine her codename as anything <em>but</em> that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a> is an iconic part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>'s backstory, but originally, he wasn't from there. In his Golden Age appearances, Aquaman was merely the unnamed son of a human scientist who had experimented on him to allow him to survive underwater. Aquaman's ties to Atlantis, as well as his real name ("Arthur Curry") weren't established until a full <em>18 years later</em>.
</li><li> The idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Barbara Gordon</a> are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> has become such a staple amongst comic fans that it can be surprising to learn that it wasn't a thing until the 1990s. Prior to that they were portrayed as much more platonic, and Barbara was several years older than Dick. Their romance started due to disputes on whether Nightwing was more of a <em>Teen Titans</em> or <em>Batman</em> character. This caused Nightwing to split up with Starfire and be put with Oracle. The love triangle started even later, when an issue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> Dick into having cheated on Starfire during their engagement..
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> did not always have her famous Canary Cry. In fact, the cry didn't start appearing until over 20 years after she first became a character. The "Canary" in her name has nothing to do with superpowers. The original Black Canary was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> until 1969. It's the <em>second</em> Black Canary, her daughter, who has always had the cry.
</li><li> Ask a non-comic book reader to name members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a>, and they'll likely name Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and... Harley Quinn? Actually, while the former two are regulars of the squad, Harley Quinn was never a member until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> relaunch in <em>2011</em>. Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuicideSquad2016">the 2016 movie</a>, she's now quite possibly the most well-known member of the Squad, showing up in nearly every subsequent film (both live-action <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanAssaultOnArkham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanAssaultOnArkham">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuicideSquadHellToPay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuicideSquadHellToPay">animated</a>), TV show and video game featuring the team. Prior to this, it was the far lesser-known character Nightshade who was arguably the team's most prominent female member (other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AmandaWaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AmandaWaller">Amanda Waller</a>, of course).
</li><li> The notion of a comic strip creator typically being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">Reclusive Artist</a> really only began with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury">Garry Trudeau</a>, who shunned the limelight even as <em>Doonesbury</em> became a major phenomenon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. Before that, artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LilAbner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LilAbner">Al Capp</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Pogo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Pogo">Walt Kelly</a> were very much public figures who eagerly courted media attention. Capp actually had a brief stint as a TV game show host in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>. Even the famously shy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Charles Schulz</a> gave numerous interviews and even made on-camera appearances in the various <em>Peanuts</em> anniversary TV specials.

However, Zoe herself wasn't introduced until 2005, over fifty years after Deadshot was created (though he was barely used until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em> in 1987).

Despite this, they didn't become an item until the early 1970s. The original Black Canary's second and most important love interest was Larry Lance, who she married and who is the father of the second Black Canary.

</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> themselves avert this as they've been around since 1963, the idea that they're the premier superhero team of the Marvel Universe and the answer to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> is a relatively recent development. For much of its existence, the Avengers were <em>not</em> considered the big team of Marvel by either the writers or readers. In fact, they were seen as a dumping ground for characters that weren't popular enough to hold their own titles. Canonically, the greatest superhero team was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, while the most popular team for much of the '80s and '90s were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>. It wasn't until the '00s where the idea began to shift, as Marvel put an increasingly large amount of focus on them in the comics, and of course, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>'s tragic backstory as a Holocaust survivor is the character's defining aspect now, yet it was first established in <em>1981</em>, eighteen years after he was introduced. In fact, the issue, "I, Magneto...." was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">radical reinvention of the character</a>, who had mostly been a one-note evil megalomaniac until that point. The new direction stuck so well that nearly every adaptation uses his revised backstory, and he's been portrayed as varying flavors of antihero since then.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X-23</a> is very well-known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, but many would be surprised to learn that she debuted in the animated series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> in <em>2003</em>, and was quickly brought into the comics in 2004. Nowadays, it's hard to imagine the <em>X-Men</em> franchise without X-23, even though she was introduced 40 years after the franchise began.

Before that, many Sikh males volunteered for or were drafted into the military.
</li><li> The "tradition" of the white wedding dress originated in 1840, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> of Britain wore a white satin gown to her wedding. Before then, a rich bride would wear a gown that could be blue (like the Virgin Mary), red (the most popular choice before Queen Victoria), purple, or any other color, and was embroidered and brocaded with white and silver threading. A poorer bride might choose her best Sunday dress if she couldn't manage that. Although Vicky wasn't the first royal to wear white (as it was considered a very conservative and prudish color before then, as well as the color of mourning) she made it immensely popular, and women around the country styled it to be the color that emphasized girlish purity and innocence. At the time, white clothes couldn't be cleaned easily if stained, so wearing a white dress was like saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">"I can afford a dress that will be completely ruined if someone touched me with so much as an dirty hand."</a> Until more commercial methods of cleaning and laundering became available, white was the upper-class choice. After then, everyone could dress like a princess or a duchess by wearing white.
<ul><li> In Sweden the traditional color for a wedding dress was black. That didn't change until the 1920s.
</li><li> White was the primary color of wedding gowns in the early 1800s, although probably owing to the fact that evening gowns of that era were also primarily white. Silver was sometimes used, especially after the wedding of Princess Caroline of Wales in 1816.
<ul><li> In fact a younger woman's best clothes, if she were comfortably off, would almost always be white in this period, and probably made of fine cotton. A poorer (but not so poor she owned only work clothes) woman's 'Sunday' clothes would still usually be pastels or print-on-pastels.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">Mink was colored only brown (and possibly black)</a> until the mid 20th century, when breeding brought out mutation colors, like white and silver. If you see a woman wearing white mink in fiction before the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">1940s</a>, either the costumer didn't know the facts about mink, or they didn't have the time or budget to use white ermine, which is what would have been worn.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMeansFeminine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMeansFeminine">Pink</a> and blue weren't always considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy">"girl" and "boy" colors</a>, and the other way around was acceptable until recently. Until the 1920s there was no association between pink and any gender &mdash; at least not in the US. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen">Little Women</a></em>, Meg's twins are distinguished by colored ribbons: "Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French fashion".
</li><li> Cassocks were not historically the traditional streetwear of Catholic priests in the United States, even before the Second Vatican Council. They were worn during liturgical or sacramental functions(typically as an undergarment) but not in public for fear of anti-Catholic reprisal in the 19th and early 20th Centuries (unlike in most of the rest of the world, where cassocks were widely worn in and out of church). The black frock coat with collar was worn as streetwear in the US instead. Cassocks didn't become common streetwear for priests in the US until the New Liturgical Movement in the 1990s, yet period pieces set in the US before the 1960s or so often show priests in cassocks.
</li><li> While the kilt in its general form is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">one of the oldest known garments in human history</a>, the <em>Scottish</em> kilt is a pretty recent invention:
<ul><li> The clans of Scotland all being identified with a particular tartan is an idea that only stems back to the beginning of the 19th century, and originated in <em>Victorian England</em>, not Scotland. Its use in Scotland is an example of back-adoption. Scotsmen didn't wear kilts until the 16th century, well after the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">Braveheart</a></em>: William Wallace's men wore saffron, not plaid. Now <em>that</em> would have been a movie!
</li><li> The Scottish kilt developed over a period of about 200 years, from a simple cloak made from a single length of wool cloth which started out wrapped, then belted, then gathered, then finally pleated about the waist. There is also evidence that this style of dress did not, in fact, originate in Scotland, but was adopted from Norse invaders (who formed the primary genetic origin for the Highland Scots).
</li><li> Tartan plaids developed in the early to mid 16th century, and did not become common until the late 18th century. Prior to this, plaids were symbols of wealth (the ability to afford the widest range of dyes, particularly blue dyes, and more complex and labour-intensive patterns), and the most common colours for cloaks and kilts were saffron and brown. Even as the tartan patterns were developed, most people who wore them couldn't afford to keep them pristine, and the dyes available were usually neither long-lasting nor lightfast. You didn't look at the specific colors to work out what it was, you looked at the width and pattern of the stripes, and the relative brightness and color values secondarily.
</li><li> Or rather, kilts standing for the <em>whole</em> of Scotland is Newer than they Think. Before the battle of Culloden, 'Highland Dress' was associated with, yes, Highlanders &mdash; the Catholic, Gaelic-speaking, tribal(ish) part of Scotland &mdash; who were <em>despised</em> by the English-speaking, Presbyterian, city-dwelling, breech-wearing lowland Scots. Hence the fact that the force beating the Highlanders at Culloden had far more men from this community than Englishmen. Only 50 years after the real Highland culture had been almost comprehensively trampled was it resurrected in a sentimentalised form and identified with by the whole country.
<ul><li> Even the "resurrection" of Highland culture did not originate in Scotland, but rather as a fad after George IV's visit in Scotland and later in the Victorian era, as part of a larger obsession with the idealized image of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savage</a>" (which the Highland Scots epitomized in their view).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Corsets: although similar undergarments had been worn since the late Middle Ages, up until the late 18th century they were distinctly conical in shape and only extended below the waist with separated tabs. This was replaced by a lightly boned style, designed primarily for lifting the bust, during the Classical/Regency era. The hip-hugging, waist-reducing style most commonly associated with the word "corset" nowadays was only developed in the mid-19th century when narrow waists and wide skirts came back to fashion. And the word itself was only introduced to English around that time, the traditional word being "stays" (which incidentally some people continued to use well after corsets stopped being commonly worn).
</li><li> The first black belts for Judo were awarded in the 1880s. The colored belt system of rank found in most modern martial arts was founded during the 20th century. This was due to a large number of injuries that was occurring during sparring. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">The different colored belts meant that you could tell who was at what level of skill in a single glance.</a>
</li><li> The <em>gi</em> uniform and its variants which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsUniform">associated with martial arts</a> was not created until the early 20th century for use in Judo.
</li><li> Underpants:
<ul><li> Panties as we know them were only invented a bit over a century ago. While there are some examples of women's underpants from the 16th century, women's dress in most of Europe since antiquity had been an overdress over a shift, a long unfitted garment rather like a full-length nightie. Long drawers were first commonly worn in the 1850s; they had existed since circa 1800 but were considered rather racy (as, unlike the more conventional 'shift' they would have shown a faint outline of the wearer's <em>legs</em> through the fine fabric of the gowns of the period! However, a long version was adopted for little girls, so that they could wear a slightly shorter skirt.) Women started wearing them in the mid-nineteenth century because the new-fangled crinoline hoop had an embarrassing tendency to lift up in high winds, and so the wearer would be at least spared the embarrassment of revealing her legs. These drawers would have been open at the crotch (because it's extremely hard to pull them down to pee when you're wearing a hoop and corset) until about 1875, when the hoop was firmly out of fashion. And now you know why the can-can was considered obscene.
</li><li> Men's underpants appeared (or re-appeared, see below) at roughly the same era; before this, they would have had their shirts made long and loose, and wrapped the 'tails' round under their crotch- a shirt was essentially underwear, and all men would have worn something over it &mdash; in fact, a gentleman would only show the collar and cuffs, covering it with a cravat and a sleeved waistcoat (vest). Only in extreme cold weather would he have worn woolen drawers under his breeches. This is only part of the story, though; men wore underpants as early as in medieval times, but they seem to have fallen out of fashion with the extremely tight legwear of the late 18th century.
</li><li> And speaking of underwear: surprisingly, the thong wasn't invented until sometime between the mid 1970s and early 1980s, despite strippers having worn the similar G-string since time immemorial. In fact, it was a modern development of the loincloth which was mostly worn by men in ancient times.
</li></ul></li><li> As for the Vikings' horned/winged helmets, they were made up in the 19th century. See also below.
</li><li> Women's clothes did not have attached pockets until the late 18th century. Early women's "pockets" were separate garments tied to the waist beneath the skirt, accessed via a slit in the skirt (the nursery rhyme "Lucy Locket lost her pocket" is from this era). The narrow skirts of the Regency drove these bulky pockets out of fashion. This change also brought about another standard piece of feminine attire &mdash; the handbag, originally called a 'reticule' (sometimes spelled 'ridicule' for some reason). Prior to this, women had had no need of special bags &mdash; their pockets were surprisingly large (6" by 12", flat, but usually in pairs, seems to be quite standard- the heroine of <em>Pamela</em> practically fits a whole change of clothes into hers in an emergency), and if a female needed to carry anything bigger, a common woman could use a basket and a lady would use her servant.
<ul><li> While men had sewn-in pockets earlier, these still only date to the 17th century. Before that, the major innovation was having a vertical slit cut in the outer layer of clothing to allow access to a pouch worn inside, keeping it safe from cutpurses. Even this only dates to around the 13th century.
</li></ul></li><li> The classic cowboy hat commonly associated with the Old West didn't become prevalent in America until afterward (c. 1910s). The cowboy hat's design originated in Texas, influenced by the "Boss of the Plains" and Mexican-style hats which had a wide brim. In the 2010 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueGrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueGrit">True Grit</a></em>, only one character in the entire movie is seen with a cowboy hat, and he is from Texas.
<ul><li> Another classic piece of cowboy attire, the bolo tie, wasn't invented until the late 1940s. They're recent enough that the father of country music, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">Hank Williams</a>, was never photographed wearing one (he died in 1953).
</li><li> Not until near the end of the 19th century did cowboys begin to wear what are now thought of as cowboy boots. From the 1860s-1880s your typical cowboy boot was more like a generic leather wellington, with the distinctive features of the modern version such as Cuban heels becoming common piecemeal and slowly.
</li></ul></li><li> The bikini. Although the two-piece bathing suit has officially been around since the late 1940s (and earlier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoloresDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoloresDelRio">Dolores del R&iacute;o</a> had sported a <a class="urllink" href="http://ingegregusch.blogspot.com/2012/01/flying-down-to-rio.html">proto-bikini in<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>] 1933's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlyingDownToRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FlyingDownToRio">Flying Down to Rio</a></em>), for several decades it was regarded mainly as fetish appeal (since it is, after all, really nothing more than a bra and panties to be worn in the water) and was almost never sported by women who wished to be taken seriously, especially if they were athletes. (Surprisingly, it wasn't even until the 1990s that the bikini became standard in the Miss America pageant, and even then there was controversy over its inclusion.) Only within our own generation has the bikini become so ubiquitous than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> can wear one without fear of any but the horniest males leering at her.
</li><li> The zipper was invented by Gideon Sundback in December 1913 (though similar-style slide fasteners were patented by Whitcomb L. Judson in the 1890s). This means Victorian men could never have had their flies <em>down</em> but only <em>open</em>, since they only could have buttons before then. The fly itself is a modern development too: it was only introduced in Europe by the Turks in the 18th century, and for decades it was considered immoral in the West because it allowed men to have intercourse without undressing, and thus was considered to encourage rape.
<ul><li> It's impossible to know, but it seems less likely that he'd forget anyway, at least before the mid nineteenth century, as his fly (at least the part he'd open most often) would usually be horizontal, not vertical (that is, there would be a vertical opening at the waist, as now, to let him pull them on, and below it a sort of trapdoor/flap that could be lowered separately.)
</li></ul></li><li> So called traditional clothes of China (qipao) and Vietnam (ao dai) were actually introduced in the early 20th century. That's not to say they didn't exist before but the modern versions look wildly different from their predecessors.
<ul><li> The Chinese queue was introduced (and made mandatory) by the conquering Manchus in the 17th century. That's why it makes no sense to depict Chinese men with it in the Ming dynasty or earlier, unless the character is actually from Manchuria.
</li><li> Likewise, Han Chinese clothing prior to the Qing dynasty looked quite different, indeed more like Japanese clothing (which it influenced) to the modern eye.
</li></ul></li><li> The word <em>kimono</em> (literally "thing to wear") as used today dates to the mid-1800s and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MeijiRestoration">opening of Japan</a>. Previously, the garment was generally referred to as a <em>kosode</em>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4kfaf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4kfaf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4kfaf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lit. "small sleeve", for its wrist-sized sleeve opening</span> with several more specific terms applicable to certain variations in style.
</li><li> "Tie-dye" clothing is so commonly associated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">hippie subculture</a> (thanks to countless cartoons, Halloween costumes, and the like) that it can be surprising to learn that the fad didn't catch on in America until the late 1960s, by which point the hippie movement was beginning to fade away. <em>Real</em> hippies (as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretenderDiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretenderDiss">poseurs who wanted to dress the part</a>) usually wore much more drab (or at least solid) clothing, much as the beatniks had done. Furthermore, the tie-dye style, in general, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, having existed in various Asian cultures for centuries.
</li><li> Cut gemstones. The first records of successful attempts to cut them in facets came from the late Middle Ages. Prior to that gemstones <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Ardennenkreuz_%28croce_processionale%29%2C_francia_del_nord_o_germania_occ.le%2C_825-850_ca_02.JPG/800px-Ardennenkreuz_%28croce_processionale%29%2C_francia_del_nord_o_germania_occ.le%2C_825-850_ca_02.JPG">were polished<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. The round brilliant cut we are all familiar with first appeared in the 17th century at the French royal court.
</li><li> Modern-looking heeled shoes fitted to the left and right foot were rare and expensive prior to the mid-19th century. Before then, difficulties in the manufacturing of paired shoes with heels meant that most people wore shoes made on a straight last. When you first got them, either one would fit on either foot, although the leather would mold to your feet with wear. Before <em>that</em>, from about the 15th century back, paired shoes were more common, but would have had low or no heels.
</li><li> Although the earliest recorded usage of the word "supermodel" dates back to 1891 and was used on and off by the mainstream press since the 1940s, the use of "supermodel" to mean "a successful fashion model who has reached the status of a celebrity" only dates back to a 1967 <em>New York Times</em> article on English model <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Twiggy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Twiggy">Twiggy</a> (n&eacute;e Lesley Hornby) and was only popularized by an editorial for the January 1990 issue of the British edition of the fashion monthly <em>Vogue</em>, photographed by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLindbergh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLindbergh">Peter Lindbergh</a> and featuring Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyCrawford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyCrawford">Cindy Crawford</a>, and Christy Turlington.
</li><li> T-shirts in their current form as a slip-on, buttonless garment didn't exist until the 1900s. Wearing t-shirts without an overshirt didn't really catch on until after World War II. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AStreetcarNamedDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AStreetcarNamedDesire">Marlon Brando helped with that</a>.)

Adding "Part II" or "Part 3" is much older (e.g. Shakespeare's <em>The Second Part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV">Henry IV</a></em> or <em>Little Women, Part Second</em>; FC2 was the first to add just a number. And the use of Arabic numerals for the purpose is even newer: Roman numerals were more common until the (late) 1980s.
<ul><li> The "Kraut Western" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou">Winnetou</a> I</em> (1963) was followed by <em>Winnetou II</em> (1964) and <em>Winnetou III</em> (1965), but all three movies were based on Karl May <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Winnetou">novels of the same names</a>.

<ul><li> Princesses are among the most recognizable characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> studios' wheelhouse, but it hasn't always been that way. Of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">nineteen animated films</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> made during his lifetime, only three of them were "princess" films: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em> (1937), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em> (1950), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em> (1959). Walt felt that he had nothing else to contribute to the genre after <em>Snow White</em>, and wanted to spend his time working with other genres. He only made <em>Cinderella</em> because <em>Snow White</em> was popular and his studio really needed the money, and he made <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> because he felt that he could bring something different to the table (mainly, an adaptation that focused more on its villain and side characters than its main characters). After the latter&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">then-</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">tanking</a>, the Disney studios would not release another "princess" film until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">The Little Mermaid</a></em> (1989) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5uqgu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5uqgu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5uqgu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> an unconventional example in that the character filling the princess role wore hardly any clothes and in fact was not even human (and barely humanoid, at that) </span>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess">Disney Princess</a> franchise would not actually exist until 2000.
</li><li> Similarly, the concept of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">set lineup of Disney animated films</a> didn't exist until 1985.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Songs</a> are one of Disney's most beloved traditions today, but they didn't really become a staple of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a> until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGreatMouseDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGreatMouseDetective">The Great Mouse Detective</a></em> in 1986. Before Ratigan's "The World's Greatest Criminal Mind" set the standard, it simply wasn't common practice for the main antagonists of Disney films to wax lyrical about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">evil plans</a> and their most unsympathetic qualities - simply because most early Disney films only had a handful of musical numbers apiece, and the writers generally didn't feel the need to give <em>every</em> major character their own song. Sure, there are a few early movies with songs sung by antagonistic characters, but they were either extremely fleeting (like "The Elegant Captain Hook" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>, in which Captain Hook has barely 30 seconds of singing) or sung by minor characters (like "We Are Siamese If You Please" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></em>, which is sung by a pair of Siamese cats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">who come out of nowhere and are never seen again</a>).
</li><li> Disney musicals as we know them started in the 1980s with <em>Oliver &amp; Company</em> and especially <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. Their earlier films sparingly featured songs. Many of the songs were short, and most were sung in-universe (rather than being artistic interpretations of dialogue like in future films).
</li></ul></li><li> The popularized act of kissing the ring of a Mafia Don does not seem to have any basis in reality prior to the 1972 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em>. It is said that it was barely practiced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> even after that, except among posers. Kissing a bishop's ring or the Pope's Fisherman's Ring is a Catholic tradition called <em>baciamano</em> is (was) common among Catholics.
</li><li> Credits didn't usually come at the end of movies until the 1970s, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> generally seen as the first major movie to do so. Virtually all movies in the 1960s and earlier put most or all of their credits in the opening title sequence, which usually listed only the principal cast and the most prominent crew members (including the director, producer, and writer), though some also threw in a full cast list at the end. The modern practice of listing absolutely everyone involved with a movie's production only became standard in the 80s.
<ul><li> For animated projects, it wasn't common to properly credit the voice actors with their respective characters until around the early 90s, and it wasn't standard until maybe 2000. Before, most projects <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhichOneWasThatVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhichOneWasThatVoice">only listed the actors in alphabetical order</a>. In pre-1960s shorts, voice actors were rarely credited at all, unless they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc">Mel Blanc</a>.
</li><li> When the very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> was released in 1977, it was so controversial that the film didn't have opening credits. The Director's Guild of America let it slide for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> only because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">they thought it would tank in the box office</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouThoughtItWouldFail">It obviously didn't</a>, but despite this, when Lucas did it again for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> in 1980, he got a huge fine from the DGA, which he paid before he quit the guild altogether. Today, many filmmakers forgo traditional opening credits or even opening titles that now, it seems as though the DGA overreacted.
</li></ul></li><li> The now-ubiquitous practice of wide releases was pretty much invented by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em>. Before 1975, movies were treated more like road shows, released to a few theaters first, and gradually rolled out to the rest of the world for as long as they continued to be successful. This custom led to movies having much, much longer theatrical runs than they do today; a blockbuster like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em> could easily spend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">over a year on the big screen</a>, even before re-releases. <em>Jaws</em> bucked convention by instead releasing to thousands of theatres immediately; this strategy was so successful that the rest of the industry quickly followed suit.
</li><li> Prior to the mid-1960s, movie theatres didn't have showtimes, nor did people typically watch movies from start to finish in the way we're accustomed to. The standard experience was to simply "go to the movies", watch through all the reels shown that day&mdash;typically consisting of an A-movie, a B-movie, a few trailers, a cartoon, a newsreel, and a serial chapter or short subject (i.e. a documentary)&mdash;and then leave once it looped back around to where you came in (this is where the quip, "This is where I came in" originated). It was normal practice to walk in during the middle of a movie, watch to the end, and then back to the middle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em>, released in 1960, is generally credited as the movie that changed this practice, with Hitchcock requesting that no viewers be admitted to the movie after it had begun, so that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch">Halfway Plot Switch</a> could be a surprise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> shows were practically unheard of before the 1980s, due to FTC regulations against advertising to children, which were mostly repealed in the early 80s as part of Reagan-era deregulation initiatives. Before then, cartoons almost never had corresponding toylines and vice versa. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</a></em>, which debuted in 1983, is generally considered the first half-hour toy commercial.
</li><li> Elmo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> was a mere background character with no personality or voice, simply being an "extra red puppet" to fill out scenes when needed, until Kevin Clash first performed him in 1984.
</li><li> Many younger <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> fans are surprised to discover that the <em>Doctor Who</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> is only a 21st-century revival phenomenon. (There was one before in 1965, but at that time British TV didn't usually do "event" television at Christmas and broadcast whatever shows were normally scheduled with a Christmassy twist.)
<ul><li> There <em>were</em> Christmas broadcasts of the original <em>Doctor Who</em>, but they were neither Christmas-themed nor specially made; they were simply all six/four episodes of an existing story broadcast all together.

A full language wasn't created until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em>. It wouldn't have been possible for fans to learn Klingon until 1985 (<em>nineteen</em> years after the original series), when Dr. Marc Okrand published <em>The Klingon Dictionary</em>.

For most of the franchise's early history, it was just a highly successful series of Summer blockbusters that nearly <strong>everyone</strong> in America had seen, and even its most diehard fans couldn't claim to know more about the mythos than the average moviegoer&mdash;because there was no information about the mythos outside of the films themselves. This didn't really change until the late 1980s at the earliest, when the RPG sourcebooks from West End Games started to flesh out the universe with more details about the alien species and minor characters. And the fandom didn't <em>really</em> take off until the early 1990s, when Bantam published the first of their <em>Star Wars</em> novels (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">Thrawn Trilogy</a></em>) that actually continued the saga, creating a clear division between "casual fans" and "serious fans".

Rye <a class="urllink" href="http://jbr.me.uk/canon.html">points out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, very little of what that the franchise is famous for actually originated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, pretty much limited to the main cast (save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicSequelCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicSequelCharacter">Yoda, Lando and even Palpatine</a>), the Death Star, the concept of Jedi and the Force, and the name (but not the spelling) of the planet Alderaan. <em>Nothing</em> else was set in stone in 1977.

In fact, the poster's artist, Tom Jung, wasn't even born when the film first came out.
</li><li> Game shows revolving around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel">cooking contests</a> seem like they've been around forever, but the first one, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a></em>, came out in 1993 and didn't make it to the states until several years later.
<ul><li> The UK's <em>Masterchef</em> started in 1990, slightly pre-dating <em>Iron Chef</em> but still later than you'd think.
</li></ul></li><li> When most people think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th">Jason Voorhees</a>, they think of a man in a hockey mask going killing people with a machete. While it has slowly become common knowledge that he doesn't actually do any of the killing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980">the original film</a> (thanks largely to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996">Scream</a></em>), many people are still surprised to learn that he doesn't actually gain the hockey mask until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartIII">Part 3</a>. Even more surprising is the fact that the actor most associated with the role, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaneHodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaneHodder">Kane Hodder</a>, didn't actually play him until 1988, by which point there had already been 6 installments in the series.
</li><li> The now-ubiquitous practice of music specifically composed for television newscasts was started by Al Ham's <em>Move Closer to Your World</em>. Until then, newscasts had to rely on film soundtracks, library music or previously recorded popular or classical music (mostly instrumental) for their presentations. Case in point: arguably the most famous newscast theme of all time was <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/q0Jw02yOEr0?t=128">originally<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> part of the soundtrack for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolHandLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolHandLuke">Cool Hand Luke</a></em>.
</li><li> While the term "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>" was first used by a French film critic in 1946, the genre and its associated tropes remained largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">unbuilt</a> in Hollywood movies for a decade after that, and the term itself was virtually unknown in English until the 1970s. In particular, the now-stereotypical jazz soundtrack was unheard of in 1940s movies, and seems to have been only codified with the 1958 release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElevatorToTheGallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElevatorToTheGallows">Elevator to the Gallows</a></em> (a French film, by the way).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941">The Wolf Man</a></em> is generally seen as one of the "classic" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UniversalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UniversalHorror">Universal Horror</a> films, but it was actually one of the franchise's later efforts; it wasn't produced until 1941&mdash;a full decade after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff">Boris Karloff</a>'s turn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frankenstein1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frankenstein1931">Frankenstein</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BelaLugosi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BelaLugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>'s turn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931">Dracula</a></em>. It's also one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UniversalPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UniversalPictures">Universal Pictures</a>' few "classic" monster movies that wasn't based on a novel; while legends about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolves</a> date back to Ancient Rome, Lawrence Talbot (<em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">the</a></strong></em> werewolf) didn't exist until 1941. Notably, though, the film's central concept is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't Universal's first movie about werewolves; that was <em>The Werewolf</em> released in 1913, a now lost film.
<ul><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a></em> is often thought of as one of the classic Universal Horror monsters, and yet its first movie wasn't released until 1954, well after the franchise's heyday.
</li></ul></li><li> Although Marvel Comics adaptations go far back, Marvel co-creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> hadn't started making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheCameo/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TheCameo/StanLee">cameo appearances</a> in any adaptations till 1989's <em>The Trial Of The Incredible Hulk</em> (a TV movie sequel to the 1970s series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>), and he didn't have his first speaking appearance in a live-action adaptation till 2003's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hulk">Hulk</a></em>.
</li><li> Many shows that are remembered as having defined the decade in which they were produced came along very late in that decade, and often ran much longer into the subsequent decade:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>, remembered alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a></em> as iconic and emblematic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">'50s</a> television, didn't begin its run until 1957 - it premiered on the very day Sputnik launched. In fact, <em>I Love Lucy</em> had already ended its run earlier that year (and <em>The Honeymooners</em> the year before). The Korean War, <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the opening of Disneyland, and the breakthroughs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleRichard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleRichard">Little Richard</a> were all things of the past before <em>Leave it to Beaver</em> came on the air. The show continued to run until 1963, lasting longer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> than it had in the '50s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em> is considered almost quintessentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">'80s</a>, and it did <em>technically</em> premiere in 1989, but it continued to run until 1993, making it far more representative of the early years of that decade. Still, the show's garish set design, makeup, and costuming, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> dialogue, and the deliberately simplistic, cliched characterization and plots helped the show feel more "old-fashioned" especially in contrast to two <em>other</em> titans of pop culture which <em>also</em> premiered in 1989 but are definitively considered works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> One reason the 1983 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> finale is the highest-rated program in American history is that until then it wasn't common for TV shows, even long-running popular ones, to end with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. One exception was the 1967 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em>, which is also one of the highest-rated series finales ever.
</li><li> The word <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">"anime"</a> is first attested in English in 1985, and it didn't become the dominant term for Japanese animation until the late 1990s, before which it competed with other terms such as "Japanimation".
</li><li> Several moments from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> are newer than most people think.
<ul><li> The series only had 1 episode from 1989, the rest are 1990 or newer.
</li><li> The scene with Bart sleeping with Ms. Hoover in bed, seen on several "Didn't Understand As Kids" video was from SEASON 25.
</li><li> Several Smithers Gay jokes on said "Didn't Understand As Kids" lists have similar fates, with some clearly being from HD episodes.

<ul><li> A common cause of Newer Than They Think is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> lists as the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_effect">Pizza Effect<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, when a dish created by immigrants is back-adopted to their home country.
<ul><li> Named after the pizza, which was developed in the US by Italian immigrants as a variation of the <em>pizza margherita</em>, a simple flat bread known as <em>focaccia</em>, topped with olive oil, tomatoes, and cheese; which originated in Naples in the late 18th century, tomatoes having just been introduced from the New World. Prior to that, flatbread with olives and cheese was a common staple throughout the Mediterranean.
<ul><li> Modern pizza did not become popular in the US outside of Italian immigrant communities until after WWII, when American soldiers encountered the original Italian version.
</li><li> Pepperoni, the most popular topping on American pizza, was invented in the US in 1919, as a variant of the traditional Italian <em>salamino piccante</em> using locally available meat and peppers, and cheaper artificial casings.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur marketed as being the invention of a medieval hermit, cannot definitively be said to have been first produced earlier than 1980.
</li><li> The National Thanksgiving Turkey Pardon. While done intermittently since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman">Harry S Truman</a> in 1947 (including a 1987 incident where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> made his "pardon" as a joke during the height of the Iran-Contra scandal); it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a> that first made the pardon a regular event <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/holidays/thanksgiving/pardon.asp">in 1989<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> For that matter, the Thanksgiving feast itself looks like a tradition established by the Puritans, but it was neither a holiday nor a celebration of any sort until about 250 years later, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> declared Thanksgiving a national holiday and explained what people ought to do during that day.
</li></ul></li><li> Many "traditional" British foods actually only date back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, when rationing meant that people had to improvise new ways of cooking with only basic ingredients. Among the most enduring of these foods are carrot cake (with the bulk, moistness, and sweetness of the carrots helping reduce the need for expensive, rationed eggs, butter, flour and sugar), and apple crumble (a cheap substitute for apple pies).
<ul><li> Likewise, the "ploughman's lunch", supposedly the traditional midday meal of the hardy rustic English labourer, was invented in 1960 by the Milk Marketing Board in order to sell cheese.
<ul><li> That said, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, a similar meal is said to have existed prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The Ploughman's Lunch, as it was, may not have been an invention so much as a revival of something that disappeared due to rationing. Or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndustrialRevolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, when a lot of links to the countryside were severed and forgotten in the rush to the factories.
</li></ul></li><li> Recipes for traditional British puddings involving sugar or its byproducts (treacle, molasses) are likely no older than the 18th century, when imports from the West Indies made it available to those other than the very wealthy.
</li><li> Although roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and potatoes all have rather long histories in Britain (with the potatoes being the newest&mdash;no surprise, since potatoes only showed up in British cooking in the 18th century), the <em>combination</em> of the three for the Sunday roast was popularised in the late 19th century by Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales (the future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Edward VII</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> The Shopska salad, which is today internationally the most well known "traditional" Bulgarian dish, was in fact only invented in the 1960s by the Bulgarian tourist board (along with several other salads named after geographical regions, though only the one named after the Shopluk region around Sofia survived). Salads as a whole didn't really exist in Bulgarian cuisine before they had been imported from Western Europe a few decades earlier. Even one of its principal components (the tomato) didn't become popular in Bulgaria until the early 20th century.
</li><li> Lager was first made during the 16th century, could only be produced in large quantities in the 19th century (lager requires cold temperatures, which were hard to get before refrigeration), and didn't displace ale as the most common beer style until the 20th century. India pale ale has a similar history.
</li><li> The reputation of crappy American beer is a very recent one. Until World War I, U.S. beer was typically very good, not surprisingly considering most major brewers were of German or Dutch origin. Wartime grain rationing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DryCrusader">the Prohibition movement</a> resulted in the Wartime Prohibition Act, limiting beverage alcohol to no more than 2.75% alcohol content. After WWI ended and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties">Prohibition began</a>, many brewers went out of business. Those that survived could only produce "near beer", with an alcohol content capped at one-half of one percent. Franklin Roosevelt signed an amendment to the Volstead Act legalizing 3.2% beer, which became the common American beer strength. And then World War II came around, and rationing of grains caused many breweries to switch to half rice formulas which remained after the war.
<ul><li> Budweiser only became the "King of Beers" in the late 1950s, when a prolonged strike at the major Milwaukee breweries (including Pabst and Schlitz) enabled St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch to gain crucial market share, which it has held ever since. Budweiser itself originated as a Prohibition-era "near beer".
</li><li> The second-largest-selling U.S. brand, Miller Lite, didn't exist until 1973. And the biggest-selling U.S. brand, Bud Light, wasn't launched until 1982.
</li><li> Until the late 1960s, only premium beers were marketed nationally. The biggest seller in most markets was typically a local brand. This changed with the development of continuous-flow brewing (replacing the old "batch" method), which enabled the nationals to produce light beer cheaply enough to offset the shipping costs.
</li><li> The reputation springs from the US having expressed alcohol content by weight where other countries used a by volume system. This resulted in the same beer having a smaller percentage displayed by weight. This was changed fairly recently, but beer snobs haven't caught up.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, up until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Americans consumed more pork than beef. Pork prices were heavily subsidized by industrial use of lard. When vegetable oils became popular due to wartime rationing, pig farmers were forced to switch to leaner "bacon" breeds of pig. This is also why modern "cooked until well-done" pork has the consistency of shoe leather; there isn't enough fat to keep the meat moist.
<ul><li> Until the 19th century, the staple meat of Britain was actually bacon. Unlike cattle, pigs needed relatively little land (so, before the Industrial Revolution, more homes than not had room for one), and unlike hens, goats and cows they didn't contribute much (other than waste disposal) to the household while still alive, so most males would be slaughtered in the autumn when food started to run out. As for bacon, in the chilly climate of Britain (and before botulism evolved) it was quite easy to make (just bury your meat in salt for 5 days) and had a shelf-life of months.
</li></ul></li><li> Chicken was less common than pork or beef until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> shortages in the US.
<ul><li> In Iceland, chicken wasn't considered fit for human consumption until the 1960s.
</li><li> Actually, chicken was a luxury in most of the Western world until the introduction of intensive farming in the mid-20th century. The birds were kept for their eggs (in fact chickens seem to have been kept for centuries before anyone is known to have cooked and eaten one), and would only be slaughtered if they stopped laying- even a fairly wealthy farming family would eat chicken maybe once or twice a year (actually, typically they would eat one at Christmas and pay another to their land-lord as an agreed part of the rent), and it would probably be an old chicken to be stewed. Roasted or fried chickens need tender young birds.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of chicken, Buffalo wings date from no earlier than the mid-1960s; before then, chicken wings were seen as offal, fit only to feed to dogs or to use for broth. There are a few different claims as to who was the first to serve them in Buffalo, but none of them claim to have done so any earlier than 1964. They did not become a nationwide phenomenon until the 1990s.
</li><li> Gummi bears weren't widely available in America until the 1960s. (They were invented in Germany in the 1920s.) Gummi worms are even more recent, having only been invented in 1981.
</li><li> Fast food chains did not offer bacon cheeseburgers until 1992. Hardee's Frisco Burger was the first, and other chains quickly followed suit.
</li><li> Although recipes for Rice Krispies Treats date back to the 1930s, Kellogg's didn't start selling their own until 1995.
</li><li> Many fruits and vegetables have only existed in their modern forms for a few centuries.
<ul><li> The banana as we know it today was first grown in 1836; earlier bananas were tougher and starchier (essentially plantains), full of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inside_a_wild-type_banana.jpg">seeds<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> and unappetizing when eaten raw. Even then, bananas were almost unheard of in Europe until the late nineteenth century, to the point that Jules Verne, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays">Around the World in 80 Days</a></em> (1872), goes out of his way to introduce the banana to the reader in meticulous detail. The "Cavendish" banana, which comprises most bananas eaten today, only dates to the 1950s, when the then-prevalent Gros Michel banana became nearly extinct due to Panama disease, and may give way to "Goldfinger" bananas in the near future if the same blight ends up devastating Cavendish crops, as recent studies have indicated may happen.
<ul><li> Amusingly, the banana is neither an American or African crop, but actually comes from Southeast Asia. It was likely introduced in Africa by the Malays and cultivated limitedly by the Muslims on the Mediterranean coast before being introduced in the Canary Islands by the end of the Middle Ages. From there, the Spanish introduced it in the Caribbean in the early 16th century. It wasn't until the late 1800s when the Canarian banana became an export industry with its main market in Europe.
</li></ul></li><li> The modern-day strawberry was cross-bred in the early 18th century from varieties that would be unrecognizable to grocery shoppers today.
</li><li> The cranberry was imported to Western Europe from America in the early modern age, and its commercial cultivation only began in the 19th century. The wild species had been known and consumed in Eastern Europe long before though.
</li><li> Carrots were white, pink, red, purple, and yellow historically; orange carrots were deliberately bred in the Netherlands only in the 17th century, in honor of the Dutch royal family, which started with William I, Prince of Orange.
<ul><li> In that vein, the Dutch monarchy has only existed since 1815. The Netherlands were a republic from independence in the 16th century to Napoleon's granting its successor state, the Batavian republic, as a kingdom to his brother Louis. The princes of Orange were governors of Holland and Frisia and even then only semi-hereditarily.
</li></ul></li><li> The blueberry was first cultivated c. 1915 in Whitesbog, New Jersey, as an offshoot of the (often bitter) swamp huckleberry.
</li></ul></li><li> Chocolate chip cookies were invented in 1933 at the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts by chef Ruth Wakefield. There are conflicting reports as to whether she deliberately invented them, or she was trying to make chocolate cookies, but ran out of powdered chocolate, put small bits of chocolate which failed to melt into a uniform whole, and thus created the cookies by accident.
<ul><li> Speaking of chocolate, solid chocolate was formulated in 1847, before that it was only available as a drink. And before the invention of the conche in 1879, the solid stuff was generally sandy and hard, because there was no way to distribute the cocoa butter evenly throughout the mass.
</li></ul></li><li> Chicken Tikka Masala, widely thought of as the quintessential Indian dish and often assumed to be traditional, was invented in a curry restaurant somewhere in Britain around 1970. It was specifically tailored to British tastes, being milder and creamier than most other food from the Indian subcontinent.
<ul><li> Actually one story goes that it was improvised by a chef serving chicken 'tikka' &mdash; grilled chicken pieces, a more-or-less authentic Indian food &mdash; in a restaurant in Glasgow when a punter asked for some 'gravy' on them.
</li><li> In fact most curries- the kormas and rogan joshes- that make up the staple restaurant menu are not generally served in Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani households. Most did at least originate in India, but were developed by local cooks to be served to European colonists. Curry in Asia doesn't tend to conform to these names or recipes.
</li><li> The iconic vindaloo curry originated in Goa, as a localized version of a dish adopted from Portuguese traders. It originally was not even a curry, but a simple dish of pork marinated overnight in vinegar and spices, and roasted or stewed. What is commonly called vindaloo in the UK or US bears little resemblance to the original Goan version.
</li></ul></li><li> Fortune cookies, far from being a Chinese tradition, are based loosely on Japanese <em>omikuji senbei</em> (rice crackers with fortunes inside), and are thought to have been introduced at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> Exposition's Japanese Tea Garden (which still sells them today) around 1890. The cookies were thus originally associated with <em>Japanese</em> restaurants in California until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, when the Japanese-Americans of California were rounded up and sent to internment camps, leaving the Asian-restaurant field open to the Chinese and shutting down all of the fortune-cookie factories save one&mdash;one that happened to have a Chinese-American owner. Fortune cookies were never made or sold in China until the <em>19</em>90s. Even today, it is pretty unusual to find them at a restaurant in China, and they're usually sold as a novelty.
</li><li> Most of the Chinese cuisine available in US restaurants was either invented in the US during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, or are heavily altered from their original recipes to use local ingredients and suit western tastes. Indeed, American Chinese has evolved to become its own unique cuisine, distinct from any original Chinese styles or the various American influences.
<ul><li> Chop Suey was never seen in China prior to the 20th century, and is unknown there. It may have evolved from other dishes in different regions, but bears almost no resemblance to them.
</li><li> While there are certainly Chinese dishes made with ginger and beef, the ginger beef served at Chinese restaurants in the West was invented in Calgary in the mid-1970s.
</li><li> One of the most popular modern American Chinese dishes is General Tso's Chicken. There was a General Tso, who was a Qing Dynasty military leader born in Hunan province, and was reported to be fond of chicken. However, the first version of General Tso's Chicken originated in Taiwan, invented by Hunanese chef Peng Chang-kuei as a tangy stir-fried dish in the late 1960s. He moved to New York in 1973, and others adopted and modified his recipe. The original used plain chicken with skin, the skinless verions with crispy breading is typically credited to another Hunan chef, T. T. Wang, who worked in New York at the same time (his version was originally known as General Ching's chicken).
</li></ul></li><li> Tiramis&ugrave;, a very popular Italian dessert, was first made around 1982, although some place it around the 1960s-70s. Still, it's a lot newer than most people think.
</li><li> While it is true that whale meat has been consumed in Japan for centuries, it was generally regarded as a low-class, minority food, the preserve of coastal peasants. It only became prevalent across the country during WWII, when the government was forced to turn to whaling as a general food supply. And it was only much later, after many years of post-war shortages, that the people acquired a taste for it and made it popular.
<ul><li> However, whale meat is expensive and not sold as much, hence it's not really popular as a food in Japan anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> Like whale meat, the Japanese fixation with bluefin tuna is very recent. It was only in 1960s that the Japanese developed a serious taste for the big fish, after some businessmen had some in Canada.
<ul><li> Similarly, salmon didn't become a popular sushi ingredient until the 1990s, following a decade-long PR campaign by Norwegian salmon distributors.
</li></ul></li><li> People for the longest time simply did not eat lobster. In fact it was actively looked down upon, as they saw it as eating a bug (in fairness, lobsters are arthropods, so they're closer related to grasshoppers than they are any fish). Indentured servants in New England generally had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInMyContract">contractual protection</a> against being served lobster more than once a month. The only people that regularly ate them were prisoners, because people thought they deserved it. Having lobster shells outside your house was a sign of poverty. It only became acceptable and "trendy" to eat them in the 1880s with the advent of the railroads.
</li><li> Baileys Irish Cream. Ancient booze of the Celts, begorrah... invented in 1974 to get rid of a cream surplus.
</li><li> Mongolian Barbecue isn't even Mongolian. It was created in Taiwan in the 1970s and is more a stir fry than a barbecue anyway.
</li><li> The Greek dishes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodCuisine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodCuisine">most widely known to tourists</a> (e.g. Moussaka, Tzatziki and Souvlaki) are actually not exactly traditionally Greek&mdash;and also not exactly <em>not</em> traditionally Greek, either. You see, these dishes were not widely-known in what is now Greece until the early 20th century. However, they were widely prepared by ethnic Greeks living in Asia Minor, which was widely known to be a culinary melting pot, with a unique multiethnic cuisine formed out of it; the Greeks of Asia Minor tended to see the Greeks of Greece as being a bit backwoods and unsophisticated, as the land that is now modern Greece is in fact rather rough and was thoroughly outside the main sphere of Greek civilization for a surprisingly long period of time (since at least the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a>). This cuisine was brought to Greece by these ethnic Greeks in the "population exchanges" with Turkey <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7rvlt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7rvlt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7rvlt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In which by mutual agreement, Greece deported most of its ethnic Turkish and other Muslim population to Turkey and Turkey deported most of its ethnic Greek population to Greece.</span> in the 1920s. These dishes&mdash;which are the culinary equivalents of mutts, possibly with partial Greek ancestry&mdash;were mostly popularised by Nikolaos Tselementes, a renowned Greek chef of the same period.
</li><li> Although wines have been produced in the Champagne region of France since Roman times, the sparkling version only became popular in the 1700s, due to British influence (partly because the British loved them, also because the British had developed the glass technology to make the specialised bottles that don't explode [often- Champagne houses still lose up to 5% of their stock in transit this way] from the pressure of the champagne fizzing inside them). The bubbles were initially considered a wine fault (due to the lower temperatures relative to the Burgundy region, where their styles of grapes and production methods came from). Dom Perignon (yes, he's a real person) spent most of his life actually trying to get rid of the famous bubbles.
</li><li> Similarly, while wine has been cultivated in the upper Ebro basin in Spain since Roman times the production and exportation industry of the infamous Rioja wine brand as we know it was developed by French planters fleeing a plague that decimated the vineyards of Bourdeaux in the mid-19th century. The bulk of Spanish wine production had always been further to the south, in places like Jerez, Valdepe&ntilde;as or Malaga.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banoffee_pie">Banoffee pie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an English dessert, wasn't invented until 1972.
</li><li> Vana Tallinn (Estonian for "Old Tallinn") is a liqueur that is frequently believed to be a traditional or even ancient Estonian product, but it has only been produced since the 1960s.
</li><li> A great deal of traditional European food is based on potatoes &mdash; a New World vegetable. While known in Europe since the early 16th century, it didn't become a common food source for humans there until the 18th. Similarly, tomato, a New World vegetable/fruit, is commonly associated with Italian cuisine. The first recipe for pasta with tomatoes was printed in 1852.
<ul><li> Similar for paprika in Hungarian cuisine, which doesn't go back much more than 100 years, but without which Hungarian goulash is practically unthinkable nowadays.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> didn't have the Big Mac until 1968, the Quarter Pounder until 1972, nor Chicken McNuggets until <em>1983</em>. Even the Filet-O-Fish is older than their most famous sandwich!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8jkfc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8jkfc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8jkfc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">We should note that the Filet-O-Fish was a solution to a very specific problem: observant Catholics not coming in on Fridays (because everything substantial at Mickey D's back then involved what the Church considers "meat"). Since there are a <em>lot</em> of Catholics in America, and American Catholics in the '50s and '60s tended to actually observe the Church's official rules <em>every</em> Friday instead of just during Lent, not having a fish option took a serious bite out of McDonald's profits.</span> (By comparison, Burger King has had its similarly iconic Whopper since 1957.)
<ul><li> Also on the same note, McDonald's did not use drive-through windows until 1975. The first one was installed out of necessity near a military base in Arizona, as it allowed service to soldiers who were not allowed to exit their cars while in fatigues. (Drive-through fast food, however, dates from at least the 1950s.)
</li></ul></li><li> Dairy Queen did not sell the Blizzard until 1985.
</li><li> Microwave ovens weren't invented until the late 1940s, but they were very large and only really used for commercial purposes. Microwaves small enough to be used in a household kitchen were only introduced in 1967. And even <em>then,</em> they were prohibitively expensive for most people throughout the 70s and only really became a common household appliance in the first half of the 80s.
</li><li> The Caesar salad is thought by many people to have been invented as far back as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a> during the time of either Julius' or Augustus' reigns, but in fact, it was invented by an Italian entrepreneur named Cesare (Cesare being the Italian form of Caesar) Cardini during a shortage of kitchen supplies in a 1924 Fourth of July feast taking place in San Diego while working at Tijuana, Mexico, according to his daughter Rosa.
</li><li> Nachos, often thought of as a traditional Mexican food, have their origins in WWII when a restaurant owner in Piedras Negras named Nacho Anaya <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9vjsv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9vjsv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9vjsv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Nacho" is a common diminutive for "Ignacio"</span> found himself needing to serve a group of American military wives (whose husbands were stationed at a base in Texas) but didn't have much to work with thanks to war rationing and it being late. He created something he called "Nacho's especiales", and eventually the apostrophe disappeared and the name "nachos" stuck. Nachos were for decades made with solid cheese and nacho cheese as we know it today dates back only to 1976.
</li><li> Many in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> will insist that Cheez Whiz is the "traditional" form of cheese for that city's famous cheesesteak (for the uninitiated, that's a sandwich with thin-sliced chopped grilled steak on a long roll with cheese and, usually, onion). However, the cheesesteak is uniformly accepted among food historians to have been invented in the 1930s, while "wiz" (as it's called in Philly) only appeared in 1952, and the earliest record of its application to a cheesesteak comes from 1953. While not disputing that "wiz" is the most <em>common</em> cheese for a cheesesteak today, the original cheese was almost certainly provolone. To this day, wiz advocates and provolone advocates get into interminable arguments about this; common consensus is that while "wiz" is all right, "aficionados" go for the provolone (especially a locally-made sharp provolone if it's available). In towns near Philly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">processed American cheese</a> is common.
</li><li> While "vanilla bean" vanilla ice cream (vanilla with the "spent" beans sprinkled throughout, resulting in a "speckly" effect) isn't exactly popular on the mainstream level (though any sufficiently large supermarket will carry it), until the 1970s it was almost completely unknown in America outside the Mid-Atlantic states, having been created in Philadelphia's ice cream parlors. In fact, for decades prior to that tourists to Philadelphia from other cities would complain about being served "dirty" vanilla!
</li><li> The Frappuccino is a registered trademark of the Starbucks corporation, and didn't exist before 1995&mdash;but Starbucks made the drink so ubiquitous that several other coffee chains have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">tried to produce their own versions</a> under different names, resulting in some people assuming that it's been around longer than it really has. The drink is also based on a few older drinks&mdash;most notably the French <em>frapp&eacute;</em>, made from fruit juice and shaved or blended ice, from which it takes its name. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10hf0v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10hf0v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10hf0v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The name is a portmanteau of the French <em>frapp&eacute;</em> and the Italian <em>cappuccino</em>, presumably because it has the texture of a frapp&eacute; and the creaminess and caffeination of a cappuccino.</span> Amusingly, one of its many imitators is McDonalds' "frapp&eacute;", which is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">a Frappuccino in all but name</a>, but uses the name of an older drink that only vaguely resembled it.
</li><li> While certain concepts leading up to the energy drink have been around for a while (many caffeinated drinks promoted themselves as energy boosters since the late 19th century, and Dr. Enuf has been infused with vitamins since 1949), the overall concept as we know it now did not take off until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>. Red Bull first hit the US markets in 1997, and Monster in 2002. Even their spiritual predecessor, Jolt Cola, only dates from 1985, and Pepsi's first foray into the field with the guarana-infused Josta was in 1995. Similarly, energy shots were largely unknown until 5 Hour Energy popularized the idea in 2003. However, energy drinks and shots had already been popular in Asia for decades, such as Thailand's Krating Daeng in 1975 (which would be adapted internationally as its translated name, Red Bull), Korea's Bacchus-F in 1963, and Japan's Lipovitan in 1962.
</li><li> Cane/Table Sugar, as with many spices, was an expensive luxury import in Europe well into the Early Modern Period (approximately 1500-1800 CE). The main (and largely only) used sweetener for cakes and other foods before then was honey and whatever natural sugars were in the ingredients (such as fruit).
</li><li> That most iconic of French breads, the baguette. Though long bread was common in France at least as far back as the reign of Louis XIV, neither the term baguette nor the specific form we see today were used until 1920. Before then, if you told a Frenchman you wanted to make a sandwich with a baguette, he would wonder what sandwiches had to do with batons, and perhaps ask if you were a wizard and could make something more fancy with your magic wand.
<ul><li> Nobody's quite sure how or why "baguette" came to describe the current form&mdash;a long bread, 65-100 cm long, 5-6 cm in diameter, made from a specific kind of lean dough, and baked in a deck oven&mdash;but suspicion is generally cast on a 1919 law banning bakeries from employing bakers between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. This law, as a practical matter, meant that a bread that could be baked in 2-3 hours or less&mdash;before the morning rush for breakfast bread at about 7 a.m.&mdash;was needed, and the thin, long-but-not-too shape worked well under these constraints if you baked it in a deck oven and became standard. Presumably, once people began noticing that all the bread now looked like this, they started making joke names about them, of which calling them "batons" or "wands" of bread (<em>baguette</em> in French) stuck.
</li><li> Its "traditional" Italian counterpart, ciabatta bread, is even newer, dating to 1982.
</li></ul></li><li> While popcorn has been known for millennia (archaeologists have found traces of popcorn in Mexican sites 5,600 years old), it didn't become a popular snack in the U.S. until the late 19th century. Even then, it didn't really take off until the 1940s, when World War II sugar rations forced Americans to find alternatives to candy. It was also during World War II that popcorn began to be sold in movie theatres.
</li><li> Americans love french fries, but they didn't catch on until the 1920s. Thomas Jefferson introduced them in 1802, but they didn't become an American staple until soldiers came back home from Europe after World War I. Many loved European french fries and began making the dish themselves. French fries also received a big popularity boost in the 1950s and 1960s with the introduction of both frozen fries and McDonald's.
<ul><li> Despite the name, they did not even originate in France, but in (French-speaking) Belgium; where they were known as <em>pommes frites</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trdelnik">Trdeln&iacute;k<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, sold in particularly touristy places in the Czech Republic, often under the name "staro&#269;esk&yacute; trdeln&iacute;k" ("Old Czech"), is hardly Old Czech - it originates further East, and only started being sold widely in the Republic around the turn of the millennium.
</li><li> Ramen didn't exist at all in Japan until the early 20th century, when Chinese immigrants introduced it, and it didn't gain wide popularity among Japanese until the 1950s. Furthermore, instant noodles only date to 1958.
<ul><li> Ramen was first introduced to America with the debut of the Nissin Cup O' Noodles in 1973.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, takoyaki (balls of savoury pancake batter filled with a variety of fillings, most commonly minced octopus) is not a ancient Japanese snack, but was invented in 1935. Even then, the original variety was filled with braised beef, and the octopus-filled variety didn't appear until a year later.
</li><li> Sriracha sauce only dates back to the 1930s. The version of sriracha sauce that most Americans associate the flavor with was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-25455643">created in 1983<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in Los Angeles.
</li><li> There was a major ad campaign in the UK in 1997 for Werther's Originals that had an old man reminiscing about being given them as a child by his grandfather. As a result, they instantly entered the UK lexicon of "old people things" and most British people now vaguely assume they've been around for at least fifty years, if not since the Edwardian era. That advert was the first time they'd been marketed in Britain, although they'd existed in their native Germany since the sixties.
</li><li> The earliest mention of carbonara was during the immediate post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> period, when it became popular among American soldiers stationed in Italy. It is probably an amalgamation of earlier dishes using bacon or ham, cheese, pasta, and eggs.
</li><li> Although adding cherry-flavored syrup to Coca-Cola had been common in diners and soda fountains for decades before, Cherry Coke was only sold in stores starring in 1985.
</li><li> With as much of a holiday staple as it's become, it's easy to forget the pumpkin spice latte was only introduced by Starbucks in 2003.
</li><li> Tim Hortons, that quintessential Canadian icon for generations... except not. The chain's presence outside Ontario was almost non-existent until the 1990s (over 75% of its current nationwide locations were built after 1995), and it's only been the most popular fast-food chain in Canada since the early 2000s (replacing McDonald's, which has had a presence in Canada since 1967). The first Tim Hortons in BC opened in <strong>1994</strong>.
</li><li> Baby carrots were invented in 1986. They're not a separate cultivar, nor are they juvenile carrots, but rather just the cores cut out of carrots not suitable for store shelves.
</li><li> Oreo cookies weren't officially sold in the UK until 2008, where they are branded as Oreo <em>biscuits</em>. They were sold in China for longer than that, since 1996 to be exact.

Before then, hardtack was known as "bisket".
</li><li> The ubiquitous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_facts_label">nutrition facts label<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on American foodstuffs was introduced in 1994, before which nutritional information was sparsely displayed, if at all.

</li><li> Tarot cards for divination, that are distinct from playing cards, were not produced until the 18th century. Before then, Tarot cards were simply a style of playing cards and were not considered any better or worse for divination than any other style of playing card.
<ul><li> Not only that, the deck that many people think of as "classic" or "original" tarot cards is the Rider-Waite Deck, introduced specifically for divination in the 1910s. Much of modern Tarot's symbolism, and even some of the card identities, were invented for this deck.

It was originally part of a contemporary American trend of expanding decks beyond 52 cards with new ones, but the Joker was the only new card that caught on.
</li><li> The earliest form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">Poker</a> is first attested in 1829, in Mississippi.

It became a standard rule in American chess in the 1880s, and later still in the rest of the world.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History&nbsp;</div><div id="folder8" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Contrary to what <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenHur">Ben-Hur</a></em> would want you to believe, you could travel extensively through the ancient and medieval Mediterranean without finding a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveGalley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveGalley">Slave Galley</a>, but countless of well paid, well fed, and generally well treated professional rowers and sailors. It was in the 16th century when a naval arms race between the Ottoman Empire, the Knights Hospitaller, Spain, and later France made galleys switch nearly entirely to convicts, debtors, and slaves (always from another religion). In the Baltic, where galleys were used until the 19th century by Sweden and Russia, slaves were never employed.
</li><li> You probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">wouldn't expect</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishInquisition">the Spanish Inquisition</a> was only founded in 1478, one of the <em>last</em> European inquisitions to be created.
<ul><li> The Inquisition generally was actually closer to modern standards of jurisprudence than most civil courts of the time, having rules of evidence, an appeals process, and codified restrictions on the type and severity of punishments that could be imposed.
</li><li> The severity of the Spanish Inquisition was greatly exaggerated by Protestant propaganda&mdash;ironically, sometimes from the same countries who accused Spain of being "soft" with non-Christians just a century before (see below).
</li><li> Additionally, they did not consider witchcraft an "excepted crime"; ordinary standards of evidence were required. As a consequence, the only large witchcraze in Spain was the Basque witch hunt, and the friars who cooperated were punished for it by the Inquisition.
</li></ul></li><li> The expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 wasn't a revolutionary act either. Before that, the Jews had already been expelled four times from France (in 1254, 1322, 1359, and 1394), twice from Naples (1288 and 1293), and once from England (1290).
</li><li> Speaking of witches, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">European "witchcraze"</a> took place in the early-modern period, particularly during the Reformation, not (as it is so commonly assumed) during the Dark Ages (although there were occasional witch trials during that time).
<ul><li> Witchcraft was not considered a criminal offense in the state-wide law until the early 16th century and during actual Medieval times witch trials occurred rarely (witchcraft itself was not an offense but harm done by 'magical' means definitely was) and usually were nothing more than simple lynches.
</li><li> Part of that is the fact that too many people think the Dark Ages ended in roughly 1800. (Nowadays historians deny that there ever was a time such as the Dark Ages, but traditionally they ran from the fall of Rome in AD 476 to the crowning of Charlemagne in AD 800.)
</li><li> And the 'Dark Ages' themselves is a term linked closely to anglophone historiography. In many languages the corresponding term is 'the age of barbarian kingdoms' or 'the age of migrations'.
</li><li> In many places in the <em>actual</em> Dark Ages, believing in the power of witches was heresy in itself, i.e. a person who accused another of witchcraft (especially if there was no proof the other person believed him/herself to be a witch) would be the one in trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> The "traditional" notion of the role of women as solely mothers and wives didn't come to be until the Victorian era, and even then its implementation was largely a "luxury" available only to those who were reasonably well-off. While sexism certainly existed, the reality of life for the vast majority of people in pre-industrial agricultural society was hard work for both sexes. In Middle Age Europe, for example, wives helped craftsmen husbands and could continue running his business in widowhood. Agricultural work required both sexes to participate &mdash; at least, if you didn't want your family to starve to death. Dorothy Sayers <a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KmaOjZR4gcIC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=dorothy+sayers+are+women+human&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NDRxh6fz6P&amp;sig=GwxyNQcEQAzkDwWB__4sdcffWfU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c53LUb_IEeH50gGk5YGAAw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dorothy%20sayers%20are%20women%20human%20%22the%20whole%20of%20the%22&amp;f=false">pointed out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that pre-modern women effectively owned <em>entire industries</em> &mdash; many of which the Industrial Revolution had taken away.
</li><li> The concept of racial discrimination in the form we know it today is a product of the Age of Exploration. Before this, the main form of discrimination was based on class, language, and religion; the closest thing to racism back then would have been more like xenophobia (a general dislike of foreigners, without regard to the color of their skin). A black person in sixteenth-century England might well have encountered prejudice, but a white Spanish person would have suffered just as badly and probably worse. Ironically, it was only with the rise of greater equality and class mobility in the wake of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a>, the Protestant Reformation and the growth of modern science that racism raised its ugly head. It was primarily used to justify the Atlantic Slave Trade. Slavery was banned by the Church and seen as anti-Christian, so there needed to be a reason to enslave fellow human beings and other people. So people started to <em>discriminate</em> based on skin colour and ethnicity.
<ul><li> Even in the 19th-century United States, race was defined legalistically based on "blood quantums", or the proportion of recent ancestors who belonged to different races, rather than appearance or strict ancestry. The "one-drop rule" became the law only in the early 20th century, in Tennessee, rather than the Deep South. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassFail">Pass Fail</a> for more details.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown">"Hispanic"</a> race is both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>. Although Spanish-speaking peoples have thought of themselves as <em>una raza</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note121jq8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note121jq8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note121jq8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> which in Spanish means "ethnicity", not "race" </span> since at least the nineteenth century, it was not until the 1970s that <em>North</em> Americans began to officially recognize <em>mestizos</em> as a separate race. Prior to that, people of Spanish ancestry were assigned to whichever race to which their appearance most closely corresponded, with most of them being glossed as "white" (shades of <em>limpieza de sangre</em>).
</li><li> No sooner than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove">Courtly Love</a> had been invented than people began to lament its decay from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Good Old Ways</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>'s time.
</li><li> Despite the mythology and conspiracy theories that claim it to be nearly a thousand years old, if not more, Freemasonry as we know it only dates back to the early 1700s. The same is true of the Masonic Knights Templar, much as fringe historians like to treat them as if they were one and the same with <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsTemplar">Knights Templar</a>.
</li><li> Until the 19th century, prisons were seen as holding places for criminal suspects until the authorities could determine what else to do with them, whether that be a day in the stocks, whipping, fines, penal labor, execution, etc., or acquittal. Imprisonment as a punishment in and of itself didn't start, at all, until the late 18th century, out of Enlightenment-influenced opposition to state-sanctioned torture. Outside the Western world, imprisonment as punishment remained largely unknown until the mid-20th century.
</li><li> Newfoundland didn't join Canada until 1949 (though they'd been part of the initial talks about confederation in the 1860s and the issue kept being brought up periodically).
</li><li> The idea that regular, controlled inflation is a desirable and normal for an economy dates only back to the 1950s. Before then, the value of the US dollar was highly erratic, with as many years of deflation as inflation, and no guarantee of inflated value even over long periods of time. For example, the US dollar actually deflated (that is, <em>increased in value</em>) between 1800 and 1900, with an 1800 dollar being worth only 49 cents in 1900. It's only with the rise of monetarism in 20th-century economic theory that steady depreciation (i.e., inflation) of money value became a pursued policy of economic development. There's nothing natural about inflation; its regularity in the post-WW2 world has been effected through continuous government intervention. That said, the intervention is (1) sound&mdash;one thing that nearly all economists are agreed on is that avoiding deflation is very important (2) not entirely governmental (it's complicated, but even central banks can't create money; <em>private commercial banks</em> create money by making loans for reasons of basic economics that are fairly easy to understand but require too much verbiage to explain here) and (3) sort of inevitable (if you have pure fiat currency, another way doesn't make any sense).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland">Treasure Island</a></em> also popularized the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateBooty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateBooty">buried treasure</a>; only one real pirate, William ("Captain") Kidd, is recorded as actually doing so, and it's debatable whether or not he was actually a pirate at all. Captain Morgan (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">he was a real person</a>) was also said to have buried treasure and is generally accepted to be the trope originator, though this is also known to be patently false. Firstly, Morgan was a privateer rather than a pirate, and the treasure he supposedly "buried" wasn't looted as so much as it was embezzled from his employer, the British Crown.
</li><li> The famous "Keep Calm and Carry On" propaganda poster, though printed during World War II, was never actually used<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13bl9c');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13bl9c" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13bl9c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">because it was intended to be used if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot">Britain came under Nazi occupation</a></span> and was completely unknown until an old copy was rediscovered in a bookstore in 2000.
<ul><li> On a similar note, the American "We Can Do It!" poster (often called "Rosie the Riveter", though it had nothing to do with either the pop song or the Norman Rockwell painting of that name) was created as an in-house morale booster at Westinghouse plants during the war, and was only displayed for a couple of weeks in 1943. It didn't gain iconic status until its rediscovery in the 1980s.
</li></ul></li><li> Nationalism has only been a thing for a little over 200 years. Prior to events like the French Revolution, the concept of having a unified strength and loyalty towards your nation rather than your town or state would have been seen as rather silly. This is because back then, the idea of what constitutes a modern nation-state was a lot more nebulous than we would define it today, and most people weren't involved in politics. After all, it's hard for Germans or Italians in 1850 to have a pride in being "German" or "Italian" when neither of those things existed as unified states until 1871. Before that they were collections of small states, including numerous city-states, which was what people had loyalty to instead.
<ul><li> Tribalism, on the other hand, has been around as long as humanity. It's hard to be nationalistic when everyone lives in clustered town that are separated by each other by great distances and no ease of communication, but it's very easy to be fiercely loyal towards your known community and distrustful of the "other".
</li><li> The related concept of "one RULER per nation" is also quite new&mdash;for long stretches of time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> and anyone with sufficient power/money could call themselves a king (indeed, dukes and sovereign princes frequently descended from kings who were only slightly "demoted"). A given "country," depending on size, could have anywhere from a handful to DOZENS of petty-kingdoms who mostly just shared a language.
</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to colonialism and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orientalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orientalism">Orientalism</a> driven propaganda by the West, which resulted in people in the West as well as a lot of people in the colonized world, many people growing up think that Western civilization was always the most progressive, most wealthiest and freest civilization. Terms like Asiatic economy and Oriental despotism were used even by such anti-colonialist figures like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> to justify and explain western superiority and how people must compete with:
<ul><li> As historians have noted that for most of recorded human history: wealth flowed from the East to the West. Asia was far richer than Western Europe, and the West borrowed its ideas, values and knowledge from the East (Mathematics from the Egyptians, Religion from Judea, Numeral System from India and the Arab world and many others). Indeed that's why colonialism was ever a thing to start with. And it's only since the middle of the eighteenth century, that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower">Balance of Power</a> shifted from the East to the West.
</li><li> As for Oriental despotism and Asiatic decadence, some have noted that there were several incidents in Chinese history, where an Industrial Revolution could have taken place, and likewise the Industrial Revolution happening in England was itself based and helped by the destruction and impoverishment of high-quality high-demand Indian handicrafts and textiles. Likewise, several Indian rulers did make attempts to modernize and meet the British threat, such as Tipu Sultan, but the British stamped them out.
</li><li> Likewise, the Industrial Revolution happened in only part of Europe, in England and it was not inevitable that it would happen across the continent. Marx pointed out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Capitalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Capitalism">Capitalism</a> developed as a result of the revolutions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a>, but historians point out that the Industrial Revolution really took off in France during the reign of dictator Napoleon III who at that point had become an English client. The conditions for industrialization in other parts of Western Europe, leave alone Eastern Europe was quite delayed and indeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egypt</a> and British India had industrialized and modernized in the same time by then. Industrialization in North America did not lead, as the Founding Fathers assumed, to the inevitable end of slavery, and indeed Southern Slavery coexisted happily with capitalist and abolitionist England until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> made the English decide to cut its losses only to realize that India and Egypt are more profitable and superior markets and sources for raw cotton.
</li><li> The idea of diamonds from any other part of the world other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> is as new as the 1700s. For most of history, India had a monopoly on the global diamond trade, and the diamonds of every European royal crowns came from Indian mines and were traded and sold by Indian traders to the world. That changed when diamonds were discovered first in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Brazil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Brazil">Brazil</a>, and only in the middle of the 19th century were diamonds discovered in Africa (to which it remains most associated with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a> thanks to the De Beers Cartel and the "conflict diamond").
<ul><li> Even then, it took a long time to believe diamonds could be found in a cold country, that with India, Africa and South America being the only known sources. Then, small amounts were discovered in Arkansas; commercial mining was tried but failed, and the site is now open to public diamond digging (for a fee). Small amounts were later discovered in Russia's Ural Mountains - small enough for some to believe they were planted. It wasn't until the mid-20th century that large deposits were found in Siberia. Still later, large deposits were found in Western Australia and Canada's far north.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Because serfdom in Eastern Europe lasted until well into the third quarter of the 19th Century, and was abolished by Tsar Alexander II of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a> in the wake of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CrimeanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CrimeanWar">Crimean War</a>, long after Western European nations had modernized and advanced, many have seen Russia as a center of serfdom from time immemorial and key evidence of "Russian backwardness".
<ul><li> Since wealth flowed from "The east to the West", in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a>, Eastern Europe was wealthier than Western Europe (England, France, Germany). Furthermore serfdom at that time existed in Western Europe while in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus">Kievan Rus'</a> you had free movement of peasants and other forms of rights and privileges.
</li><li> Certain nationalist Russians blame the Mongol Invasion for the arrival of "oriental backwardness" and the introduction of serfdom and the real reason why they missed out on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a> (as seen in the subtext of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardToBeAGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardToBeAGod">Hard to Be a God</a> and <em>Andrei Rublev</em>). In actual fact, serfdom in Eastern Europe was introduced by the highly sophisticated and advanced, and totally Catholic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth">Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in the 1400s. The latter had vast farmland and was a bread basket region and to maximize exports, they passed laws tying peasants to the lands and those lands were organized into <em>folwarks</em> (plantations) run by Poland's warrior-caste nobility.
</li><li> The reasons for this "Second Serfdom" (as historians have called it) is precisely because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a> in the West. Serfdom ended with the Black Death, and the rise of towns and cities and diverse merchant trade, and part of the reason was that agricultural demand increased in Poland who exported huge amounts of food to the West and grew wealthy. Many historians claim that Western Europeans grew wealthy on the impoverishment of Eastern Europe.
</li><li> Serfdom arrived in Russia after Ivan the Terrible's conquest and unification. He was the first to pass laws restricting movement and rights of peasants. It continued under Boris Godunov and the later Romanovs that followed. The reason for this, was that the Russians wanted to imitate the Polish and cater to export demands by Western Europe. And as Poland and Russia expanded in territory, so did serfdom across Eastern Europe. It was not an inevitable or eternal problem of "eastern" backwardness at all.

The yen was created in 1871 as the direct analogue of the dollar, and was itself subdivided into 100 <em>sen</em>, analogues to the cent. <em>Sen</em> were removed from circulation in 1953.

</li><li> The loonie, the Canadian one-dollar coin, was introduced in 1987, and the toonie (the two-dollar coin) in 1996. Before then, Canada used one-dollar and two-dollar bills, like the US.
</li><li> The Canadian GST (Goods and Services Tax), Canada's federal point-of-sale tax that adds 5% additional cost to most consumer goods, was introduced in 1991 by the Brian Mulroney government. Before then, sales taxes were paid on the manufacturer's side, not the consumer's.

</li><li> Currently, the monarch of Ancient Egypt is only known to have been called "pharaoh" (which literally means "great house," i.e. court or palace) from the middle of the New Kingdom onward. This period excludes everything from the country's unification to the building of the great pyramids, the Hyksos' invasion, and even some of the famous earlier New Kingdom monarchs like Hatshepsut and Tutankhamun. Granted, the usage is still older than most countries that still exist today - but looking at it another way, Egypt was already an ancient country when it started.
</li><li> The Christianization of Lithuania didn't begin until 1387, and paganism remained dominant among Lithuanian commoners until the 17th century. It was the last region of Europe to be Christianized.
</li><li> Some of the larger Native American tribes including the Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche, and Seminole, moved into the areas we think 'ancestral' to them only in the 18th or late 17th century at most. They were often helped because said areas had been depopulated of other tribes by European epidemics.

</li><li> Hawaii was first inhabited circa AD 900, and Easter Island sometime between AD 1000 and 1200. The Easter Island <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EenieMeenieMinyMoai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EenieMeenieMinyMoai">moai</a></em> are often assumed to be incredibly ancient (the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon">Godzilla vs. Megalon</a></em> makes them <strong>three million</strong> years old) but were actually built between AD 1250 and 1500.
</li><li> Trigger discipline&mdash;that is, the gun-safety principle of always keeping one's finger off the trigger unless firing&mdash;did not become a standard part of firearms training until the 1980s, before which gun users did, indeed, tend to keep their fingers on the trigger. This makes depictions of trigger discipline in historical settings, e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em>, anachronistic.

<ul><li> Many Americans (conservatives and old-school liberals, mostly) will insist that the United States has always been a country committed to free enterprise and that restraints on trade are unconstitutional, if not socialistic. Funny, that didn't stop the U.S. from being one of the most rabidly protectionist economies on the face of the earth until well into the twentieth century. It was not until 1944, at the Bretton Woods economic summit in New Hampshire, that the U.S. (along with most other countries) finally committed itself to the principle of free trade. Prior to that, high tariffs were as American as apple pie, while free trade was something the hated British practiced. (Oh, and conservatives originally <em>opposed</em> free trade, as do some paleoconservatives even today.)
</li><li> Compulsory wearing of seat belts in cars? 1970 in Victoria, Australia. 1972 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a>. <em>1983</em> in the UK, and another year before the first of the United States (New York) took it up. It's still not illegal in New Hampshire ("<em>Live Free or Die</em>, motherfuckers!").
<ul><li> The compulsory wearing of seat belts initially applied to the driver and front seat passenger only in many countries. Compulsory wearing for all passengers was introduced in 1989 in New Zealand and 1991 in the UK.
</li><li> In Italy, they are compulsory only since 1st Jan 1993.
</li><li> Philippines is very bad with seat belts, not passing a law mandating the use of seatbelts until 1999, and to this day, most people there still don't care for them. And this is in a country whose traffic is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> in automotive form compared to what you'd expect in America.
</li></ul></li><li> Switzerland gave women the vote in federal elections... in 1973!

<ul><li> The Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden didn't allow women to vote in local elections until 1991.
</li><li> Kuwait extended suffrage to women in 2005.
</li><li> Despite being a fairly early adopter of women's suffrage (Quebec excluded), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canada</a> shamefully withheld the vote from large numbers of its aboriginal population until the mid '60s.
</li></ul></li><li> In American politics, the consistent use of red to represent the Republican Party and blue for the Democratic Party (and the corresponding terms "Red State" and "Blue State") only goes back to the 2000 election. While the use of different colors for the two sides in an electoral contest dates back to at least the time of color television, previously the major networks and newspapers had alternated colors for the parties in each election cycle and different networks and publications would each use their own colors. However, in 2000 red for Republicans and blue for Democrats happened to be common, and the protracted count, recount, and court battle cemented the associations in the public consciousness. This is particularly inexcusable in 2016 because this happened within the lifetimes of everyone old enough to vote.
<ul><li> Specifically, blue was used for the incumbent party and red for the challenging party.
</li><li> As many people have pointed out, this is something of a historical reversal given the association of red with the political left and blue with the political right. American sources and web sites that predate the 2000 election (such as the US Election Atlas) and that didn't apply the blue/incumbent and red/challenger method that the TV networks used tend to use the more traditional red/liberal and blue/conservative color scheme on their own maps.
</li><li> Political commentators these days exploit different connotations that suit the new colour scheme: red with "redneck" and "red-blooded male" stereotypes of conservatives and their supporters; "blue", on the other hand, can comfortably stand in for the "blue humor" favored by supposedly licentious liberals.
<ul><li> It should be noted, though, that the term "redneck" was originally a term for a political faction within the Democratic Party, though it did refer to the sort of people it refers to today (poor white Southerners, particularly farmers).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The two-day weekend was invented in the eastern United States in the 1930s, as a way to let both Christian and Jewish workers observe the Sabbath. Previously, virtually all people worked 6 days a week. Likewise, the 40-hour work week didn't become widespread until the 1950s in the US, and not until later in many other countries.
</li><li> Although freeways date back to the 1920s, the Interstate Highway System (which set up the route numbering system designated by red, white, and blue shields) was not enacted until 1956.
<ul><li> Freeways themselves were often used just for things like shipping war supplies until the 1940s.
</li></ul></li><li> There was no "Divine Right of Kings" in the Middle Ages; the idea developed in the 17th century in reaction to the growing influence of presbyterian Protestantism, around the same time that absolute monarchy began to emerge as a political system in France and, to a lesser extent, England. It was developed as an ideology that would unify political <em>and</em> religious authority in the king, as opposed to medieval monarchy, which left religious matters to an independent church. Therefore, any projection of the "divine right" into premodern Europe, as if that is how monarchy was always viewed by all people before modern democracy, is a slight exaggeration driven by the fact that the two greatest anti-monarchical revolutions in France and Russia, <em>did</em> revolt against the Divine Right.
</li><li> The idea of banning drugs is actually a pretty modern one. Even in places where drug use was religiously prohibited (e.g. in the Muslim world vis-a-vis alcohol), nobody ever thought that the government should go after people who used intoxicants. Modern drug laws developed slowly in the 19th and 20th centuries, often for really vile reasons that had nothing to do with public health; you can see this particularly strongly in the US, where states on or near the Mexican border tended to ban cannabis use (because of the perception that only "dirty" Mexicans used it), while California (which had a long-running vendetta against its Chinese residents) banned opium (perceived to be a Chinese thing).
<ul><li> A particularly interesting one: the first time that LSD was banned was by California in 1966; it was later banned at the federal level in 1970. This was itself the result of long-term wrangling about the meaning and application of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs; when the treaty was first being negotiated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, the United States was one of the countries vehemently insisting that manufactured drugs like LSD should <em>not</em> be banned.
</li><li> As recently as 1860, Britain and France were fighting wars with China in order to force them to <em>legalise</em> the opium trade.
</li></ul></li><li> The PRC adopted the One-child Policy in 1979. For most of Mao Zedong's reign (1949-1976), Chinese were encouraged to have as many children as possible.
</li><li> Sodomy laws were still formally on the books in 14 US states until the Supreme Court struck them down in <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> in 2003. That said, they were virtually never enforced; the only reason that <em>Lawrence</em> reached the Supreme Court at all was (1) the particular cop who arrested the defendants in <em>Lawrence</em> had a personal grudge against one of them, and charged them with sodomy basically because he had nothing else to go on, and (2) the defendants were persuaded not to defend the charge on the merits or attempt to suppress the cops' evidence, the idea being that this was a one-in-a-million opportunity for gay-rights organizations to get sodomy laws struck down once and for all. Even then, when the case came up to the federal Supreme Court, only a bare 5-justice majority actually bought the idea that the law was unconstitutional because it dealt with what people could do in their own bedrooms&mdash;Justice O'Connor said that the law would've been fine if it had been forbidden anal and oral sex to everyone, rather than just to same-sex couples, while the other three justices were fine with the law's constitutionality (although Justice Thomas famously took time out of his day to write a short dissent calling the Texas sodomy statute "uncommonly silly").
</li><li> As late as the early 1990s, most Americans opposed interracial marriage, with opinion polls first showing a majority in favor in 1994. Sizable minorities of Americans over the age of 50 <em>still</em> oppose it, as do smaller minorities of younger people.
</li><li> The star-and-crescent didn't start becoming a pan-Islamic symbol until the 1950s; before then, it was an emblem of the Ottoman Empire specifically, and later of Turkish nationalism, and generally not associated with Islam specifically. The reason why the Turkish symbol is viewed as inseparable from Islam is because they were the longest-serving guardians of the two holiest sites of Mecca and Medina and the Turkish sultan also served as as caliph, the successor of Muhammed and spiritual leader of all Muslims worldwide, though it should be noted that they didn't start out this way - the sultan was an originally secular title that became religious after Selim the Grim took the two sites from the Abbasids.

</li><li> In America, it wasn't legalized until the then-Governor of California, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, signed it into state law in 1969. It was then legalized in 49 of the 50 states by 1985, with New York being the last to legalize it in <em>2010</em>. Before then, couples wishing to split had to prove a reason for the divorce. Usually the wife would claim "cruelty" and greatly exaggerate abusive scenarios before a judge (saying her husband hit her, swore at her, etc), or the wife would claim adultery by allowing/encouraging her husband to date other women, frequently to the point where a couple which mutually desired divorce would hire a private detective and arrange with them to have the husband "caught" in a place where it would be conveniently easy to take a few photos to document the event. In a few places where abandonment/desertion was a possible grounds for divorce and the parties weren't especially urgent to get the papers through, one of the partners might agree to quietly set everything up for a move and then make a show of cursing the other spouse out over something ludicrously petty, storming out of the house, moving to the new place, and carefully avoiding going anywhere near the marital home for the next year or two. Usually there was lots of perjury involved (an old legal story is about a judge who would always say, at the beginning of his days earmarked for divorce proceedings, "Let the perjury commence"), and this was a key reason for no-fault divorces finally being legalized.
</li></ul></li><li> For most of history, "democracy" has been a <em>pejorative</em> term; in ancient Greece, Rome, all of medieval Europe, and the early United States, "democracy" was synonymous with mob rule, the boorish masses attempting to force their way on the civilized elite. The Founding Fathers of the US often went out of their way to specify they were <em>not</em> creating a democracy; the word did not start to gain positive connotations in the US until the Jacksonian populist movement of the 1820s, and later still in Europe. Furthermore, the states of the classical world and the late 18th/early 19th centuries now retrospectively (and anachronistically) referred to as "democracies" were, at best, oligarchies with limited suffrage. First only people who had the right by birth could vote (the citizens of Ancient Greek poleis and Rome - very exclusive groups, all of them), later, wealthy people could vote, (the szlachta of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth">Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>), then this devolved to people who owned property and had tax records, in both England and the United States. Naturally women, non-Christians<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note162mzm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note162mzm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note162mzm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the case of England, non-Protestants</span>, and minorities need not apply. This meant that for most of history in the Western World, the vast majority of people did not have any voice and representation in political office. Voting was seen as a privilege and <em>not</em> a right.
<ul><li> It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> which first advanced universal <em>male</em> suffrage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17cs7b');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17cs7b" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17cs7b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That is all men, regardless of wealth and property, regardless of race and religion: which meant French blacks, French Jews, French Protestants, which they put into effect in 1792 (and enshrined by law in the 1793 Constitution, which was never implemented on account of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Reign of Terror</a>)</span> after the Storming of the Tuileries, when France was in the middle of Civil War and instability, which meant that only a small part of the population voted anyway (mostly the Paris Basin area). The Second French Revolution of 1848, which brought back universal <em>male</em> suffrage after the Directory and Napoleonic reversal, had greater voter turnout but since the Forty-Eighters had no support base across France<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1813v8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1813v8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1813v8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They were a mix of Centrists, Nostalgic Neo-Jacobins and Socialists, and the centrists (such as Alexis de Tocqueville) wanted nothing to do with the others and backed efforts to suppress the other parties, which prevented any broad republican consensus on the Left</span> and lacked a proper candidate, the man who got voted in was Napoleon III, cue comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a>: "First time as tragedy, second time as farce."
</li><li> Universal <em>male</em> suffrage was actually a hot button issue in the US and much of Europe during most of the 19th century. And that's <em>before</em> you take into account "rotten boroughs"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19i5ld');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19i5ld" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19i5ld');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A borough is the British term for a Parliamentary district that sent two members to the House of Commons. Rotten, or pocket, boroughs were districts that had been enfranchised by the King (some as far back as Norman times) but had lost their population or importance due to migration and regular demographic change (in one case, half the town had fallen into the sea). Thus a very small electorate, easily open to bribes and influence, could send two members to Parliament. One of the most notorious was Old Sarum, which had 20 eligible voters and was controlled by a landowner, while large cities like Manchester were effectively unrepresented. The Reform Act of 1832 effectively abolished this system, and only because the King flooded the House of Lords with enough new peerages to pass the Act. </span>, and gerrymandered districts that basically cheated those few working class people who could vote out of any meaningful say and gave the power to the landed gentry. In fact, one party that campaigned against the ridiculous property-based voting law in Prussia still exists: the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of today's Germany. In England, incremental changes led to the Chartist Movement and the 1867 Reform Act, before a final Reform act after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> decisively expanded the franchise. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> allowed male suffrage and limited welfare (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMoralSubstitute">with the aim of bribing people away from radicalism</a>) in a Reichstag which nonetheless gave the Kaiser most of the power.
</li><li> <em>Female</em> suffrage will see its centenary in the 21st century in most of the world. Some Scandinavian, Eastern European and Commonwealth countries gave women the vote before England and the United States (at the federal level) did in 1920. As for France, well women didn't get the vote until <em>1945, the Liberation of France</em>, which means that women's suffrage in France has a slightly longer history than India (which gave universal suffrage, male and female, upon independence).
<ul><li> Peculiarly, women having the right to vote is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>. In the Holy Roman Empire, high-ranking Abbesses in the Catholic Church were allowed to vote in assemblies alongside the various princes, and there are plenty of instances of conditional women's suffrage throughout the 1700s and 1800s. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a> notoriously allowed women property owners the right to vote <em>by accident</em> in the late 18th century, though this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">reversed as soon as a woman actually tried to exercise her voting rights</a>.) As for universal suffrage, the Corsican Republic allowed women to vote in 1755, though it was revoked when it was annexed by France in 1768, and the Pitcairn Islands granted it in 1838. And France wasn't the last Western European country to give women the vote, as Switzerland and Lichtenstein only allowed it in 1971 (at the federal level) and 1984, respectively, meaning that North Korea gave women the right to vote earlier than they did (1946, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">yes, they do actually hold elections</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> The problem of course comes from the shifting definition of Democracy and Republic. While everyone agrees that democracy and representative government existed in some form in Athens, Rome and other city-states, the modern form of republic was <em>anathema</em> to the classic world (which brutally crushed any attempts to expand suffrage). England and the United States still took Rome as a model, which meant that they understood "liberty" as perfectly consistent with slavery and exclusion of women, after all <em>the Romans did it</em>, and they expanded suffrage only in the wake of global movements and intellectual challenges (which did not exist for Greece and Rome). Democracy was equated with "mob rule" and was seen as impractical, while Republic government was essentially an oligarchical plutocracy. The historian R. R. Palmer credits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/MaximilienRobespierre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/MaximilienRobespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> with defining modern democracy: <em>Only a democratic or republican government&mdash; these two words are synonyms despite the abuses in common speech&mdash;because an aristocracy is no closer than a monarchy to being a republic. Democracy is a state in which the sovereign people, guided by laws which are of their own making, do for themselves all that they can do well, and by their delegates do all that they cannot do for themselves</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Legal slavery, as in there is a law on the books that says people can be slaves, was banned at different times in different places. You might have heard that Lincoln freed the slaves (he did, just not in 1863, rather in 1865 &mdash; at least if we are talking about Maryland, Kentucky, West Virginia and Delaware), but of course the United States were neither the first country to ban slavery nor the last. Both Britain and France actually banned slavery before the US. The French did it twice (1793, 1848, both times by Republican governments), but only France and the United States abolished without compensating slaveowners (which the English did, naturally<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20b6s4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note20b6s4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20b6s4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The famous "liberal" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamGladstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamGladstone">William Gladstone</a> was the son of a slaveowner who owned <em>2039 slaves in the Caribbean</em> and successfully lobbied for compensation for himself and other slaveowners on the 1833 emancipation</span>). Brazil did not ban slavery until 1888 and some Arab countries still had slavery in the second half of the 20th century. And this of course does not even take into account the not exactly "laws on the books" forms of slavery in existence today. Some estimates say there have never been more slaves in the world than today.
<ul><li> That is, Britain and France abolished it nationally before the United States did. Vermont abolished slavery in its Constitution, so 1777 (if you go by when they wrote it) or 1791 (when they managed to get the federal government to accept them and their Constitution as the first non-original state and first free state).
</li></ul></li><li> The "working-class right-wing bigot" has probably existed for as long as the liberal/conservative divide itself. However, it didn't start to become a political phenomenon until the 1950s, and didn't become a <em>cultural</em> phenomenon until about the early '70s, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">Archie Bunker</a> character popularized it.
</li><li> The ubiquitous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IApprovedThisMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IApprovedThisMessage">I Approved This Message</a> disclaimer at the end of U.S. political ads was mandated by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. When first used in the 2004 election, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> actually put the disclaimer at the beginning of his ads while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnKerry">John Kerry</a> put it at the end. Kerry might have lost the election, but putting the disclaimer at the end has since become the standard.
</li><li> The conservative hatred for socialized medicine in the US. While there were instances such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, in his early political career, going as far as recording <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Speaks_Out_Against_Socialized_Medicine">a LP of spoken word<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> against it, in 1971, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> (yes, "Tricky Dick") proposed a health care reform plan that was way more liberal than Obama's Affordable Care Act ended up being. It didn't pass because <em>Democrats</em> were against it &mdash; Ted Kennedy wanted a single-payer system.
</li><li> When Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, the Republican party was ambivalent towards the legalization of abortion. Nixon and Ford both supported it and the decision came from a conservative majority Supreme Court. Hell, Reagan liberalized abortion laws when he was governor of California in the '60s. It's not until the GOP got slaughtered in the 1974 midterms that the party decided to use it to go after evangelical voters.
</li><li> In the US, nudity was required for boys and men at most single-sex swimming pools until the 1960s. The rationale was founded in the American Public Health Association's recommendation. Until the introduction of nylon bathing suits, most &mdash; for men and women &mdash; were made of <em>wool</em>. Pool filters were easily clogged by shed wool fibers. Nylon swim trunks, improvements in pool filters and heavier use of stronger chlorine allowed the APHA to drop the recommendation in 1962, but some didn't stop the practice until the 1980s. As gender-integrated swimming pools became the norm, male nudity was phased out.
<ul><li> It wasn't until the late 1940s that men were widely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NippleAndDimed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NippleAndDimed">allowed to go topless</a> at pools and beaches.
</li></ul></li><li> At-will employment&mdash;i.e, the right of an employer to fire a worker for any reason at any time&mdash;does not predate the late nineteenth century, with the principle first formulated in Horace Gray Wood's 1877 treatise <em>Master and Servant</em>. American courts generally ruled in at-will employment as law during the 1880s and 1890s, reversing centuries of precedent from English common law that that employees were assumed to be hired under a minimum one-year contract unless the worker agreed otherwise at the time of hiring. During the early and mid-nineteenth century, American courts had gradually whittled this convention down, ruling that a worker must be given at least one pay period's worth of notice (i.e, one week, one month, or one year) before dismissal, before ultimately stripping workers of any rights in the matter at the century's end.
</li><li> Spousal rape (i.e., the right of a man to rape his wife) was legal virtually everywhere until the 1970s, with the Soviet Union (1922) being one of the very few exceptions. For instance, all 50 US states permitted it until the 1970s, when state courts gradually started ruling against it. Oklahoma and North Carolina didn't outlaw it until 1993. Below are the years in which several other countries prohibited the practice:
<ul><li> Canada in 1983.
</li><li> Ireland in 1990.
</li><li> England in 1991.
</li><li> France in 1992.
</li><li> Finland in 1994.
</li><li> Germany in 1997.
</li><li> Thailand in 2007.
</li><li> And it's still legal in dozens of other countries, including India and China.
<ul><li> Note that while merely being <em>technically</em> legal, an act of spousal rape could <em>still</em> be prosecuted as battery combined with sexual violence, especially if the victim had been wounded in the act. In most cases the spousal rape had not been outlawed in fear of false prosecutions.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Face-to-face debating as a routine part of American politics is an invention of the television age. The first time presidential candidates debated each other was when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> did so in 1960, but the practice didn't immediately catch on, and a second set of presidential debates didn't happen until 1976, and in 1980 a single debate barely happened. It wasn't the 1984 election that presidential debates became a standard part of the process. 1984 was also the first time a debate between vice presidential candidates took place. Even for lower offices, there had been only a scant few debates before 1960, most notably the Lincoln/Douglas Senate debates in 1858.
<ul><li> In the 19th century, presidential candidates did not openly seek the presidency at all. The ideal in American politics was for politicians to <em>not</em> seek office, but to be humble and virtuous pillars of their community, who only reluctantly accepted the nominations of their peers. Thus, to keep up this appearance, candidates made no public appearances during election season, gave no speeches, etc. The first major-party candidate to openly campaign on their own behalf was William Jennings Bryan in 1896.
</li></ul></li><li> The interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment is a controversial issue, but it wasn't until <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> in 2008 that the Supreme Court extended it to mean that individuals in the United States have a right to own a personal firearm for self-defense (as opposed to a right to own a firearm for militia service). Since D.C. is not a state itself, it wasn't determined until two years later that this right had to be applied to the individual states as part of the due process clause.
</li><li> Homebrew beer was illegal in the United States until 1978.
</li><li> The idea of having border fortifications between the US and Mexico is a product of the Great Depression. Prior to then, Mexican migrant workers were welcome to come and go as they pleased across the border as the seasons changed. Even then, most of the border apparatus we know today didn&#146;t really come to fruition until the Bush Jr. administration, though Clinton started the process.
</li><li> The city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London">London</a> didn't have a democratically elected mayor until 2000. In fact, <em>no</em> cities or towns in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom">United Kingdom</a> had democratically elected mayors before that point; before a local London referendum in 1998, and a later act of Parliament in 2000, cities and towns in the UK were generally run either by city councils or Lord Mayors.
</li><li> Heavily partisan politics in America have only been the norm since around the 1980s. Prior to then, both major political parties had liberal and conservative wings, and it wasn't uncommon for Americans to vote for different parties from one election to the next. As recently as the 1976 presidential election, many people believed that Democrat Jimmy Carter was actually more conservative than his Republican opponent, Gerald Ford. This can mostly be chalked up to the heavily Democratic generation that grew up during the FDR administration (since one of the biggest indicators of your <a class="urllink" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/partisan-loyalty-begins-at-age-18/">your partisan lean<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.people-press.org/2015/04/30/a-different-look-at-generations-and-partisanship/">comes from how successful the president of your early adulthood is<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), beginning to die off and being replaced in the electorate by their more conservative kids. Since Democrats controlled pretty much everything from the FDR administration until the Carter administration (Eisenhower and Nixon were both incredibly moderate, at least on economics), Republicans had no other choice but to have separate factions and to play ball with Democrats. When Republicans controlled everything from the Civil War to the FDR administration, large swathes of the population were still disenfranchised and Republicans could do whatever the hell they want. The '80s was the first time the parties had very different electoral makeups because it was the first time anything was competitive when women and ethnic minorities could vote. Now that the parties' voters are so different <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21qcjw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21qcjw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21qcjw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Republicans are increasingly white, married, non-college educated Christians who live in rural/exurban places while Democrats are people of color, religious minorities, city dwellers, college educated white people, and unmarried women</span>, they don't need to have different wings.
</li><li> Seniors being a reliable Republican voting block is a recent phenomenon. As recently as the 2000 presidential election, Democrats&#146; best age group was those over the age of 65. This is due to the generational turnover as explained above.
</li><li> The modern American political parties&#146; development can be traced back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> administration but didn&#146;t really start taking shape until the FDR administration. For the second half of the 19th Century and well into the 20th, there wasn&#146;t much difference between the parties other than support for tariffs (Republicans for, Democrats not so much). There were only two Democratic presidents between the Civil War and World War I since so many people supported Republican trade policies. By the time of the Depression, people voted for Roosevelt to just try something different since tariffs had so exacerbated the suffering. Roosevelt really only started experimenting with what&#146;d become of the modern party&#146;s economic principles (like adopting Keynesian economics) out of desperation more than anything. He was willing to throw everything against the wall in the hope that something would stick.
</li><li> African Americans being almost monolithically (about 90%) Democrats only really dates back to the Civil Rights legislation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> administration. When black men were granted the right to vote in the 1870s, they were almost exclusively Republicans because they were so oppressed by the solidly Democratic governors in the south and to support the party of Lincoln. Republican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was the first president to have an official meeting with a black person and he made a point to start appointing more black people to federal positions. Things began to start to shift as more time passed from slavery and as they started leaving the south en masse and moving to the cities of the north in the early 20th century. It picked up throughout the New Deal Era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDelanoRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDelanoRoosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>. With urban Democrats supporting Unions in the North, there was an upward mobility for emigrants not seen back home. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightEisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> was the last Republican (who was incredibly moderate and really more of an Independent) to really try to reach out to black voters and court their support but by that point the damage had started to really take effect. The shift really took hold as the Democrats took the mantle of the party of Civil Rights in the '60s. No Republican presidential nominee has gotten more than 13% of the black vote since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> in 1968.
</li><li> The US government's Department of Homeland Security and its related agencies (such as ICE) didn't exist until 2002; they were created in response to 9/11.
</li><li> The term <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">"Overton window"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &mdash; meaning the range of opinions considered politically acceptable in mainstream discourse &mdash; is named after Joseph P. Overton, who, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mackinac.org/12481">according<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to his colleague Joseph G. Lehman, first described it in the mid-1990s. However, the idea was never published or made known to the wider world until after Overton's death in 2003, at which point Lehman began to publicize it; the first appearances of the term "Overton window" in the press date to 2006.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianPolitics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianPolitics">Conservative Party of Canada</a>&mdash;currently one of the two most powerful political parties in the country&mdash;has only existed since 2003, when it was formed from a union of several smaller conservative and right-wing parties. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianPrimeMinisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianPrimeMinisters">Stephen Harper</a> (Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015) was actually the first member of the party to serve as Prime Minister, and previously helped found the party. For perspective: the Liberal Party of Canada (their primary rival) has been around since 1867.
<ul><li> However, this is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, as the name "Conservative Party of Canada" was one of the many names used from 1867 onward by one of the major parties of Canadian politics, and is the name most commonly used to refer to them historically. This Conservative Party of Canada merged with the Progressive Party of Canada in 1942, becoming the Progressive-Conservative party, which was one of the major parties involved in the 2003 union.
</li></ul></li><li> In the United States, credit cards were not issued to women in their own name until the passing of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974. Most banks did not give loans to women until then, either.
</li><li> The first election in Great Britain to take place on a single day was in 1918; before then, elections took place over a four-week period.
<ul><li> Similarly, American presidential elections took place over the 34 days preceding the first Wednesday in December, until 1845, when a federal law established a uniform, single election day in November. This change was due to the invention of the telegraph and its potential to influence results during the course of an election in areas that had not voted yet.
</li></ul></li><li> American elections did not use secret ballots until after the 1884 presidential election (between then and 1891, all states made the switch). Before then, votes were publicly declared at the voting booth, and voters presented pre-printed ballots that were distributed in partisan newspapers. The UK switched to secret ballots only slightly earlier, in 1872.
</li><li> There were no primaries in American presidential elections until 1912, and even as late as 1968, only 12 states used them. Furthermore, primaries were not binding until the 1972 election season, following party reforms by both the Democrats and the Republicans. Before then, presidential candidates were chosen at the national party conventions, which were real contests (albeit rife with back-room deals), unlike the formalities they have become today.
</li><li> The notion of journalistic objectivity&mdash;i.e., that reporters should be "fair" and present all sides of an issue as equally valid, and not express their opinion&mdash;first emerged in the 1920s United States, being particularly influenced by the work of Walter Lippman. Before then, newspapers were openly and proudly partisan, and were expected to be.
</li><li> Flogging as a criminal punishment wasn't outlawed in the UK until 1961.

</li><li> The prose poem "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Desiderata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Desiderata">Desiderata</a>" has been widely attributed to being <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fleurdelis.com/desidera.htm">found in an old church and dated 1692<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but was actually written by Max Ehrmann in 1927. The 20th-century English it's written in kind of gives it away.
</li><li> Lower-case letters were first developed in the 8th century, as a kind of shorthand used by bureaucrats who worked for Charlemagne. Documents and literary works older than this were written IN ALLCAPS ONLY.
<ul><li> There was a form of shorthand for the latin alphabet prior to this, but it had largely been forgotten by the time modern minuscules were created. It can still be seen on some inscriptions.
</li><li> Lower-case and upper-case letters weren't mixed until the 14th century. Before then, documents would only use one or the other (formal documents and books were upper-case, while informal bureaucratic notes were lower-case.)
</li><li> Until the early 19th century, nouns were usually capitalized in English writing; this practice survives in German to this day.
</li></ul></li><li> The concept of standardized spelling is also a relatively recent phenomenon, generally traced back to when dictionaries were first compiled. Mainly Samuel Johnson's first dictionary in 1755. Medieval scribes spelled words however they wanted, and didn't care about consistency, often spelling a word multiple ways even within a single page of text.
</li><li> Until approximately 1800, the letter 's' had two forms, the more common being the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s">long s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which looks almost identical to an 'f'.
</li><li> Most depictions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em> have little to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryShelley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryShelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s original work. In the original book there is no Igor, castle, or angry peasants storming the place. In fact Victor Frankenstein realizes right after making his monster what a horrible mistake he made (in fact, that's rather the problem). The monster himself, in contrast to most depictions, is quite articulate and of remarkable agility. The story most people think of originates from the 1931 film of the same name. Igor was popularized by 1970s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein">Young Frankenstein</a></em> which parodied a tradition that coalesced from various mad scientists' henchmen over the years, some being named variously Igor or Ygor, since <em>Son of Frankenstein</em> in 1939. (The 1931 film didn't have an Igor though it contained a similar character named Fritz.)
<ul><li> And various movies notwithstanding, Victor Frankenstein was neither a doctor nor a baron, and he was not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein">from Transylvania</a>; he was a Swiss student from Geneva at Ingolstadt University.
</li><li> Likewise, the monster was <em>never</em> referred to as Frankenstein in the novel, even though people have started doing so in recent years. Frankenstein was his <em>creator</em>. Also, in the book, the monster isn't a mindless killing machine. He displays many human traits, and can even be viewed as sympathetic in some parts, although he certainly does some pretty terrible things as the plot progresses.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22uoer');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22uoer" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22uoer');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The real monster is, arguably, "good" Victor's horrible parenting skills, as they are what drive the creature to desperation and murder.</span>
<ul><li> This may be a case of the viewers being better than expected at catching the themes rather than worse. The implication of the book is that the creature is effectively Victor Frankenstein's son. Traditionally in Europe, a son carries the surname of the father. Ergo the monster's name is, in fact, Frankenstein... no matter how much time Victor spends throughout the book denying it.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, when people think of the creation of the Monster, they envision it being brought to life by a bolt of lightning, which is what happened in the 1931 film. In the novel, the reader never learns how Frankenstein was able to bring his creature to life because he explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndSomeOtherStuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndSomeOtherStuff">left the details out so that nobody could ever repeat his mistake</a>.
<ul><li> Though it may have been how Victor made the creature in the novel, as he marvels at the power of a lightning bolt striking an oak tree shortly before leaving for Ingolstadt, the place of creation.
</li></ul></li><li> The Monster was not made from corpses. Victor Frankenstein studied dead bodies and decay to learn the secrets of life, but the creature itself was made from scratch.
</li><li> The book also alludes to several historcial alchemist which kind of implies that Victor used a method similar to that of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHomunculiAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHomunculiAreDifferent">Homunculi</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Orcs, "halflings" and tall, beautiful elves are such a staple in fantasy nowadays that when one reads <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> it's tempting to react with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsBeenDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsBeenDone">It's Been Done</a>. However, Tolkien invented much of those concepts, with the exception of his elvish depiction. This originated in ancient Icelandic and Germanic beliefs about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> &mdash; he talks about the history, in terms of beliefs about elves or fairies being little creatures, in his essay "<a class="urllink" href="http://brainstorm-services.com/wcu-2004/fairystories-tolkien.pdf">On Fairy-Stories<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>". Lord Dunsany's <em>The King of Elfland's Daughter</em> was the first work of literature to depart from the concept of elves as "little people". Despite that, most of the modern depictions of elves take their inspiration from Tolkien's elves, and in more than just appearance.
<ul><li> Ents, too. Many people are unaware that ents were not actually a part of traditional mythology.
</li></ul></li><li> Ivan Barkov is best known for his obscene poem "Luka Mudischev", with all the other works being secondary, and non obscene works being all but forgotten. Except that even the most basic analysis of "Luka" shows it was written about a century after Barkov, and other works attributed date from as late as the 20th century.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novel">Novels</a> as we know them are only 200-300 years old (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>, the first modern novel, was published in 1605-1615). Older long-form fiction was mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">Based on a Great Big Lie</a> or an epic poem.
<ul><li> Though you could argue that Chretien de Troyes wrote quite an epic... novel in the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XIIth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XIIth">XI Ith</a> century, which was adaptated a few years later by Robert de Boron under the name Le roman du Graal - literally "The novel of the Graal". And in the XIVth, Helie de Boron even avoided verses.
</li></ul></li><li> In the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em>, Harold Hill refers to "Captain Billy's Whiz Bang", which was a joke magazine that didn't exist until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. However, the show is set in 1912. Ironic, considering that the story makes a plot point that Gary, Indiana, is newer than Harold Hill thinks (or would rather have River City believe).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss">Dr. Seuss</a>' book <em>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</em>, that ubiquitous graduation gift. It must be from the 1950s or earlier, right? Nope. It was first published in 1990, and was the last thing he published before his death in 1991.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goldilocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goldilocks">Goldilocks</a>" must be a ridiculously ancient tale, right? Nope. It was invented by British author Robert Southey and first published in 1837, and in his version, the protagonist is an unnamed, ugly, elderly woman. An 1849 edition changed her to a little girl named "Silver-Hair", and a 1904 version finally named her "Goldilocks".
</li><li> The whole concept of writing itself counts: the oldest known written words (well, pictographs at least) are about 5200 years old. While this <em>is</em> a pretty long time from the perspective of a human lifespan, even the shortest estimates of the age of the human species (homo sapiens) are around 100,000 years old, meaning humans have only had writing for (at most) 5 percent or so of their existence.

<ul><li> "The Star-Spangled Banner" did not officially become the US national anthem until 1931. It might not have become the national anthem at all but for a letter-writing campaign launched by Robert Ripley, of <em>Ripley's Believe it or Not!</em> fame. (However, it was being sung at baseball games as early as 1918, and it was used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> even before then.) The unofficial national anthem to that point was what is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">now the vice president's song</a> "Hail Columbia". The piece of music to which "The Star-Spangled Banner" is set, though, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, being the tune to a drinking song, already comparatively obscure in Key's time, "To Anachreon in Heaven".
</li><li> Although there are a <em>very</em> few Christmas carols still sung today that come from the (later) Middle Ages, the overwhelming majority of most people's repertoires is modern. Even the genuinely old carols are invariably old <em>melodies</em> with modern lyrics, which make them sound much older than they really are. The list of "traditional Christmas carols that are actually younger than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em>" includes "O Holy Night" (1847, with English lyrics written in 1855). "It Came Upon the Midnight Clear" (1849), "Good King Wenceslas" (1853, though written to a 13th century melody), "Masters in this Hall" (1860), "O Little Town of Bethlehem" (1868), "In the Bleak Midwinter" (lyrics written in 1872) and "Away in a Manger" (1882).
<ul><li> 20th century Christmas tunes that might be assumed to be older than they are include "Ding Dong Merrily on High" (1924), "White Christmas" (1940), "The Little Drummer Boy" (1941, popularized in 1957), "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" (1944, with a melody by Mel Torm&eacute;), "Ring, Christmas Bells" (1947, based on the Ukrainian "Carol of the Bells", which itself only dates from 1916), "Caroling, Caroling" (1954), and "Do You Hear What I Hear?"(1962). "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" was created in 1939 as part of a marketing campaign for Montgomery Ward, and was first recorded in song ten years later by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeneAutry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeneAutry">Gene Autry</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://xkcd.com/988/">This XKCD<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> provides the timeline of many "traditional" Christmas songs.
</li><li> And then there's "Over the River and Through the Woods" and "Jingle Bells", both of which were originally about <em>Thanksgiving</em>, not Christmas. Respectively written as an 1844 poem and 1857 song, they only became associated with Christmas after the mid-19th century Little Ice Age ended and sleigh-ride-worthy snow in November became a rarity even in New England.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, secular Western music itself. Most music passed off as "medieval" is much younger. Some of the oldest tunes we know about can't be dated earlier than the 12th or 13th centuries; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads">Child Ballads</a> usually can't be definitively traced back before the 16th or 17th centuries.
<ul><li> The verse/chorus structure of modern musical lyrics is also a relative latecomer; it developed in Moorish Spain.
</li><li> The major/minor key structure is no older than the late 17th century- and orchestras in their modern form- certainly of more than about 6 musicians playing at once- were barely viable before that (because of the difficulty of pitching all the instruments to one another in the earlier model scale).
</li></ul></li><li> There are several reggae songs recorded between the mid-1980s and the 1990s that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">misattributed to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a> throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, when he actually died in 1981.
</li><li> Irish "traditional" song about the Potato Famine "The Fields of Athenry" seems ancient, but was only written in the 1970s by Pete St. John.
<ul><li> Related: The traditional highland lament "Ashokan Farewell", featured heavily on the soundtrack of Ken Burns' documentary on the American Civil War, was written by Jay Ungar all the way back in the 1980s, in the highlands of New York.
</li><li> The Skye Boat Song was written in 1884, 138 years after the events it commemorates and long after Jacobitism had ceased to have any status as an active movement.
</li><li> Similarly, <em>The Scotsman</em> only dates back to 1976, when North Carolina-based singer-songwriter <a class="urllink" href="http://mikecross.com/default.asp">Mike Cross<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> first wrote and recorded it, although the joke it's based off of is older.
</li><li> "The Witch of the West-Mer-Lands" dates to 1968.
</li><li> "Galway Girl" was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveEarle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveEarle">Steve Earle</a> (who's an <em>American</em> no less) in 2000.
</li></ul></li><li> Nearly everyone who hears Herman's Hermits' "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" assumes it to be a cover of an old British music hall tune. In fact, it was written in 1963, a mere two years before the Hermits recorded it. ("I'm Henry the VIII, I Am", on the other hand, <em>was</em> actually a cover of an old British music hall tune.)
</li><li> The lyrics to "Havah Nagilah" were written in 1918. The melody is older, but probably only by about a century or so (and it originated in Ukraine, not the Middle East).
</li><li> Similarly, "Katyusha", widely regarded as the quintessential Russian folk song, was actually written in 1938. Then, a rocket artillery truck got named after the song in WW2.
</li><li> The song "Edelweiss" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em> was written, in English, for that musical. It was later translated into German, and seems so natural in that language, many people have actually claimed to have heard it before the musical was written, and complimented Rodgers and Hammerstein on the faithfulness of their "adaptation". In fact, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, some folks even assume it to be the national anthem of Austria! In style it's close enough to Austria's actual anthem ("Land der Berge, Land am Strome") that it's a forgivable misconception.
<ul><li> Furthermore, the "Edelweiss" popular at the time the movie was set in was a Nazi marching song.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatmaniaIIDX">beatmania IIDX</a></em> songs "A," "AA," and "Kid A", despite sounding classical, were composed specifically for <em>IIDX</em>. "Piano Concerto No. 1 'Anti-Ares'," also from <em>IIDX</em>, takes this trope further, with a full eight-minute version that can be found on the <em>IIDX RED</em> soundtrack, and <a class="urllink" href="http://vjarmy.com/wiki/index.php/Piano_Concerto_No_1_ANTI_ARES#Music_Production_Info">a biography<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about its fictitious composer, Virkato Wakhmaninov, who allegedly lived from 1893 to 1974. The last paragraph of his biography mentions that Virkato performed the song on a "great keyboard and disc" (did this setup really exist in the early 20th century?) and that he spoke about an "arrangement for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">keyboard of seven keys</a>." Virkato is, in reality, an alias of Jun Wakita, one of Konami's in-house composers, and he composed this song in 2004.
<ul><li> The pseudonym should have been a hint of the song's true age; it's a pun on the name of Russian composer Sergei <em>Rach</em>maninoff.
<ul><li> And "Piano Concerto No. 1 'Anti-Ares'" is itself a pastiche of Rachmaninov's piano concertos.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The famous Adagio in G minor by Tommaso Albinoni (1674-1745) is practically an original composition by 20th-century "arranger" Remo Giazotto.
</li><li> The "Ave Maria" attributed to Baroque Italian composer Guilio Caccini (1551-1618) was actually written by Russian lutenist Vladimir Vavilov in 1972.
<ul><li> This is <em>not</em> the same "Ave Maria" as the one you're probably thinking of right now, which was either the one created by Gounod in the 19th century using a 17th century melody by Bach or the one by Schubert which was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em>.
<ul><li> And neither of THOSE were written as "Ave Maria" either. Gounod's was originally an instrumental ("Medidtation"), and Schubert's was a song called "Ellens Gesang III" (which started with the words "Ave Maria" but was a different text entirely). Incidentally, Vavilov's original was attributed to "Anonymous" and it was a student of his who perpetuated the hoax that it was by Caccini. Just one of the many musical hoaxes throughout the centuries.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana">Carmina Burana</a> are a collection of <em>poems</em> from the XII-XIII centuries. The music most commonly associated with them was written by German composer Carl Orff... in 1937.
</li><li> <em>Barrett's Privateers</em> sounds like an old sea shanty, but it was actually written by Stan Rogers in the 1970s.
</li><li> The song "New York, New York" popularized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> (the one that starts "Start spreadin' the news...") was written for the 1977 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewYorkNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewYorkNewYork">New York, New York</a></em>; since the film was based in the Tin Pan Alley era, the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">sounded like a tune from that era</a>. Sinatra recorded his version in 1979 and it became the final hit single in his long musical career.
<ul><li> In the same vein, the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago">Chicago</a></em> was composed in the mid-1970s, but set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties">1920s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>, with the music clearly evoking the era.
</li></ul></li><li> "Who Do You Think You are Kidding, Mister Hitler" was not composed during the War, but was written especially for the 1960s/70s TV Series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DadsArmy">Dad's Army</a></em> and sung by wartime entertainer Bud Flanagan. Most of the incidental music in the series are clips from genuine wartime songs, however.
</li><li> The Hokey Pokey, a.k.a. the Hokey Cokey, sounds like something that dates back at least a century &mdash; but it only originated in the 1940s.
</li><li> "Since I Don't Have You" sounds like it could be a classic Depression-era Tin Pan Alley ballad, and many people assume that it is, but it was written by the members of The Skyliners, who recorded the original hit version in 1958.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bluegrass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bluegrass">Bluegrass music</a> is a prime example of this trope. Although it has roots in traditional Southern string band music, it only developed as a separate genre in the 1940s. To put it another way, bluegrass is only about a decade older than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a>. Which, of course, means that many seemingly older-than-the-hills bluegrass standards are shockingly young. "Rocky Top", which sounds like it was passed down from generation to generation up in the Smoky Mountains, was written in 1967 (the same year <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AreYouExperienced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AreYouExperienced">Are You Experienced</a></em> was recorded) in Nashville. "Fox on the Run" was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManfredMann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManfredMann">Manfred Mann</a> song from 1969.
</li><li> "Greensleeves" cannot have been written by Henry VIII as urban myth commonly supposes, as it was written in a style which didn't arrive in England until after Henry VIII's death. Though the words and music do appear to have originated separately, it is unlikely Henry VIII had a hand in either. Though in this case, it's only <em>slightly</em> newer than they think: Henry VIII died in 1547, and the song had already been written by 1580 at the latest. By the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, it was already considered an old standard.
</li><li> Greek song "Misirlou", popularly known from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DickDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DickDale">Dick Dale</a> guitar version, sounds ancient but its first public performance of note was in 1927. It is probable that it was an earlier composition. It is equally probable that it was not <em>much</em> earlier.
</li><li> Pachelbel's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon">Canon and Gigue in D major</a>" was written prior to 1700. But it was first published in the 1920s, first recorded in 1940, and did not <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM">become popular<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> until the late 1970s.
</li><li> "Tomorrow Belongs to Me" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cabaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cabaret">Cabaret</a></em> has been mistaken for an actual (presumably translated) Nazi anthem, even by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">white power music groups</a>, but it was written specifically for the musical.
</li><li> "Highland Cathedral", which you'd be forgiven for thinking was a traditional Scottish song, was written in the 80s by two German musicians for a Highland games held in Germany. Ditto "Flower of Scotland", passed down amongst patriotic Scots over the centuries since it was written in 1965, and "Scotland the Brave", which is probably no older than the early twentieth century and whose most usual lyrics were written in 1950.
</li><li> Despite its current popularity in folk music, widespread use of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhr<!--C3-->A1n#History">bodhr&aacute;n<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as a musical instrument may be no older than the 1960s.
</li><li> Ever wonder why you don't see people sing "Happy Birthday" in TV or movies that often? It's because it was still under copyright until the 2010s.
</li><li> Many revered hymns that people assume must be hundreds of years old were products of the 20th century. "The Old Rugged Cross" and "In the Garden" were both written in 1912. "Just a Closer Walk With Thee" was first published in 1940. "How Great Thou Art" was written in 1953 (it's set to an old Swedish melody, though).
</li><li> The Swedish song "En Kungens Man", which tells the story of a medieval woman who almost gets raped by a knight, was written in 1974 by Bj&ouml;rn Afzelius, although many think it's an old folk song.
<ul><li> Similarly, the folk song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxDBeHY1Y7A">Visa i midsommartid<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", which many assume to be ancient (what with its references to witchcraft and paganism), was written in 1941.
</li></ul></li><li> Brian May and Roger Taylor (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>) frequently remark about how young fans are unaware that "We Will Rock You" hasn't been around since the dawn of time, or as Taylor puts it, "They think it's always just been there, written in stone." It was written (both words and music, the famous Stomp-Stomp-Clap) in 1977 for Queen's album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewsOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewsOfTheWorld">News of the World</a></em> and despite being a hit pretty much immediately, it was only released as a B-side to "We Are the Champions" in nearly every country. The only exception was a US radio promo 12" single which paired the two songs on one side in the familiar order of "Rock You" followed by "Champions," which is how they're often still played on rock radio to this day; you will almost never hear one song played without the other on American radio.
<ul><li> To clarify, the sequence of "Rock You" and then "Champions" also appears in that order on the album, but both songs were already hits via the single coming out months before.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a>, at least in its most literal sense. While self-identification in the lyrics has always been a part of punk, rap, and the earliest rock and roll itself, the same was not true of heavy metal. The term "metal" was first coined by the music media in 1970, but it was quite a while before any of the groups to which the genre tag was applied began using it to describe themselves; many even resented the fact that their music was being categorized. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a>, with their 1980 song "Metal Gods," were the first metal group to prominently use the term, and of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> were the first to incorporate it into the name of the band itself. Although for some, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a> because some assume that the genre didn't exist before the 80s or late 70s.
</li><li> While bagpipes of different kinds have been around since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges">Middle Ages</a>, the Great Highland Bagpipe (if you don't know the difference, it's what you picture when you think "bagpipe") didn't exist until around 1800.
</li><li> Many believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DropkickMurphys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DropkickMurphys">Dropkick Murphys</a>' "Tessie" is a direct cover of the turn-of-the-century fight song of the Boston Red Sox fan club The Royal Rooters. It is, in fact, a brand new song set to the melody of the original fight song and featuring lyrics about the Royal Rooters and their antics. Only <em>sections</em> of the chorus actually appeared in the original song.
</li><li> The steelpan, also known as the steel drum, associated with traditional Caribbean music, first appeared in 1937.
</li><li> Many people tend to think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FountainsOfWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FountainsOfWayne">Fountains of Wayne</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4&amp;ob=av2e">"Stacy's Mom"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> sounds like a song from the '80s or '90s, especially with that guitar hook that seems reminiscent of similar songs from the '80s (and the fact that the name "Stacy" peaked for babies born in the '70s, so if a song features a tweenage girl named "Stacy", it has no business being from anything other than the '80s). It's from 2003 (however, 2003 was still culturally part of the late 90s, so it's not THAT much newer than they think).
<ul><li> Likewise, you'd be excused from thinking the Silversun Pickups were a '90s alt-rock band thanks to their similar style, but they only formed in 2002, releasing their first album in 2006 and seeing "Lazy Eye" chart in 2007.
</li></ul></li><li> Lots of people are shocked to learn that "Long Black Veil" isn't a traditional ballad, but was written in 1959 by Nashville songwriters Marijohn Wilkin and Danny Dill, and was originally a hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> stalwart Lefty Frizzell. Dill himself called it "an instant folk song."
</li><li> "O Canada" has been used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canada</a>'s national anthem since 1939, but was not officially adopted until 1980.
</li><li> New Zealand only adopted "God Defend New Zealand" as an official national anthem in November 1977, despite having been written in the 1870s and having been used since 1940 as a de facto national song. The M&#257;ori version, "Aotearoa", was written in 1878, but only came into common usage alongside the English version around 2000.
</li><li> Likewise, Australia didn't adopt "Advance Australia Fair" as its official national anthem until 1984. Both New Zealand and Australia previously used "God Save the Queen", which would have been interesting at the Olympic Games if Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand were on the podium together...
<ul><li> Until <em>"Advance Australia Fair"</em>, <em>"Waltzing Matilda"</em> was a popular de facto anthem in Australia. The same goes for <em>"Pokarekareana"</em> in New Zealand.
</li></ul></li><li> "I'm a Little Teapot" is often assumed to be a traditional Mother Goose nursery rhyme from at least the mid-19th century if not older, but it was not written until 1939 or recorded until the early 1950s!
</li><li> The first mention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorosYFlamenco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorosYFlamenco">Flamenco</a> is from 1774. The Romani, who are commonly associated with it, didn't arrive to Spain until the late 15th century and were not considered citizens until (coincidentally) the 18th.
</li><li> Post-punk and synthpop were referred to as "New Wave" interchangeably in the 1980s (with "New music" also being commonly used). The differentiation of the two genres was not common until the 90s, after both genres had gone out of style. In the UK, New Wave originally applied to the power pop artists like Elvis Costello who came around the time of punk but did not have its energy or anger, whereas in the US, it applied to punk-influenced bands who had synths (Blondie, The B-52's and Devo being notable ones). Most people tend to associate it with synthpop these days because that is the predominant genre associated with the 80s.
<ul><li> The distinction between thrash and death metal is fairly recent too. For instance the band Kreator would have been considered death metal if they came around today, but were thrash in the 80s.
</li></ul></li><li> The "sirtaki" Greek dance popularised by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZorbaTheGreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZorbaTheGreek">Zorba the Greek</a></em> was choreographed specifically for that film, although it is influenced by a genuine Greek dance called the "hasapiko".
</li><li> The notion of sitting quietly in your seat during classical music dates from the mid-19th century. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> says that sneezes and coughs should be held until a loud section of music is reached (!), but talking and eating during performance was once commonplace.
<ul><li> Haydn's "Surprise" and "Joke" Symphonies were written, because of his annoyance at this, to startle or confuse his audiences.
</li><li> Don't forget that what we call "classical" music was, in its time, current <em>popular</em> music. Thus, opera audiences were often more boisterous than in the modern day, yelling at characters on stage, or singing along to favorite choruses. A particularly novel new piece of music that broke expected conventions might well be booed and hissed in the middle of the performance. And a magnetic solo virtuoso like a Paginini or a Liszt would have the ladies swooning in their seats like an early 60s Beatles concert.
<ul><li> Possibly (though what was going on in music halls and salons had more to do with the general pop scene of the 20th century- there wasn't really a <em>direct</em> equivalent out there before recorded music became possible and affordable)... however, the word 'classical' as it's now popularly used &mdash; anything where you shelve the record by who wrote the music rather than who performed it, basically &mdash; is not how it would have been used in 1850 or thereabouts. The 'Classical' era, strictly speaking, began around the end of the 17th century and finished in the early 19th. Puccini, Elgar, Schumann etc., technically didn't write 'classical' music, even when they wrote for orchestras.
</li></ul></li><li> The 'tradition' of silence during a concert originated by <em>mistake</em> with &mdash; like so much else &mdash; a request by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a> (mid-19th century) for the audience not to applaud between some key dramatic points of one of his operas; and even he was alarmed when it was interpreted as an instruction to be silent throughout.
</li><li> Wagner also invented the practice of darkening the auditorium for his operas &mdash; now almost universal practice in conventional Western theaters. Before this, the opera and theatre were yet another social occasion &mdash; the room would be well-lit because the audience would be in their most spectacular clothes and were there to be seen. The opera was more of a cabaret affair, with only the diehard musos in the audience giving it their full attention. This is partly why early operas have characters repeat their important lyrics over and over again!
</li><li> In theatre, not only was it was usual for audience members to talk (and heckle) freely during performances, they could also move freely around the auditorium, into backstage areas, the wings and even onto the stage itself. It was only in the latter half of the 18th century that David Garrick, in his capacity as manager of Drury Lane Theatre, began making the first moves to curtail this.
<ul><li> Some horrifyingly deadly fires (generally in the lower-culture, very crowded music halls) caused changes in the law that also mostly put an end to the open, cabaret-style auditorium with tables and loose seats, at least in such large venues. 19th-century 'lime-lights' (yes, a real thing, made from burning lime with gasses) had a regrettable tendency to start fires very quickly, and such auditoriums were impossible to evacuate fast enough.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>'s Theme" is a <em>very</em> iconic and recognizable piece of music that transcends the films in which it originated in a way. One could easily assume it's been around as long as the series has (since 1954, that is), but the theme didn't appear in its current, familiar form until <em>1991</em>. While the theme is in fact a medley of two tracks which date back to the first three films, you won't find the exact combination you've likely heard anywhere in the first <em>17</em> films.
</li><li> The song "O'Death" is often thought to be centuries old and maybe even from Medieval times, when in reality it is an American folk song from the 1920s.
</li><li> The opening ensemble that introduces the setting and all major characters and establishes the tone of the show figures prominently in classifications of the song types Broadway musicals usually have. However, this type of big opening number wasn't common until the 1960s; "Comedy Tonight" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AFunnyThingHappenedOnTheWayToTheForum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AFunnyThingHappenedOnTheWayToTheForum">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a></em>, though deliberately styled as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback">Genre Throwback</a> incorporating a lot of old shticks, is actually one of the earliest (and also one of the longest) of its kind.
</li><li> "Love Is a Rose" is not a hundred-year-old folk song. It was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> in the early 1970s. Likewise, the melody to "Slip Away" sounds like an antique ballad, but was written by Young.
</li><li> "Bolero" must have been around since at least the 19th century, right? Wrong, it was composed by Maurice Ravel in 1928.
</li><li> "Sabre Dance", composed by Aram Khachaturian in 1941, is widely believed to be a piece from the turn of the 20th century, due to its similarities to the 1900 piece "Flight of the Bumblebee".
</li><li> Since the folk band Patrick Street covered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PenguinCafeOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PenguinCafeOrchestra">Penguin Cafe Orchestra</a>'s "Music For A Found Harmonium" in 1990, the piece has become so accepted as an Irish reel that many versions credit it as "Traditional". It was first recorded in 1984, and composer Simon Jeffes died in 1997, so it will be in copyright for quite a while to come.
</li><li> "Yo Soy Boricua, Pa'que tu lo sepas" is a famous patriotic chant used by Puerto Ricans. Many don't know it comes from an actual song. A song by Taino that's from <em>1995</em> at that.
</li><li> The Czech, Moravian-Wallachian band Fleret, especially in their long collaboration with the folklore singer Jarmila &#138;ul&aacute;kov&aacute;, have pulled off their folk-rock blend so successfully that many people aren't aware that the song "Ove&#269;ky zab&#283;hnut&eacute;" isn't a genuine folk song. Jarmila &#138;ul&aacute;kov&aacute;'s experienced singing, and the fact it was released on an album that was half genuine folk songs, definitely helps to sell it. But the album was only released in 1995.
</li><li> "Baby, It's Cold Outside" owes most of its current status as one of the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs">Christmas Songs</a> to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">Revival by Commercialization</a> in the 2003 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elf">Elf</a></em>. Before then, it was just a plain old Great American Songbook standard, associated more with composer Frank Loesser and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAwardForBestOriginalSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAwardForBestOriginalSong">Academy Award for Best Original Song</a> than with the season (though a few singers had included it on holiday-themed albums). In Europe, it became a popular Christmas song only slightly earlier, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomJones">Tom Jones</a> and Cerys Matthews' 1999 recording (prior to which it was obscure enough that many people were unaware it was a cover version).
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a> recorded "El C&oacute;ndor Pasa (If I Could)", they assumed that the melody was an ancient Peruvian folk song. It was in fact written in 1913, and the songwriter's son successfully sued Paul Simon.
</li><li> "Spooky Scary Skeletons" is usually associated with the viral video where it plays over footage from the 1929 Disney short <em>The Skeleton Dance</em>. So one might be forgiven for thinking the song itself is of a similar vintage, or even that the cartoon and the song were always one and the same. The song, by Andrew Gold, is actually from 1996. The video combining the two was ripped from a 1998 <em>Disney Sing Along Songs</em> tape called "Happy Haunting Party at Disneyland".
</li><li> "V Oktabrye", the Soviet sailor song that appears at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHuntForRedOctober">The Hunt for Red October</a></em> is an old Red Navy song, right? Wrong. it was written or the film, by an American, in 1990, the year before the Soviet Union fell. Not that that stopped the Russian Navy from proudly adopting it.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em>Luftwaffe March</em> featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleOfBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleOfBritain">Battle of Britain</a></em> was not an authentic World War 2 march, but was written in 1970 specifically for the film. It simply sounds so much like the real thing people assume it is. Also, like the above, it was cheerfully adopted by both the East and West German airforces.
</li><li> The phrase "Dance like nobody's watching" originated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> song "Come from the Heart", written by Richard Leigh and Susanna Clark, first recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams">Don Williams</a> in 1987 and more famously by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KathyMattea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KathyMattea">Kathy Mattea</a> in 1989.
</li><li> The sea shanty <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_Sailor">"What Shall We Do With a Drunken Sailor?"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is usually associated with the era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>, but the earliest record of it dates to 1839, by which point steamships already existed. Furthermore, it appears to have been highly obscure until the 20th century, as it does not appear in any of the major 19th-century sea shanty collections; earlier versions were also much shorter, with the more colorful lyrics ("Put him in bed with the captain's daughter", etc.) being modern inventions.
</li><li> "Always Look On The Bright Side" was written for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeOfBrian">Life of Brian</a></em> in 1979; because of it's stiff-upper-lip message people have reported their grandparents remembering it from the Depression or WWII.
</li><li> The ukelele was first introduced to Hawaii in 1879 by a group of Portuguese immigrants, who also became Hawaii's first ukelele-makers.

<ul><li> The name Kevin is pretty old by itself, but it only became remotely popular outside Ireland in the mid-20th century and later (as recently as 1933 it was outside the top 1000 names in the US). So Captain Darling's first name is possibly the most anachronistic thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder Goes Forth</a></em>.
</li><li> Erin is often considered a classic Irish name and is therefore often used by Irish immigrants to honor their heritage. In fact, it is rarely used as a name in Ireland as it is a poetic name for the country itself. It'd be akin to naming your daughter America &mdash; it's been done but not very often.
</li><li> Colleen never appears in the top 100 names in Ireland itself. Not too surprising, since it means "girl, wench" and has only been a first name, outside Ireland, since the 1920s.
</li><li> And, while on the subject of Irish names, "Caitlin" is simply the Anglicized version of <em>Caitl&iacute;n</em> (note the difference in the second "i"), the Irish spelling of "Kathleen" (which itself is a variant of "Catherine"). In Irish, it's pronounced, roughly, "Kathleen". making its modern English-language usage a mispronunciation.
</li><li> Oscar, although dating back to an ancient Irish name meaning "friend of deer", was almost unknown until Charles XIV's son became King Oscar I of Sweden in 1844.
<ul><li> There also was an Old English Oscar, usually interpreted as equivalent to the German name Ansgar &mdash; both meaning "god-spear" &mdash; and part of a whole group of Germanic names beginning "Os-", notably Osmond, Oswald, and Oswin. Saint Ansgar or Oscar (801-865), first archbishop of Hamburg and Bremen, was known as the "apostle of the North". The name Oscar was popularized in the late 18th century by James MacPherson's literary forgery <em>Ossian</em>, which was where French General Bernadotte, later King Charles XIV of Sweden, got the idea to name his son Oscar.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Victoria</a> was practically unheard of as a girl's name in English-speaking countries before it became clear that Princess Victoria was going to inherit the crown of Britain. When she was given it, she was expected to remain an obscure minor princess: it was a (probably deliberate) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">Who Names Their Kid "Dude"?</a> choice.
<ul><li> Her mother Victoria was from Germany. Victoria and its variants were in use in continental Europe long before. (The name itself is of ancient Roman origin.)
</li><li> It's also commonly forgotten that Victoria did not become her name until she assumed the throne and she chose to drop her first name, Alexandrina.
</li></ul></li><li> Cedric, which is often seen as a quintessentially Saxon name, did not exist before Walter Scott used it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ivanhoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ivanhoe">Ivanhoe</a></em> in 1820. Scott seems to have misspelled the actual Old English name Cerdic (most famously a 6th century king of Wessex), creating the far more famous modern version of the name.
</li><li> The Russian name Svetlana may seem to have an ancient feel to it... and was first used in 1802, in an all but forgotten poem by Alexander Vostokov. It was popularized by Vasily Zhukovsky in 1813. Even after that, the popularity was limited by the fact that the church didn't recognize it until 1943 &mdash; by then, of course, few cared, but everyone did care that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Joseph Stalin</a> had a daughter named Svetlana.
</li><li> "Selina", too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bill Finger</a> used the name as early as 1940 as the "real name" of Catwoman, but only in the past few decades has it seemed to have acquired anything resembling mainstream popularity &mdash; and now commonly as "Selena" (to reflect the Spanish spelling), in a nod to singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Selena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Selena">Selena Quintanilla-P&eacute;rez</a> and actress-singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a>. Interestingly, the name is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>: it has its roots in the <em>very</em> ancient Greek term <em>selene</em>, meaning "moon-goddess."
</li><li> Jennifer did not become a popular name outside Cornwall until the 20th century. It is actually a variation of an ancient English name, <em>Guinevere</em> from Arthurian myths, but considered a peculiar local variation until, supposedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBernardShaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s play <em>The Doctor's Dilemma</em> where the character with this name actually does have to explain the origin of her name. But it only shot to fame in the mid-1940s, via actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferJones">Jennifer Jones</a> (born Phyllis Lee Isley), and even more by way of the tragic heroine of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveStory">Love Story</a></em>, released in 1970.
</li><li> Same case for Brooke, which did not become a popular name until the late 1940s, and, like Jennifer, it only shot to fame through someone famous, the socialite Brooke Astor (n&eacute;e Roberta Brooke Russell), and only became trendy through the fame of actress-model-socialite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrookeShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrookeShields">Brooke Shields</a>.
</li><li> Pamela was invented in the late 16th century, but remained largely unknown until Richardson's mid-18th-century novel.
</li><li> Vanessa was invented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift">Jonathan Swift</a> in the early 18th century as a nickname for his pupil Esther Vanhomrigh ("Van" from her last name and "essa" as a diminutive for "Esther"). It was first seen in print in 1726, but didn't actually become popular until the 20th century, though.
</li><li> Samantha seems like it should be an ancient name (perhaps Greek or Celtic or Hebrew). It's actually a British coinage first recorded in 1633, and it became more common in America than England in the 1700s, though it didn't really take off in popularity in either country until the mid-20th century.
</li><li> Jessica appears to have been invented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>, possibly intended to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign">Italian-sounding</a> version of the name Iscah from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a>, which was rendered "Iesca" in the most popular English Bible translation at the time the play was written.
</li><li> The name "Karen" only entered the English-speaking world in the 1940s; prior to then, it was a Danish diminutive form of "Katherine".

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Wrestling&nbsp;</div><div id="folder13" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> While people had been accusing pro wrestling of being a work since at least 1930 (there being evidence of worked matches as far back as the 1880s and the sport being <em>almost entirely</em> worked by 1920) the accusation that the pro wrestlers were actually all friends who hung out when not in matches wasn't even remotely true until the late 1990s and was still the exception rather than the rule until the collapse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>. (As late as 1970, some feds such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> had a truce in which wrestlers would agree to take photos together but it was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trucezone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trucezone">truce</a></em>.) Pro wrestlers not only were often hostile about "having to lose to inferior athletes" but even when they were amicable would still work as hard as they could not to be seen together in public if the were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">differently</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">aligned</a>, let alone feuding. Sometimes even babyfaces would avoid one another in public, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/AntiHero">given the degree thereof</a>. Wrestlers became more friendly as the business shrank, and thus more could afford to be and conversely, many literally couldn't afford not to be seen together, needing all the help on road trips they could get.
</li><li> In the post-territory era, most people seeking to enter the business are recommended to a "wrestling school", a fairly new concept that had its roots in the 1950s with areas such as the "Hart Dungeon", which weren't schools so much as the basement/attic/barn of some wrestler with a ring in it (if you were lucky). Before that and sometimes after, the standard practice was to simply beat on a promising athlete while no one was around the ring and if they kept coming back, actually start training them. By the 2000s, entire facilities dedicated solely to training pro wrestlers had became somewhat common, though even then, quite a few were still basically barns.
</li><li> Prior to the mid 1980s or so, one fall was not the standard pro wrestling match, as it would become in the majority of regions. In Mexico, two out of three falls is till the standard singles match and isn't even uncommon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">tag team</a>, tercia or even the wildest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">Gimmick Matches</a>.
</li><li> The concept of a "choreographing matches" is largely the product of the 1990s, namely a specific match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>, which was considered to be an instant classic. Traditionally, the idea was simply to decide who would win and who would lose, maybe a couple other spots and a time limit, with the majority of the wrestling being improvised based on how crowds reacted. Attempts to repeat the success of Hogan and Warrior through choreographing persisted well into the 2000s but remained mostly frowned upon by the wider wrestling community (in part because most of these efforts failed to live up to it, <em>including Hogan and Warrior's attempts to duplicate their own success</em>.)
</li><li> While the concept of a "tap out" had been around since at least the 1970s, these did not become common in pro wrestling until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Tazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Tazz">Tazz</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>, especially as far as USA pro wrestling goes, where verbal submission was most common.
</li><li> The image of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> with which so many people are familiar today (black tank top, trench coat, grinning cattle skulls on the tights, and a wide-brimmed homburg hat) was not how the he originally dressed: in earlier eras he was costumed more as a medieval executioner or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FlashGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FlashGordon">"Ming the Merciless"</a> type, or as a <em>literal</em> undertaker in a suit and necktie! He didn't adopt the "classic" look until 2004, after having spent four years as a basically non-supernatural biker. Furthermore, he hasn't worn the homburg or the trench coat or worn his hair long since 2012, but fans still picture him that way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow">The Big Show's</a> "Goliath" beard was not sported by him regularly until 2008, when he returned to WWE after many had assumed he had given up on the business to become a boxer; prior to that, he usually had only a thick mustache. Similarly, he was not bald until 2004.
</li><li> Monthly pay-per-views didn't become standard until the mid-1990s (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> did them first).
<ul><li> Similarly, weekly live wrestling television only dates back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a>. Monday Night RAW was often taped in its early years.

<ul><li> "The greatest thing since sliced bread" implies that sliced bread is an old, old concept. Pre-sliced loaves have been around only since 1928: <a class="urllink" href="http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/03/07/slicing-bread-by-machinery/">See the astounding announcement<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em>Modern Mechanics</em>!
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Abe Simpson</a> recalls, in his childhood, his father talking about America as if it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, adding that "Sliced bread had been invented the previous winter." Given that article's publishing date and Abe's record in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the comment was probably much more accurate than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">writers intended</a>.
</li><li> The phrase itself came about as soon as the 1930s; when it was originally used, it meant the "greatest new thing in a series of wondrous new technological developments". It would be like saying how something is the "greatest thing since the iPod" or "greatest thing since HDTV" today. The fact that the phrase stuck around longer than its cultural context is just one of those happenstances of history.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">"So...this is it, huh, folks? Sliced bread?? The fucking PYRAMIDS!! The Leaning Tower of Pi--even a LAVA LAMP!! What's the big deal?! You take a loaf of bread. You take a knife. And you SLICE the motherfucker! And get on with your life!"</a>
</li><li> These days the expression can be used with a touch of irony, underlining how ordinary sliced bread is now, as if to say, "This thing is not as great as it seems" by comparing it to mundane, pre-cut bread loaves.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, it underlines how much sliced bread was loved in America when it arrived- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillBryson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillBryson">Bill Bryson</a>, born in 1951, never saw an un-sliced loaf before he flew to Belgium in his twenties- "never even considered it a possibility."
</li><li> Oddly enough, the bread slicing machine wasn't a good idea in itself, alone, when it first appeared- a lack of modern packaging meant it went mouldy too fast to be practical. It was only when it was followed by cellophane that made sliced bread great <em>at all</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The myth that England will not fall until the ravens leave the Tower of London came from the 1800s at the latest, since the earliest reference to ravens being there at all isn't until 1885. It didn't become popular until WWII (when, apparently, the ravens did leave).
<ul><li> Prior to the ravens, the king's fate was supposedly linked with the lions kept at the menagerie at the Tower &mdash; Richard II fell fatally ill after one died.
</li><li> There is also the idea that Gibraltar will stay British while there are Barbary macaques there. In reality nobody gave a damn about the monkeys until WW2 (to the point nobody knows for sure *when* the first monkey arrived there to begin with), when the population had coincidentally dwindled to 7 and was about to die off, requiring the introduction of several new animals from North Africa. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Nowadays, the Barbary macaque is near extinct in North Africa but a pest in the Rock</a>. Maybe it's time to return the favor.
</li></ul></li><li> The idea that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day is an invention of the 19th century, although the separate ideas that Friday and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">the number 13</a> were unlucky are older than that.
<ul><li> According to a special about them on the History Channel, when the Knights Templar in France were rounded up as heretics on Friday, October 13, 1307, the infamous superstition began as a result.
</li><li> In most Spanish-speaking countries, the superstition is actually <em>Tuesday</em> the 13th, with the popular explanation that Tuesday (martes) is named after the Roman god of war, violence and bloodshed (as a matter of fact, the proverb <em>Martes, no te cases ni te embarques</em> ("On Tuesdays, don't marry or embark") traces back to medieval times). The Jason movies are sometimes retitled accordingly (until the recent reboot, that is).
<ul><li> The same is true for Greece, with the popular explanation being that Constantinople (modern day Instanbul) fell on a Tuesday (29th of May, 1453). 13 was traditionally seen as a bad number, since 12 was a holy/harmonic number in ancient Greece while another account attributes this to there being thirteen men present at the Last Supper (with Judas Iscariot as the unlucky thirteenth).
</li></ul></li><li> While the idea of Friday the 13th being unlucky has gained popularity in Russian-speaking countries, before that, being born on a <em>Monday</em> was considered to be extremely bad luck.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Curse of the Bambino", referring to the 1920 trade of Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox to the New York Yankees having a detrimental effect to the former team, was first referenced in 1990, meaning that it was believed for only 14 years before it was "broken".
</li><li> Robert F. Kennedy attributed the curse (which is one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">if you think about it</a>) "May you live in interesting times" to the ancient Chinese. There is no record of such a saying in China, and the curse in question can only be traced back to 1936.
</li><li> The proverb of the camel's nose is an invention of the mid-19th century Victorians, not Arabs.
</li><li> The first record of the proverb "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" dates to an 1884 political treatise by Gabriel Manigault, who adapted it from a Latin expression dating to 1711. It was not well-known until the 1950s, when the Cold War made it a guiding principle of American foreign policy.
</li><li> The saying "Be the change you want to see in the world" is <a class="urllink" href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/10/23/be-change/">first recorded<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in a 1974 book chapter by educator Arleen Lorrance; it was never said by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>.
</li><li> The saying "Hell hath no fury like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">woman scorned</a>" derives from neither the Bible nor Shakespeare; it is actually a corruption of a line from William Congreve's 1697 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestorationComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestorationComedy">Restoration Comedy</a> <em>The Mourning Bride</em>, which reads as follows:

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainbowMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainbowMotif">"seven colours of the rainbow"</a> as we know them derive from Isaac Newton's experiments in optics in the 1670s, where he first observed the spectrum of sunlight split by a prism. Finding that his numerological theories worked better with a seven colour spectrum, he convinced himself that the area between blue and purple was an entirely separate colour, which he named <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo">"indigo"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> after the blue dye. Since indigo is indistinguishable from blue and purple, it is possible that Newton's "blue" referred to cyan and his "indigo" referred to our blue, which would make more sense (other languages use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationCorrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationCorrection">Translation Correction</a> often enough). This can clearly be seen in the coin-op <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowIslands">Rainbow Islands</a>, in which the "blue" gems are cyan and the "indigo" gems are blue. It would also make indigo not being perceived as a real color <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Newer Than They Think</a>.
<ul><li> Thanks to the urban myth that "the" primary colours (actually the <em>subtractive</em> primaries) are "yellow, red and blue", magenta and cyan are sometimes referred to in the printing trade as "process red" and "process blue" respectively. This is borne out by a colour-mixing chart on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, which shows "red" and "blue" which are clearly what we now call magenta and cyan.
</li><li> Even Newton only managed to find seven colors in light separated by a prism (that is, under controlled laboratory conditions). In an actual rainbow, you'll be lucky to see <em>four</em> colors.
</li></ul></li><li> The notion that our universe is staggeringly big (even bigger than can be physically observed) is relatively new. Even in the 1920s there was still a heated debate going on among astrophysicists on whether the universe is the size of the Milky Way (other galaxies being just small objects within it) or whether it's bigger. (To put this in perspective, consider that, for example, the General Theory of Relativity was published in 1916.) The debate was finally put to rest thanks to the work of Edwin Hubble and others.
<ul><li> For the case, that the Milky Way is actually composed of many millions of stars too faint to be seen with the naked eye as well as that the Moon's surface is pockmarked by countless craters are something known from the early XVII century onwards, the former having been suggested it floated in the upper atmosphere as a sort of vapor clouds.
</li><li> On the flip side, ironically, the idea that the Solar System is of vast size is quite old. Diagrams of the old geocentric conception tend to show the Sun and planets moving relatively close above a huge Earth, but in fact Plato pointed out the size of the Earth could be treated as a mathematical point in comparison with the distance to the Sun.
</li></ul></li><li> The theory that a meteor strike was the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs was first proposed in 1980 by Luis and Walter Alvarez, and didn't become the orthodox explanation until the early 1990s.
</li><li> The idea that we may be "alone in the universe" is very new as well. For most of its time on Earth, humanity accepted that it coexisted with fairies, demons, ghosts, gods and other alien beings. The earliest observers of the other planets in our Solar System, like Huygens and Herschel, took it for granted that they must be inhabited, or God would not have placed them there.
</li><li> The Catholic Church first recognized heliocentrism in 1822. However, they simultaneously rejected and embraced (depending on who you talked to) Kepler's heliocentrism in the early 17th century, decades before they hired Galileo. Needless to say, Church history is annoyingly complicated. Note that Galileo's problems with the Church leadership had less to do with challenging established orthodoxy (which was actually science) and more to do with his being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> who would mostly back up his theories with "Because I'm smarter than you" rather than explain how he arrived at his conclusions. Since the Pope was financing his research, you can imagine how well that went over.
<ul><li> Note also that the early 19th century was the first time stellar parallax could be reliably observed. Before that, there was no conclusive scientific proof of heliocentrism.
</li></ul></li><li> The possibility of life on Mars was generally taken seriously until Mariner 4 took the first pictures of the barren Martian landscape in 1965; likewise, Mariner 4 ended hopes that Martian canals contained liquid water, Or, for that matter, <em>even existed.</em> They turned out to have been an optical illusion, which explains why the various sketches of Mars drawn by astronomers were so inconsistent on the canal patterns.
</li><li> The theory that mosquitos propagate malaria (and, as it turns out, other diseases) was formulated around 1880. For the longest time it was believed that the disease was caused by the "rotten" air in swamp areas, rather than by the mosquitoes breeding in them. Malaria's name, in fact, means "bad air" in Italian.
</li><li> While humans first domesticated dogs well before written history and have been selectively breeding them for at least that long, nearly every single popular breed of dog used today was actually first bred quite recently, during the mid-to-late 19th century. Advancing technological advancement among breeding as well as the extension of what were once aristocratic pastimes to the lower classes allowed an explosion in dog breeds in late Industrial England. Over a century later, most of the purebred varieties of the breeds invented here still preserved today have become deformed, inbred versions of their former breeds. Chihuahuas, for example, can only give birth by C-section, and most bulldogs have hip dysplasia and don't live longer than a decade.
</li><li> Seasonal allergies weren't identified as a condition until 1819. They were named "hay fever", after the mistaken belief that they were caused by exposure to recently cut hay (by coincidence, allergy season coincided with haying season). A link between hay fever and pollen was demonstrated in 1859, but the condition was still not really understood. It wasn't until 1902 that allergies were discovered. The term "allergy" itself was coined in 1906 and it didn't come into wide currency until the 1920s. All in all, an awareness that some people are allergic to certain things is only about one century old. One reason for this may be that allergies appear to have been rare in pre-industrial times, just as they continue to be rare in developing countries. Even when hay fever was first documented in the 19th century, it was considered to be a rare condition associated with the upper classes. A common theory is that allergies are an unintended side effect of improved sanitation, the result of immune systems attempting to compensate for the sudden lack of real disease.
</li><li> Cosmetic uses for Botox were first described in a 1992 journal article, and first legalized in the United States (via FDA approval) in 2002.
</li><li> Painkillers and anesthetics were not generally used when operating on babies until after 1987, as medical consensus before then was that babies could not feel pain. Little research was done into the matter until mother Jill Lawson discovered in 1985 that her infant son had gone through open heart surgery without any form of analgesic; she thereafter started an awareness campaign on the issue.
</li><li> Plate tectonics were first theorized in the 1960s and became consensus among geologists in the 1970s. Its predecessor, continental drift, was first proposed in 1912.
</li><li> Wind chill was only developed as a meteorological concept in the 1940s. The familiar "it feels like" temperature as the common use of wind chill in weather forecasts only dates to the 1970s (before that it was expressed as an esoteric three-or-four digit "wind chill index" number), and the most common formula for calculating wind chill was finalized in 2001.
</li><li> The common cold virus was discovered in 1956, before which the cause of colds was unknown.
</li><li> The first known use of the word "zero" in English dates to 1598, and its first use in other European languages was only slightly earlier. The 0 symbol representing zero was introduced to Europe c. 1200 (about 200 years after the rest of the Arabic numerals), but it was not widely used until c. 1450 with the advent of the printing press, after which Arabic numerals (including zero) rapidly replaced Roman numerals as the dominant numeral system. The concept of <em>zero</em> was imported from Arabic mathematics, which in turn imported it from India; classical mathematics does not use it, instead representing nothing as either literally nothing or as the word "nothing" (in whatever language.) Pre-modern mathematicians were generally suspicious of the idea of representing nothing with something.
</li><li> The theory of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter">nuclear winter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>&mdash;that is, the idea that nuclear war would lead to severe cooling of the Earth and result in widespread crop failure&mdash;was first proposed in 1983 by Richard P. Turco.
</li><li> The idea that the inherited traits of an organism were carried by a nucleic acid 'giant hereditary molecule' (later confirmed to be DNA) was first proposed less than a century ago in 1927 by Nikolai Koltsov. He correctly predicted the double-helix structure of DNA well before Crick and Watson confirmed it in 1953.
</li><li> Many veterinarians didn't consider anaesthetizing animals before operating on them mandatory until the 1990s except as a measure to keep them still; prior to then, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_animals#History">a lot of researchers weren't certain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that animals actually felt pain the way humans do. Of course, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHerriot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHerriot">James Herriot</a>'s books show, that opinion wasn't quite universal among the veterinarians themselves.
</li><li> Decimals were first used in Europe in 1585 by Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin.
</li><li> Considering the ubiquity of interplanetary travel in pop culture, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet#Confirmed_discoveries">exoplanets<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> must have been discovered a long time ago, right? Nope. The very first discovery of a planet outside our Solar System occurred in 1992, orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12. All but a few dozen of the 4000+ exoplanets now known were discovered after 2000.
</li><li> Chicken pox was not clearly distinguished from smallpox until the <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150207091230/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html">late 19th century.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<ul><li> The Irish pub owes its existence to early 19th-century licensing laws. Although inns existed in cities and large towns, most social drinking took place as "hostings" in a person's home, with music, dance, song and storytelling. This is borne out by the fact that the Irish language lacks proper terms for pub beyond <em>teach oil</em> ("house of drink") or <em>tabhairne</em> (tavern).
<ul><li> English doesn't really have a proper term for a pub, either; "pub" is short for "public house". (And historically, the term was used to mean "inn" or possibly "guesthouse." The term Shakespeare used for "a place where you go and buy drinks" was "tavern," which isn't used nowadays except as a cutesy element in the names of places like "Tavern on the Green.")
</li><li> Taverns/pubs in general are thought not to really exist until the early modern age, when mass industrialisation and urbanisation took place; most places for drinking and/or lodging would in fact be private residences. In a society primarily based around rural subsistence farming, there wouldn't be enough people to justify a separate business.
</li><li> The word "pub" is a recent addition to <em>American</em> English. Its popularity probably dates no earlier than the late 1970s, when the last restraints on American home-brewing lingering on after Prohibition (yes, which technically makes Prohibition fit this trope as well) were repealed and beer began to break out of its working-class social ghetto. The less glamorous terms "bar" and "tavern" were more common earlier.
</li></ul></li><li> Some TV shows set in the mid-20th century (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em>) have had a problem recognizing that the World Trade Center towers were only built in the 1970s.
</li><li> Thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec">Mayincatec</a> trope, the popular notion is that the European discovery of the Americas led to the downfall of the ancient, millenary Aztec and Inca empires. But neither empire had been around very long. They both just happened to be the most recent victors in the long series of power struggles in their regions. The Aztecs arrived in central Mexico and founded Tenochtitlan in 1325. To put that into context, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oxford-university-is-older-than-the-aztecs-1529607/">Oxford University was already over<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> three centuries old at that time. The Aztecs only won their independence from Azcapotzalco and joined the Triple Alliance in 1430 &mdash; that is, less than a century before Cort&eacute;s showed up. Around the same time, the relatively obscure Andes city-state of Cusco embarked on a expansionist campaign, and were still conquering territory around the time Columbus was planning his voyages. Meaning that the empire Pizarro encountered in the 1520s was only about 30 years old. In both cases, the empires fell in part because the fighting had been so recent that the groups defeated by the Aztec and Inca armies still wanted revenge and were persuaded to join the Spanish to fight them.
</li><li> The <em>entire continent of Antarctica</em> wasn't discovered until 1820. The idea of a vast Southern continent dates back to antiquity, but increasingly extreme expeditions South still turned up nothing but ice floes. James Cook's two 1770s expeditions into the Antarctic Circle seemed to confirm this, as they made it further South than ever, before turning back from the relentless ice a mere 75 miles from the still undiscovered continent, finding nothing. Popular scientific opinion ultimately accepted that it was all a myth for several more decades, and the longheld speculative name <em>Terra Australis</em>(Southern land) was eventually given to Australia in the 1810s, as it was deemed unlikely that we'd find a significant landmass any further South than there.... and then three separate expeditions over the course of 1820 suddenly confirmed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousAntarctica">mysterious Europe-sized continent</a> had existed all along. Which just goes to show.
</li><li> The Campanile in St. Mark's Square in Venice dates from 1912. The city fathers didn't have much choice in the matter &mdash; the original, dating from 1514, collapsed in 1902.
<ul><li> Older paintings do show the original Campanile to be identical to the present reconstruction, though. So at least fictional depictions of the pre-20th century square are correct about the campanile.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a> was founded in 1905. It didn't have legal gambling before 1931, and didn't become a major resort until after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.
</li><li> Chicago was only incorporated in 1833, by which time places like New York and Philadelphia were already two centuries old.
</li><li> How many bridges were there on the Thames tideway when Sir Christopher Wren (1632-1723) was alive and busy rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666 (and the river was tidal as far inland as Staines)? Just four: London Bridge (originally Roman), Kingston Bridge (originally Saxon, 21 miles upstream), Chertsey Bridge (12 miles further upstream, late medieval), and Staines Bridge (4 miles further upstream, Roman again). Apart from those, the only way across was by boat or by taking one's chances trying to ford at low tide. Then, in 1729, Putney Bridge was opened, followed by Westminster Bridge (1750), Walton Bridge (1750), Hampton Court Bridge (1753), Kew Bridge (1759), Blackfriars Bridge (1769), Battersea Bridge (1771), Richmond Bridge (1777), Vauxhall Bridge (1816), Waterloo Bridge (1817), Southwark Bridge (1819), Hammersmith Bridge (1827), Hungerford (railway) Bridge (1845), Richmond Railway Bridge (1846), Barnes Railway Bridge (1849), Staines Railway Bridge (1856), Chelsea Bridge (1857), Grosvenor (railway) Bridge, Battersea (1858), Lambeth Bridge (1862), Battersea Railway Bridge (1863), Kingston Railway Bridge (1863), Blackfriars Railway Bridge (1864), Cannon Street Railway Bridge (1866), Kew Railway Bridge (1869), Albert Bridge (1873), Wandsworth Bridge (1873), Fulham Railway Bridge (1889), Teddington Lock Footbridge (1889), Tower Bridge (1894), Richmond Lock Footbridge (1894), Chiswick Bridge (1933), Twickenham Bridge (1933), the M3 motorway bridge (1971), Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, Dartford (1991) and the Millennium (foot) Bridge (2002). Note that these are the years when a bridge first came into use on these sites &mdash; the current London <em>Bridge</em> dates back to 1973.
<ul><li> Neither of the current Hungerford Footbridges are the original, though the remains of the original (alongside the railway bridge, still in use) can be seen from the northernmost one.
</li><li> There were no bridges across the Liffey in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Dublin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Dublin">Dublin</a> until 1816 even though it was one of the largest cities in Europe at the time (bigger than Lisbon, Berlin and Rome and not far off Vienna).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a> was incorporated as a city in 1850, but was little more than a village until a few decades later when the railroads spurred a population boom. The urban area grew steadily after that, particularly after the 1906 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> earthquake, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that it became one of the largest in the United States.
<ul><li> Most likely San Diego, which is currently California's #2 and as the oldest European settlement in California (1769) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Neither Germany nor Italy were unified entities until the 1870s. Before then, they consisted of various smaller states that happened to share closely related languages<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note244l86');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note244l86" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note244l86');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the idea that all Italians or all Germans speak (or ought to speak) a single language with minor differences in dialect is itself a product of nationalist propaganda</span> but were often different culturally, and would often war against each other. "Germany" and "Italy" were used in the same way as "Arabia" is sometimes used to refer to the Arab region today. You'd say something like "The recent events in Bavaria will have a huge impact on the rest of the Germanies. Prussia and Austria will likely get involved" etc. When the first world war started in 1914, Germany was only 43 years old, having been founded in 1871.
<ul><li> This was, however, slightly stronger for Italy (despite the modern united Italy pre-dating the modern united Germany by enough years to make it the 1860s), what with Germany having spent several centuries ostensibly united into a Holy Roman Empire <em>of the German Nation</em>, and, even before that, the Kingdom of Germany as one of the constituent kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire; Italy was another constituent kingdom, but is easier to make a counterpoint to the counterpoint to the two nations being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Newer Than They Think</a>, what with only <em>North</em> Italy being, in name, part of said kingdom.
<ul><li> Between 1815 and 1866 there was the German Confederation (<em>Deutscher Bund</em>), which had central deliberating bodies (the <em>Bundestag</em> and <em>Bundesrat</em>) and a common military organisation (including some fortresses that were garrisoned and administrated jointly) that would have come into force had it been attacked from the outside.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Same for Greece. Before 1822, there were either Greek settlements scattered all over modern Greece (and, later, the entire Mediterranean), united by a common language, but never having more than a temporary alliance against common threats, or a single unit designated by foreign conquerors for the sake of more convenient ruling and taxing.
</li><li> The construction of Neuschwanstein Castle began in 1869. Although it is fairly well-known that Neuschwanstein Castle was built for (and left unfinished by) King Ludwig II of Bavaria, what is less well-known is that a large number of other castles, e.g. on the Rhine, were heavily reconstructed or even built anew in the 19th century.
</li><li> Cologne Cathedral, the biggest Gothic cathedral in Europe, was only finished in 1880. Before that it had been left unfinished for about 300 years until building was restarted in 1842.
<ul><li> Many other famous churches were restored in the 19th century, often receiving noticeable alterations. A number of churches had much lower towers until the 19th century, most notably Ulm Minster, which now has the highest church tower. Many of the gargoyles seen most often on postcards of Notre Dame de Paris were made completely new in the 19th century according to designs by Viollet-Le Duc.
</li><li> St Vitus Cathedral in Prague Castle was founded in the 14th century, but it wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century that it was finished in its current form.
<ul><li> The ruins of St. Nicolai church in Hamburg look like those of a gothic church made of stone, but that church was actually only after its predecessor &mdash; a brick building with a baroque tower &mdash; was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1842.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Both popular culture and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularHistory">Popular History</a> often lead present-day Americans to believe that the idea of families living in the suburbs took off rapidly after World War II, with all white Americans suburbanized by about 1960. In fact, suburbanization proceeded at different speeds depending on the location. Downtown Detroit, for example, remained largely white well into the 1960s. In fact, the majority of whites didn't even make it to the suburbs until the late 1980s.
</li><li> People tend to assume that the existence of the Vatican City State as the world's smallest country (with its largest church as guidebooks like to point out) goes back centuries. It makes sense, since Rome's ancient and so is the Vatican. Actually though, the Lateran Treaty establishing the Vatican's present borders was signed by Mussolini in 1929. The Pope <em>was</em> the temporal ruler of a (much larger) territory from the 8th century to its capture by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, generally referred to as the "Papal State" or (on older maps) the "States of the Church"; the core territory stretched across the middle of Italy, covering roughly the regions of Lazio, Umbria and Marche. During the 59-year interim, five successive Popes holed themselves up in the Vatican and refused to recognize the Kingdom of Italy. Mussolini came to a deal with Pope Pius XI in hopes of securing support for his fascist regime by the still-powerful and influential Catholic Church, a legacy which remains controversial.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25vz5v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25vz5v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25vz5v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In 1870, the Italian conquerors had offered to allow then-Pope Pius IX to remain sovereign over the Leonine City - a territory roughly double the size of the modern-day Vatican - but he refused.</span>
</li><li> The idea of the dungeon as a prison was actually developed in the seventeenth or eighteenth century. Before, the dungeon was a cellar, or, even earlier, the lord's tower (Latin, <em>dominium</em>).
</li><li> Although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of the shopping mall is widely disputed, it is generally agreed upon that its current form began in the 1950s and 1960s. However, food courts didn't exist until 1974, and they were still very sporadic until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
</li><li> The entire concept of going out to dinner is a 19th century invention (sometimes attributed to Del Monico's, New York, though this may only apply in the US). Before this period (by which time urban living was taking off and most people had disposable income they could never have dreamed of a century earlier), there were obviously places that sold food to be eaten outside of the home, but such places were regarded more as a necessity (for people in transit, or single people with no facility to cook) than a luxury (you certainly wouldn't be taking a date to one, not that dates were something the well-off did in this period anyway: going out alone with a man would be unthinkable for a respectable girl!). Any really good cooking was done by cooks employed in private homes. Social spaces like the tavern would be centered around booze (or, in some finer establishments, coffee). Some people attribute the idea to the results of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, which left a lot of cooks without employers, and an urban population that provided a big market.
</li><li> If you think two centuries of US presidents have sat in the Oval Office, think again. The Oval Office is part of the West Wing, which was built in a 1902 renovation. Prior to that, the President's office was usually located in either the Yellow Oval Room or the Lincoln Bedroom (in fact, the Lincoln Bedroom gets its name from having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s office). Furthermore, the Oval Office was first built in 1909, but destroyed in a fire a couple decades later. The current Oval Office was built in the 1930s, with a different design and location than the 1909 version.
<ul><li> Although the Resolute Desk was given to President Rutherford B. Hayes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> in 1880, it wasn't used by a president in the Oval Office until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> in 1961. It has only regularly been used as the presidential desk since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, as Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Bush (41) opted to use other desks.
</li></ul></li><li> Among government agencies, the CIA only goes back as far as the late 1940s (the OSS only started up in 1942). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePentagon">The Pentagon</a> opened in 1942, and was originally intended as a temporary structure. However, since the Potomac River is navigable, they decided to fortify it against naval artillery. This decision almost certainly saved some lives 59 years later.
</li><li> The current home of the US Supreme Court was also built in the 1930s, and in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">Retraux</a> style so that it would fit with government buildings built in the 1790s.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> is seen as an ancient civilization, a great part of its landscape, country and history is more recent than you would believe:
<ul><li> Despite being widely seen as one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal actually wasn't completed until 1653. For perspective, the Jamestown Colony had already been standing for over 20 years when construction on the Taj Mahal started, and the palace was barely 200 years old when India became a British colony. That makes it a contemporary of the Palais de Versailles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and Jainism are products of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age">the Axial Age<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoreVidal">Gore Vidal</a> noted in his novel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Creation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Creation">Creation</a> were rough contemporaries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius">Confucius</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a>. The first major Indian Empire, the Mauryas, followed the invasion of Alexander. Delhi, India's oldest active city, is a "mere" thousand years old (far younger than Rome, Istanbul, Damascus, Alexandria, Athens, London and Paris). The three other major cities (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mumbai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, Kolkata, Chennai) are colonial settlements raised to cities, and are essentially the same age as New World cities.
</li><li> For most of its history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism">Hinduism</a> was not called that by its theologians and adherents. They would simply call it dharma (i.e. beliefs or religious duty). Indeed the conception of Hinduism as a separate religion only emerged upon contact with Muslim and British conquerors. The word Hinduism in its contemporary usage comes from circa 1800. Similarly a major number of Indian festivals practised across India come from the 19th Century as part of nationalism, derived in part from previous such events but now dated on the Gregorian Calendar and more specifically organized to unite a broad part of the community.
</li><li> India's two oldest epics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMahabharata">The Mahabharata</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRamayana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRamayana">The Ramayana</a>, were first written down in the 4th Century CE during the Gupta Empire. The oral tradition and its influence on sculpture and temples dates it even further back in time, but its shelf-life as a written epic is far younger than that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer">Homer</a>'s epics (which existed in written form in the 5th and 4th Century BCE).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Russia">Russia</a> is the largest and most populous of all European nations but it is also the youngest.
<ul><li> Unlike other nations in West, South, Central and even Eastern Europe, Russia had little contact with Graeco-Roman civilization and its entrance to European history came from Vikings from the West, who as mercenaries/vassals for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a> and its vassal states like Bulgaria made Russia part of the Eastern Roman Empire's sphere of influence (and led to Russia's belated conversion to Christianity, specifically the Greek Orthodox faith).
</li><li> The Cyrillic Alphabet used for the Russian language was invented by the Orthodox Bishop Saint Cyril of the Bulgarian Empire, making the Russian alphabet younger than the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Old English, Norse leave alone the Chinese, Sanskrit, Persian and Mayan scripts and the Greek and Latin Alphabet from which the Romance languages derived.
<ul><li> As a minor example, what we <em>call</em> the Cyrillic script wasn't invented by Cyril but by a student of his at the earliest. What Cyril invented was the script currently known as Glagolitic - at least, that seems to be the general consensus since the 1850s.
</li></ul></li><li> Russian Literature is a good deal younger than other literary traditions of European nations. Indeed, modern Russian letters (its great poets, novelists, dramatists, short-story writers) are in fact contemporaries of American literature (who often feel that they are too young to have a literary tradition as great as Europe's. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleksandrPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleksandrPushkin">Aleksandr Pushkin</a> who is considered the founder of Russian literature was a contemporary of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordByron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordByron">Lord Byron</a> (a Pushkin favorite and influence), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFenimoreCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFenimoreCooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a>:
<div class="indent"><em>"The unusual thing about Russia is that it reached cultural maturity in the nineteenth century. Russia didn&#146;t have the Middle Ages of Dante and Chaucer, the Renaissance of the Italians, or the Elizabethan age of the British. They weren&#146;t even sure what language to write in. Pushkin more or less created the Russian literary language, and Pushkin was born in 1799. They were doing for the first time what other cultures had been doing for hundreds of years."</em>
</div><div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Richard Pevear</strong>
</div></li><li> Russian nationalists may like to claim Novgorod, Vladimir and Kiev as predecessors (to the horror of Ukrainian nationalists, in the latter case), but the modern Russian state is really an evolution of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy which became independent of Vladimir-Suzdal in the 13th century. Russia's expansion and the start of its influence on European affairs are largely the child of Ivan IV, who reigned between 1530 and 1584. Even then, Russia would not extend to the Pacific Ocean until 1639, would not displace Poland as the most powerful state in eastern Europe until the 18th century, and would not control some parts of Siberia until the 19th.
</li><li> Kaliningrad, a little Russian exclave located between Lithuania and Poland, only became a part of Russia after World War II. Before then, it was ruled by neither Russia, Lithuania, nor Poland, but by <em>Germany</em>. In fact, it had been a mostly German-speaking region since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">The High Middle Ages</a>. If you look at a map of pre-WWII Germany, you will see it had this peculiar exclave adjoining the Baltic Sea and barely cut off from the rest of the country by Poland. That exclave is Kaliningrad (or rather, East <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Prussia</a>). Before World War I, it was not an exclave and was connected to the rest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">Imperial Germany</a>, since Poland did not exist at the time. After WWII, the Soviets plucked the territory from the Nazis and expelled all ethnic Germans from the area, repopulating them mainly with Russians but also Ukrainians and Belarusians.
</li></ul></li><li> Egypt is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgyptianHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgyptianHistory">one of humanity's oldest civilizations</a>, so old that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">ancient to the ancients</a>. However, the modern capital of Egypt, the city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cairo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cairo">Cairo</a>, was only established as such in 970 CE. It included a number of other settlements directly adjoining each other (including the cities/royal compounds of al-Fustat and al-Askar, which date from 641 and 750 CE, respectively), but the oldest of them, the former Roman fortress/village of Babylon, only dated from the 1st century BCE <em>at the earliest</em>. It's true that a number of Ancient Egyptian cities were built around what is now Cairo (most famously Memphis, the first capital of a united Egypt, dating from the 31st or 32nd century BCE), but all the pre-Roman settlements were long abandoned by the time that Babylon was built &mdash; let alone Cairo proper.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frankenstein1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frankenstein1931">Frankenstein</a></em> movie with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BorisKarloff">Boris Karloff</a> (and other movies made in 1931 with and without Karloff) is older than the country of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaudiArabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walmart">Walmart</a> was founded in 1962, it was not truly a national chain until 1995, when they opened their first location in Vermont. Even as late as 1990, they barely covered half the country and were still predominantly a Southern chain. Likewise, they didn't start building "supercenters" (i.e., larger stores with complete grocery sections) until 1988, and did not really push to make all their stores supercenters until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>. Before then, most of their stores were only half to one-quarter the size they are now (although in some rural parts of the South, this is still the case due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a>) due to the lack of groceries, pharmacies, automotive, and other departments codified by the "supercenter" format. Also, any stores that had a restaurant in them likely had a cafeteria called Radio Grill or a scaled down McDonald's that only sold a handful of lunch items, not the Subway franchises with full menus that are nearly omnipresent in Walmarts today (the affiliation started in 2004). While the "supercenter" concept is now so commonplace with Walmart that the name is no longer used by the chain, the <em>overall</em> concept of a "supercenter" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, having been started back in <em>1931</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland">Portland</a> grocer Fred Meyer (which later expanded throughout the Western U.S. and is now a division of Kroger). Another company, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigan</a> chain Meijer, added general merchandise to its original grocery business in 1962 (the same year that both Walmart and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kmart">Kmart</a> were founded); Meijer locations still outnumber Walmarts by a fair margin in that state. Also, Walmart didn't expand outside the United States until 1995, when the first Canadian stores opened<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2684q9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2684q9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2684q9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the first few Canadian stores were taken over from Woolco, a division of also now defunct five-and-dime chain F. W. Woolworth; the U.S. Woolco stores closed in 1983, but the name was still used in Canada until 1995. Coincidentally, Walmart took over a few Woolco stores in the South and Lower Midwest as well</span>.
</li><li> Speaking of Walmart, sister chain Sam's Club and its main rival, Costco, were not founded until 1983.
</li><li> Considering how long some hotel brands such as Holiday Inn, Hilton, Marriott, Howard Johnson's, etc. have been around, one would think that most other hotel chains are of similar vintage, but this is not the case. For instance: Baymont Inn (1973 as Budgetel; renamed in 1999), Drury Inn (1973), Super 8 (1974, but still largely limited to the Upper Midwest until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>), Hampton Inn (1984), AmericInn (1984), and Microtel (1989). Newer still are America's Best Value (1999) and Magnuson (2003), both of which grew almost entirely by rebranding other properties.
<ul><li> Also, Holiday Inn did not introduce Holiday Inn Express until 1991 (although they previously tried the same concept in the early 70s as "Holiday Inn Jr."). Quality Inn similarly did not introduce its more upscale brands Comfort Inn and Clarion<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27zb25');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note27zb25" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27zb25');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">originally Comfort Royale</span> until 1982, nor its lower-end Sleep Inn<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28vvug');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28vvug" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28vvug');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle">Working Title</a> of McSleep, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> threatened litigation</span> brand until 1989. Finally, Marriott didn't introduce Fairfield Inn until 1987.
</li></ul></li><li> Shops as we think of them, where you walk around and look at goods displayed on various shelves, are a very recent innovation. Before the 20th century, virtually all goods were kept behind the shop counter and the customer had to request them from the shopkeeper. In 1916, Memphis store owner Clarence Saunders, convinced that letting customers fetch their own groceries would be more efficient than having the clerks do it for them one at a time, came up with the radical idea of displaying all the goods in a large shop area, through which customers could browse freely.
</li><li> A building didn't exist on the present site of Buckingham Palace until 1703 and then it was, appropriately enough, the home of the Duke of Buckingham. In 1761, George III purchased it as a private residence for his wife, Queen Charlotte. Under George IV, the building was converted into a palace. It wasn't until the ascension of Queen Victoria in 1837 that Buckingham Palace became the official residence of the British monarch &mdash; that's thirty-seven years <em>after</em> the White House became the official residence of the U.S. president. The fa&ccedil;ade of Buckingham Palace, including the famous balcony from which the royals wave at crowds, was first built in the 1840s and remodeled in 1913.
</li><li> Macy's was largely exclusive to the East Coast for most of its history (barring a few scattered stores in the South and California, plus failed entries into Toledo and Kansas City) until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, when it began acquiring a myriad of other department store chains in its merger with Federated Department Stores. It didn't become truly national until 2006, when it acquired the entire line of department stores from the May Company.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Poland">Poland</a> has existed as an independent country at various times throughout European history, the Poland of 1939 had only enjoyed about twenty years of independence before it was invaded by the Nazis.
<ul><li> When Hitler and Stalin divided up Poland, they were restoring a pre-World War I <em>status quo</em> which had stood for over a century. Furthermore, the Finland invaded by Stalin in 1939 had never been an independent state prior to 1917, about twenty-two years earlier.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note298ko7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note298ko7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note298ko7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It had been part of Sweden until it was conquered by Russia in 1809.</span> Incidentally, this helps to explain why Hitler and Stalin felt that they were entitled to territories from these nations &mdash; they saw them as illegitimate boundaries.
</li><li> Polish territory itself greatly evolved throughout the centuries and the territories comprising the Kresy (the area of land the Soviets took over, and today comprising modern day Belarus and Ukraine) was historically land that had been ruled by a minority of Polish nobility (under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PolishLithuanianCommonwealth">Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> where only nobles comprised a nation). The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is confusing for which parts of its makeup includes Poland, and which includes Lithuania, Ukraine, Latvia, and other neighbouring lands.
</li><li> Modern-day Poland's borders were drawn by the Soviet Union: its eastern territories were annexed away but, "to compensate" Poland and also to neuter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> from another invasion of the East, the Soviets bestowed to the new nation territory from Germany's Eastern Provinces of Silesia and Pomerania. The native German population was expelled (as well as from Czechoslovakia and other nations which were given parts of Old German territory).
</li></ul></li><li> While many clothing chains have been around for a very long time and evolved with the times, a few more are newer than one would expect:
<ul><li> Old Navy was founded by parent company Gap in 1995. (It was known as "Gap Warehouse" early on.)
</li><li> H&amp;M was founded in Sweden in 1947, but did not enter the United States until 2000.
</li><li> Forever 21 was founded in 1984, which already makes it young for a clothing chain, but it did not open stores outside California until the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
</li><li> White House Black Market was founded in 1985.
</li><li> Torrid, a plus-size clothing chain owned by Hot Topic, was founded in 2001.
</li></ul></li><li> And speaking of common mall stores, Bath &amp; Body Works was founded in 1990.
</li><li> The Crimean Khanate, the last monarchy whose reigning dynasty claimed direct descent from Genghis Khan, was not dissolved until 1783, the same year Britain recognized the independence of the United States.
</li><li> Churches didn't have seats until the 16th century; pews were introduced during the Protestant Reformation as a way to easily see who was present or absent, and to increase social pressure on churchgoers to not leave in the middle of sermons. The iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Confessional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Confessional">Catholic confession booth</a> was introduced during the following Counter-Reformation.
</li><li> Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world, was completely unknown to all but the local natives in the Venezuelan jungle until US pilot Jimmie Angel flew over it in 1933.
</li><li> Despite being named after the ancient Belgae people, the word Belgium wasn't used before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">French-inspired</a> Brabant Revolution in 1789, and the modern kingdom was established in 1831. Prior to that, the area was known as the Southern, Austrian, or Spanish Netherlands.
</li><li> The resort city of Canc&uacute;n, Mexico was established in 1974, at which time it had a population of 3 (as of 2019, it's now over 700,000).
</li><li> Not all major cities east of the Mississippi River were founded before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. Birmingham, Alabama wasn't established until 1871, and Miami, Florida didn't exist before the 1890s, with incorporation taking place in 1896. To put it another way, the medium of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film">Film</a> is older than Miami!

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports&nbsp;</div><div id="folder17" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Most popular sports were invented in the late 19th century, and their rules have little connection to their supposed predecessors, which were usually more disorganised and violent.
<ul><li> Similarly, the (false) claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">baseball</a> was invented in 1839 by Abner Doubleday "only" dates back to 1907, to the point where everybody except the people making the claim (who also were the ones deciding what was going to be published) knew it was bunk.
<ul><li> The fact the Baseball Hall of Fame, which was opened in Cooperstown in 1939 for the 100th anniversary of Doubleday's supposed invention of baseball, NEVER INDUCTED HIM should illustrate this. They inducted Alexander Cartwright (pretty much the guy who <em>did</em> invent baseball in 1845, if one wishes to claim baseball <em>was</em> "invented"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30uhvy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note30uhvy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30uhvy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To wit: Cartwright wrote the Knickerbocker Rules, which (1) codified a number of rules used for baseball at the time into a coherent whole, (2) innovated a number of rules (like getting runners out by tagging bases, rather than throwing the ball at them) that are foundational to modern baseball, and (3) were continuously modified by Cartwright through the 1840s and 50s, to the point where the Knickerbocker Rules, in their last Cartwright-penned iteration, were quite close to what we identify as modern baseball&mdash;largely because they had become the standard rules for New York-area baseball teams, which spread their influence via the <em>extremely</em> large contingent of New York-area <em>soldiers</em> who served in the Union Army during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a>.</span>) but not Doubleday.
</li><li> This may also double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, with baseball and softball both being variations of the traditional English game of rounders, which dates to around the 15th century.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In rugby union, the World Cup was first held in 1987, the European Rugby Champions Cup was first played in 1995&#150;96,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31defn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note31defn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31defn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Champions Cup actually dates only to <em>2014&#150;15</em> (!), but it claims the history of the Heineken Cup as its own.</span> and Super Rugby began in 1996.
<ul><li> A try has only been worth five points since 1992. Originally, the try was worth <em>no points</em>&#151;it only gave the scoring team the right to attempt a kick for 1 goal (i.e., point). That didn't last long; it became a separate score in 1875, but officially scored as a "try", with tries only used to break ties if teams had the same number of goals. In 1886, point scoring was introduced, with the try now worth 1 point. It became 2 points in mid-1891, and then 3 points in mid-1894. It remained at that value through 1970, increasing to 4 points in 1971.
</li></ul></li><li> The Korean sport of taekwondo is often assumed, like kung fu, to be unimaginably old, probably dating to early medieval times at the latest. It can be quite a shock to learn that not only is taekwondo ultimately <em>Japanese</em> in origin, but that the first tournament was held in 1955 (yes, that's A.D. 1955) &mdash; and that some of its earliest champions are probably still alive!
<ul><li> Taekwondo isn't alone: Judo was formed in 1882, and Aikido was developed in the 1920s and 30s, although both are considered ancient. Taekwondo and Judo are effectively competitive versions of much older traditional martial arts while Aikido was developed as a soft version of Aiki-jutsu which was developed by Sokkaku Takeda perhaps a few decades before Ueshiba.
<ul><li> Not only that, but the inventor of Judo was also the one who first came up with using colour-coded belts to denote rank in martial arts. And it wasn't until the 1900s that the system was expanded beyond simply white and black.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Olympic Games tradition of having people carry a lit torch from the ruins of Olympia (in the Peloponnese) to the site of the current games is not from antiquity; it was invented by Hitler's PR people for the 1936 Berlin games.
<ul><li> To clarify: this was the first time the torch was lit in Olympia, and as an official Olympic ceremony. In 1904, William Randolph Hearst sponsored a New York-to-St. Louis torch relay to promote his newspapers. This, however, was an independent Hearst promotion that the IOC had nothing to do with.
</li><li> The first Olympics with any sort of mascot were the 1968 Winter games at Grenoble, France, which had a character named Schuss, a skier with a red ball for a head, used for advertising purposes. The first official mascot created as an all-around symbol for the games (and for merchandising) was Waldi the multicolored dachshund at the 1972 Summer games in Munich.
</li></ul></li><li> Georgia Tech is considered an "old-school" member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) even though they didn't join the league (founded 1953) until 1979.
<ul><li> Similarly, Michigan State, which didn't join the Big Ten (established 1896) until 1950, seems to be treated as if it were always there.
<ul><li> The tenth school was originally the University of Chicago. However, a post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> funding crunch led Chicago to drop out of Division I sports to focus almost entirely on academics. MSU, which was expanding both its academic and athletic program at the time, went on a campaign to replace Chicago; they eventually got Chicago's blessing on account of their close academic cooperation (many Chicago graduates went on to teach at Michigan State, so there is some institutional connection). Also, MSU had always had a rivalry with the most prominent Big Ten school, Michigan, which (1) meant that MSU was usually on Big Ten schedules and (2) gave Michigan State an incentive to keep up standards athletically as well as academically (nothing like wanting to show up the in-state rivals who think they're better than you to motivate you to get up your game on and off the field). This has paid off quite well for the Big Ten; MSU has, at least in part because of a desire to keep up, become a bit of an overachieving school (in the sense of doing better than you might otherwise expect) both athletically and academically.
</li><li> Speaking of the Big Ten: While the "Big Ten" name has been used for most of the conference's history, it was founded in 1896 as the "Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives". The legal name didn't change to "Big Ten Conference" until <em>1987 (!!)</em>
</li></ul></li><li> UCLA's football team didn't start playing home games at the Rose Bowl until 1982.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note324lg7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note324lg7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note324lg7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Formerly they shared the LA Memorial Coliseum with USC, which explains the tradition of both teams wearing home colors when they play each other. When the Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles they made the Coliseum their home field, and not wanting to be a third wheel at the Coliseum (which is literally across the street from the USC campus), UCLA decided to move to the Rose Bowl, even though it's about a 40-minute drive from campus.</span>
</li><li> West Virginia's "Flying WV" logo debuted in 1980, when newly-hired head football coach Don Nehlen convinced the school that it needed a more distinctive icon (they previously used a "WVU" inside an outline of the state of West Virginia).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association football (soccer)</a> has quite a few:
<ul><li> Yellow cards and red cards were first used fouls in the 1970 World Cup. No cards at all were used before then. The cards were introduced because of incidents such as the one at the 1966 World Cup in the game England vs. Argentina, where the Argentinian Antonio Rattin refused to leave the field when he was sent off claiming that he did not understand what the German referee was saying and holding up the game for eight minutes (he eventually was led off by policemen). The idea for cards came when a referee saw traffic lights and thought, "yellow is "danger," red is "stop playing."
</li><li> Substitutes were not allowed in most tournaments until the late 1960s.
</li><li> Similarly, the black-and-white "truncated icosahedron" (black pentagons, white hexagons) soccer ball made of synthetics dates from the 1970 World Cup. (Before then, they looked more like what modern athletes would consider a <em>volleyball</em>. The old-style ball is still commonly found in club crests and logos, like those of Manchester United, Chelsea and Barcelona, and is still used in Ireland for Gaelic football.) That particular ball was named Adidas Telstar, after the telecommunications satellite. The idea was to make the ball more visible in black-and-white television sets, hence the black pentagons. The design was a geodetic sphere originally designed by Buckminster Fuller. It immediately was a great success, superseding the old soccer ball design almost overnight.
</li><li> The players' names were printed on the back of their shirts for the first time in the 1994 World Cup. That's the year where it was hosted by the United States, where the practice had been prevalent<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33s3hk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note33s3hk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33s3hk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">But by no means universal; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">baseball teams</a> in particular often left the shirts nameless, and to this day the New York Yankees still do.</span> in other sports for at least two decades. For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">NBA</a> (professional basketball) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> (professional American football), names on jerseys weren't optional. They were required.
</li><li> Replica shirts didn't go on sale until 1973 (Leeds United being the first).
</li><li> Crystal Palace didn't have an eagle symbol until 1971.
</li><li> The famous Brazil kit (canary yellow shirt, blue shorts, white socks) wasn't worn until 1953. Up until then Brazil wore all white (with blue collars). The reason for the change was that Brazil had <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_v_Brazil_(1950_FIFA_World_Cup)">unexpectedly failed to win the World Cup against Uruguay in 1950<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> playing <em>in Brazil</em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">whole country</a> fell in such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> that everyone agreed they never wanted to see a national side wearing white again, let they be reminded of that defeat.
</li><li> The first World Cup in which a win earned 3 points was in <strong>1994</strong>.
</li><li> The notion of the word "soccer" as an odd, exclusively American way to refer to the sport only dates to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Before then, it was quite common as a secondary nickname for football in England, much as one might call basketball "hoops." Moreover, the word was coined in England, being a classic example of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_-er">"-er" shortening characteristic of Oxford graduates<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (it's the same process that gave us "rugger" for rugby football as well as "fiver" for a five-pound note, "brekker" for breakfast, and "Macca" for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>). It also in widespread use in other Anglophone countries where association football isn't the primary sport; besides the U.S., Canada and Australia have their own football codes, while New Zealand mostly goes for rugby (as does a good chunk of Australia, though mostly under a different code from NZ), and all use "soccer" to refer to association football as much as the Americans.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> has a few:
<ul><li> Similar to the Association Football example above, the practice of putting players' names on the backs of jerseys originated with the AFL in the 60s, and wasn't adopted by the NFL until the two leagues merged. Look at pictures from the first couple of Super Bowls, and you'll find that the AFL teams have names on the jerseys while the NFL teams don't.
</li><li> Some teams with "classic" uniforms have only been using those uniforms relatively recently. The Green Bay Packers (famous for their Green and Gold color scheme) started playing in the 1920s, for example, but didn't even wear green until the 50s and they didn't wear the famous "G" logo on their helmets until 1961. Before then, they actually wore <em>navy blue</em> uniforms.
</li><li> The Chicago Bears and Soldier Field have both been Windy City institutions since the early 1920s, but the Bears only started playing home games there in 1971, when the NFL mandated a minimum of 50,000 seats for home stadiums, forcing the Bears to leave Wrigley Field (where they'd played since 1921).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> itself. Not only was it not called that officially until 1970. It was also <em>not sold out</em> in its first edition and considered something of an anti-climax as nobody took the AFL entrant seriously. Until the New York Jets showed the AFL had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Grown The Beard</a> in Super Bowl III where the NFL Baltimore Colts never got a foot on the ground. Oh and the Vince Lombardi Trophy? Not called that in the first four Super Bowls, either &mdash; it got its name in memory of the Green Bay coach who won the first two, who died just before the start of the 1970 season.
<ul><li> The tradition of presenting the Lombardi Trophy to the winning Super Bowl team onfield after the game only began with Super Bowl XXX in 1996. Before that, the trophy would be brought to the winning team's locker room.
</li></ul></li><li> And before that, Playoffs. The first few NFL winners were simply the team who had the best standing after the season &mdash; there were no divisions or conferences for more than a decade. Sometimes the winner and runner up did not even face each other (the schedule being even weirder than now). Only in 1932 when two teams had the same win/loss record did a "one-off" Playoff for the title take place. The game drew quite a crowd and by the next year it had become a permanent fixture (with the league split into two conferences) and the NFL has held a title game ever since.
</li><li> In NFL games, the goalpost was located at the <em>front</em> of the endzone until 1974, when it was moved to the back.
</li><li> Prior to the 1972 season, ties were statistically ignored in computing winning percentages. Starting in 1972, ties were mathematically counted as a half-win and half-loss for teams.
</li></ul></li><li> The three-point shot in basketball. It has been used by various leagues since the 30s but didn't get adopted by the National Basketball Association until the 1979-80 season. And not by the NCAA until 1985 (although individual conferences fiddled with it beforehand).
</li><li> Similarly, the NFL didn't have the option for a 2-point conversion until the 1994 season, although college football had adopted it nearly 40 years earlier while the AFL had used it for its entire existence.
</li><li> Cheerleading dates back to the end 19th century but cheerleading as a female high school student activity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader">let alone</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCheerleader">the</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGuysWantCheerleaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGuysWantCheerleaders">female high school student activity</a>) is much more recent. It was not until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> that female cheerleaders started to outnumber males and was still considered sufficiently masculine as late as the early 1960s that all-male high schools had cheerleading squads &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/061000wh-bush.html">was head cheerleader at his boarding school.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The idea of having gold, silver and bronze to represent first, second and third place made its first appearance in 1904, with the medals awarded at the 1904 St. Louis Olympics.
<ul><li> The idea of having a second and third place at all in the Olympics. In the ancient Games, you either won and got all the glory, or you lost and went home in utter shame.
</li></ul></li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">the legend that inspired it had been around for a very long time</a>, the marathon race was invented for the inaugural Modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> in 1896 and the distance wasn't standardised until 1921.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">NHL</a> has a group of six teams (Montreal, Toronto, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, New York Rangers) called the "Original Six". However, only the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34y06x');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note34y06x" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34y06x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> who weren't actually called the "Maple Leafs" until 1927; prior to that, they were the Toronto Hockey Club (1917-19; sometimes nicknamed "Blueshirts" or "Torontos" at the time, but retroactively designated the "Arenas" after their original owners) and the St. Patricks (1919-27) </span> existed in 1917, when the NHL was founded. Those two teams, along with the Ottawa Senators, Montreal Wanderers, and the Quebec Bulldogs, were the charter members of the NHL. The Senators are not considered an old team, however, as the original incarnation died in 1934, and the name was only reused in 1992. Boston entered in 1924; the three others joined in 1926. After that expansion, however, there were a total of 10 teams in the league. The Great Depression thinned the herd, and by 1942, only the Original Six were left. The term itself came about as a result of the 1967 expansion in which the league doubled to twelve teams, and as the league expanded further, the term stuck.
</li><li> The custom of playing the national anthem before sporting events began in World War II, as a patriotic gesture during baseball games. The tradition remains strongly associated with North American sports and is seldom performed in other countries.
<ul><li> More accurately, this custom is seldom performed for domestic league matches outside North America. However, it's now standard for matches between national teams.
</li><li> Similarly, baseball's seventh inning stretch use of "God Bless America" was popularized after the 9/11/2001 attacks.
</li><li> The custom of NFL players standing onfield during the national anthem only began in 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon">as the U.S. Department of Defense started paying the NFL for patriotic displays</a>. Prior to 2009, most teams would wait in the locker room before running onfield as the song ended.
</li></ul></li><li> While its constituent schools were founded between 1636 and 1865, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvyLeague">Ivy League</a> was not formally constituted until 1945 in football and 1954 in other sports; in fact, the description of certain schools as "ivy colleges" dates back only to the 1930s.
</li><li> Even though the NBA adopted the shot clock in 1954, women's college basketball didn't adopt it until 1971, and men's college basketball not until 1985.
</li><li> The Super Bowl halftime shows didn't become the star-driven spectacles they're now known as until 1993, when Michael Jackson hosted. The NFL brought in a big-name star year specifically to prevent viewers from switching the channel, as they often had during the halftime shows of previous years, which consisted largely of marching bands.
<ul><li> Another aspect of the Super Bowl telecast that's probably newer than a lot of people think is the commercials being a highly anticipated part of it. While Apple realized the potential for Super Bowl advertising with its famous 1984 ad, it wasn't until around 2000 that the commercials became a highly anticipated part of the Super Bowl viewing experience.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Gatorade shower" tradition in American football, wherein a cooler full of Gatorade or some other sports drink is poured over the winning coach's head, dates back to a Giants-Redskins match on October 28, 1984.
</li><li> Twenty20 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricket</a> was only invented in 2002, with the first match being played in 2003 and the first international match played in 2005.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueBaseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueBaseball">Major League Baseball</a> has only been a single legal entity since 2000; before then, the National and American Leagues had separate offices and administration and MLB was, at least officially, a regulatory organization rather than a league. National and American League teams never played against each other in meaningful games, aside from the World Series, until 1997.
</li><li> In athletics, the long jump was known as the "broad jump" until the 1968 Olympics, when its name was changed to avoid using the sexist slur "broad".
</li><li> Yellow tennis balls were first introduced in 1972 so that they could be better seen on television; before then, tennis balls were usually black or white.
</li><li> While NFL quarterback Brett Favre is most likely to evoke nostalgia of 1990s football, he was actually active as recently as 2010.
</li><li> With the kickflip being one of the most basic skateboarding tricks one can learn, one might think that the trick was invented way back in the early days of skateboarding during the 70s. However, it was actually invented in <em>1982</em>, by skateboarding legend Rodney Mullen. The 540 shuv-it was actually <em>a few years older</em>, having been invented in 1979.
</li><li> The Big 5, the top Division I college basketball teams in Philadelphia (La Salle, Pennsylvania, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova) have played each other for over a century, but it only became an organized rivalry in 1955, and they only restarted a full single round robin series with each other in 1999, after going on hiatus in 1991.

<ul><li> Although the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was chartered in 1861, the use of "technology" to mean "productivity-improving inventions" dates to no earlier than the 1930s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleanPrettyReliable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleanPrettyReliable">CPR</a> and mouth-to-mouth have only been around in any recognizable form since the late 1940s, and didn't become standard medical techniques for another decade. (Witness an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> where a crowd stands dumbfounded as Sam performs mouth-to-mouth on a nearly drowned boy, circa 1954. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em>, Marty tells a crowd in 1955 that he knows CPR and gets the reply "What's CPR?". An episode of <em>Eureka</em> has Alison perform CPR in 1945 on a wounded soldier while everyone around her assumes she is kissing him.) Contrast the actually made-in-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey">Mighty Whitey</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/enterprise/star_trek_the_original_series_8.php?page=4">episode<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which features whatever-they-did-before-CPR.
<ul><li> Similarly, the Heimlich maneuver was first described circa 1974. It was likewise used anachronistically by Sam in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em>, on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalInJoke">Dr. Heimlich himself</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, paramedics and EMTs as we know them weren't around until the late 60s and early 70s. The TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency">Emergency!</a></em> helped popularize the concept in the public's mind.
</li><li> Similarly, the use of 911 in North America was not the standard emergency number (though it was the most common) until the 1990s as was knowledge that such emergency systems even existed. The popularity of the television series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rescue911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rescue911">Rescue 911</a></em> re-enacting emergency calls with the actual victims and first responders pushed the system into the public conscious and made most of the communities without it switch to accept emergency calls from that number in addition to their own (many after a few segments specifically pointed out that the panicked caller had to leaf through the phone book to find the correct number). The series' international popularity is part of the reason that some foreign countries use 911 as a secondary emergency service number after their own citizens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">thought that it would work for them too.</a> In fact, it's not uncommon for shows as late as the mid-90s to have to leave babysitters a list of emergency numbers on the fridge, which most viewers would wonder why the parents would leave their children in the care of someone who doesn't know 911.
</li></ul></li><li> The first practical chastity belt wasn't invented until the late 1500s. And they were <a class="urllink" href="http://www.occasionalhell.com/infdevice/detail.php?recordID=Chastity%20Belt">never very common<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> even then.
</li><li> Adhesive tape. Though technically invented in 1928, up until the 1960s it was common to see packages tied with string, as featured in "My Favourite Things" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em>, and the logo used by UPS through the mid-2000s featured a twine-tied parcel.
</li><li> Iron Maidens (torture device resembling a coffin full of spikes) were not invented until the late 18th Century, and have most likely never been used on anyone ever.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">Sadly, this is no longer true. After the 2003 occupation of Iraq, a working Iron Maiden was found in the dungeons of Uday Hussein.</a>
</li><li> It also might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, since the Spartan tyrant Nabis was reported to use a nail-studded statue of his wife, capable of giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyHug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyHug">Deadly Hugs</a> to anyone he wanted dead... or simply needed money from.
</li></ul></li><li> Although the idea of a hot-air balloon had been kicking around for quite a while, proof of concept was not shown until 1709 by Brazilian priest Bartolomeu de Gusmao, and the first manned balloon flight didn't happen until the Montgolfier brothers in 1783.
</li><li> The piano was invented in 1709 and didn't become popular till the mid 19th century; people preferred the softer sound of the Harpsichord. But because of that, the piano may actually be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a> since the harpsichord is pictured as the main instrument of the 17th century. The harpsichord was still used in new compositions into the early 20th century for bass recitatives but after the early 19th century, its use was mostly restricted to older works written for the harpsichord. The mid-19th century and onward harpsichord revival, despite popular myth, was not the revival of a forgotten instrument but an act of preserving an instrument that was in danger of falling into obscurity.
<ul><li> The reason it was invented lies in its full name: The <em>pianoforte</em>. Whereas the harpsichord was the same volume no matter the pressure one struck its keys, the new instrument could be varied in its sound volume, which contributed to its popularity rise. After many composers began to use the piano in the late 18th and early 19th century, the harpsichord was quickly pushed aside for limited use only.
<ul><li> On the other hand, despite its low volume, a harpsichord has considerable power to 'cut through' the orchestra, which is why it was used for 'continuendo' bass lines until the mid 19th century. By this time orchestras were much larger and the style had moved on, not usually using a strictly-marked pulse in the bass (and having more options when it did, with new instruments like the trombone, new percussion or the modern form of the double bass.)
</li><li> The new keyboard instrument had considerable competition in the <em>harp</em>, and for a while it looked like keyboard instruments were going to be eclipsed entirely. It doesn't hurt that a shapely young woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">looks better</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpOfFemininity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpOfFemininity">playing a harp</a> than a piano.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Matches lit by striking were invented in 1827, although primitive forms of the match have been around before that. However, depictions of strike matches in the middle ages are just plain wrong. However, another lighting technology assumed to be ancient, actually is, and is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, that being the oil lamp, which dates back 7,000 years.
<ul><li> Which may also make it <em>Older</em> Than They Think, depending on what They Think, though if <em>they</em> are dating matches as "older than lighters," matches are indeed newer than they think, by at least a few years, and if they're dating matches as a very old technology, they are very very wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> The first Ferrari road car was built in 1947, when Enzo Ferrari was nearly fifty and the motor car was over eighty.
<ul><li> Similarly the first Lamborghini arrived in 1962. Mazda cars also date from the early 'sixties. And lets not forget the Lexus brand was launched in 1989.
</li></ul></li><li> Online games didn't exist until the late 90s- ones before that were quite <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_massively_multiplayer_online_games">strange.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Television is both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a> &mdash; the so-called "Baird" (Nipkow) system, although the first system used, was recognised even at the time as having no long-term viability. Television <em>as we know it today</em> was the combined effort of several people over at least four decades, but the final piece of the jigsaw is said (by Britain's Royal Television Society amongst others) to have been invented by RCA's Vladimir Zworykin in the mid-1930s.
<ul><li> Baird cottoned on pretty quickly afterwards though, and managed to get colour television working in 1944, which had 600 line definition and triple-interlacing, more than 3 decades ahead of its actual implementation.
</li></ul></li><li> The naval battleship that we're all familiar with (armoured steel hull and deck, gun turrets with heavy guns) first appeared in 1906 with the launch of the HMS <em>Dreadnought</em> (although vessels like the 1899 <em>Royal Sovereign</em> class had all three features, just less well done). The term "battleship" came into use about ten years before that.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMillionBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMillionBC">popular depictions of the Stone Age</a> show a stone wheel being invented by a caveman and immediately used for transportation. In the location where the wheel was invented (the Middle East), people had moved out of caves by 13,000 BC and were living in fixed settlements by 12,000 BC. Yet, the wheel was invented no earlier than 6,000 BC and would only be used for grinding grain or shaping pottery for another two or three millenia. In reality, there weren't enough raw materials nor was there a need for a wheeled vehicle, and even then, the main application was for warfare. The passenger vehicle of the ancient world was called a litter, and was carried by human slaves.
<ul><li> Rickshaws, transportation carts powered by people, sound like a concept that's been around for centuries. They were invented in 1873.
</li></ul></li><li> Stirrups are ubiquitous in shows set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientGrome">Ancient Grome</a> for security purposes, but they actually didn't arrive to Europe until a couple of centuries after Rome's fall. Roman riders used horned saddles to secure themselves instead.
</li><li> The katana is always thought to be the weapon of the samurai. Not always so&mdash;the katana as we know it wasn't really perfected until sometime in the Muromachi period (1333-1467). Before that, the common sword was either the tachi or uchigatana.
<ul><li> More so, the idea that any sword is the symbol of the samurai class originates in Edo period (17th century). For the greater part of feudal era the samurais essentially were the mounted archers, thus their respective symbols were a steed and a bow. During the Warring States Period (16th-17th centuries) most samurais weren't able to afford a steed, but the bow was still the main weapon on the battlefield. And for the melee combat their first choice was either a spear or a naginata. Swords were limited to the "last chance weapon" role, just like modern soldiers may have a knife in addition to an assault rifle. Only when all of the feudal military conflicts ended samurais started to carry around swords for the purpose of showing their status.
<ul><li> The same is largely true in the West as well. Spears, pikes, and similar were always much more common as weapons - not only do they have better reach and can be used in tight formations where there is no room to swing a sword, they are also much cheaper and easier to produce (sticks are common, metal is expensive). The idea of Medieval warriors hacking at each other with swords and axes is a modern invention, with such weapons mostly being used only as fallback should the main weapon be lost.
</li></ul></li><li> Katana-type swords used by World War II Japanese military is even newer. They were issued only from 1935-45, as part of neonationalistic propaganda, thus the name <em>shin-gunto</em> ("new military sword"). The previous Western and fusion designs now collectively called <em>kyu-gunto</em> ("old military sword") were issued for almost six times as long.
</li></ul></li><li> The "soup bowl" cutlass hilt was invented in the Napoleonic period, roughly 80 years after the last phase of the Golden Age of Piracy (when Blackbeard and his famous contemporaries were active). Seafarers in the GAoP did use cutlasses, with a wide variety of hilts - but not that one.
</li><li> The windmill, the wheelbarrow and the heavy (iron) plow are all Medieval inventions. The Romans didn't have them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a> don't look so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges">dung ridden</a> now, huh?
<ul><li> The same goes, by the way, for the <em>spinning wheel</em>, which we think of as being beyond ancient, but was really invented in the 11th century. Prior to that, thread was made with spindles.
</li></ul></li><li> Forks were almost unheard of outside Italy before the 16th century and not universally used before the 18th; before then, almost all of Europe, across all social strata, ate food with their hands, a knife and a spoon.
</li><li> The traditional, spring-loaded mousetrap was invented in 1894.
</li><li> The very first commercial camcorder was released in 1981.
<ul><li> Which may also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a> seeing as how Super 8 cameras were still widely sold until the late 80s and some stores still carried them as late as 1992. However, the Super 8 itself in turn may be this, only having been invented in 1965.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of pharmaceuticals we take for granted today have only been invented in the last 40 years:
<ul><li> Paracetamol/acetaminophen (Panadol/Tylenol) was first sold in the US in 1953 and the UK in 1955.
</li><li> Salbutamol/albuterol, commonly used in asthma relievers, was first sold in the UK in 1968. It wasn't sold in the US until May 1982.
</li><li> The antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) was approved for sale in December 1987.
</li><li> Viagra (sildenafil), the first-ever erectile dysfunction remedy, was approved for sale in March 1998.
</li><li> It's incredible to contemplate now, but there are still people alive today who remember a time before antibiotics. Penicillin was not (re-)discovered until 1928, and it wasn't in widespread use until after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondWorldWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondWorldWar">Second World War</a>. In other words, what are now treatable illnesses had a very real risk of death even as late as our grandparents' generation.
</li></ul></li><li> The term "GPU" was popularized in 1999 by Nvidia as a marketing gimmick for the Geforce 256; before then, it was usually "graphics card", "graphics accelerator", or some other term with "accelerator".
</li><li> Many Internet technologies we take for granted today haven't been around for as long as the Internet itself:
<ul><li> Mail Exchange addresses only became commonplace in the mid-90s; before that you had to address messages directly to the host the account lived on or sometimes even had to provide a manual UUCP routing path.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and other frictionless video-sharing websites didn't exist before 2005. Much of the problem was limited bandwidth of the time and proprietary standards (most "streamed" video was either QuickTime or Real Video formats). Many people did get by with Flash, but that still took minutes to load.
</li></ul></li><li> The very first automobile with a seat belt was the 1948 Tucker Sedan. In the United States, seat belt installation was not mandatory until 1965 and it was not required for drivers to wear them until 1984.
</li><li> Transatlantic telephone calls first became possible when the TAT-1 cable was laid in 1956. For contrast, the first transatlantic telegrams date to 1858 - almost a century earlier - although regular transatlantic telegraphy didn't commence until 1866.
</li><li> Travel writer Bill Bryson noted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australia</a>'s trans-continental Indian Pacific train has an air of 'cultivated venerability' since it was actually begun in 1970. Some classic British and American routes had been <em>dis</em>continued by then.
<ul><li> Darwin, the capital city of the Northern Territory, was only connected to the rest of the country by rail in <em>2003</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The elastic band was patented in the UK in 1845.
</li><li> The very first doorknob was invented in 1878; prior to then, doors were held shut with latches.
</li><li> The first design for barbed wire was drawn up in 1860 in France; the first barbed wire fence actually built was around a cattle pen at an Illinois fair in 1873.
</li><li> Although food has been stored in sealed tin cans since at least 1772, the standard wheeled can opener wasn't invented until 1925. Before then, knives were used.
</li><li> The United States and Canada didn't introduce 911 emergency until 1968 and 1972 respectively. Previously you had to call the local emergency service directly or otherwise call the operator.
</li><li> Shopping carts were first introduced in the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma in 1937, and were patented in 1940.
</li><li> The first commercially-sold typewriter was introduced in 1870.
<ul><li> Until the 1970s, typewriters did not have an exclamation-mark key. To type an exclamation mark, one typed a period, went back a space, and then typed an apostrophe.
</li></ul></li><li> The first automobile brake lights were introduced in 1952.
</li><li> The flyswatter was patented by American businessman Robert R. Montgomery in the year 1900.
</li><li> The very first wheeled suitcase was invented in 1970.
</li><li> Barcodes were introduced in 1974.
</li><li> The first playground slide was built in Washington DC in 1903.
</li><li> For several decades, toasters were luxury items sold mostly to restaurants; they did not become standard kitchen appliances until the 1960s.
</li><li> The first automobile ignition key was produced by Chrysler in 1949; before then, car keys only activated the battery, and a separate button ignited the engine.
</li><li> Velcro was invented in 1941.
</li><li> Regardless of setting, almost every show set before guns will feature gunpowder as an exciting new discovery at some point, often during a trip to ancient China or by introducing a visitor from there. In reality, gunpowder was invented in China in the 9th century (AD) and was introduced to Japan, the Middle East and Europe by the Mongol invasions, in the 13th.
<ul><li> If early gunpowder is depicted as an offensive weapon rather than dust that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">explodes when lit</a>, it will always be a cannon rather than a handheld firearm, and it will fire typical iron cannonballs. In reality, "hand cannons" preceded normal cannons, which arose as a larger version of them, rather than the opposite; and cannons were used to fire large arrows and boulders until iron balls phased them out in the 17th century only.
</li></ul></li><li> The first aerosol cans were manufactured for the US military in 1941, and first sold commercially in 1948.
</li><li> The dumpster was invented in 1936 by Knoxville, Tennessee mayor George Dempster, and was initially a trademarked brand name.
</li><li> Heinz didn't start selling ketchup in plastic bottles (instead of glass) until 2002, and even then, they were initially only for the service industry. This design also features the lid at the <em>bottom</em> of the bottle, rather than the top, and was soon copied by other sauce manufacturers.
</li><li> The first school backpacks went on sale in 1967, and did not become popular until the 1980s. Before then, backpacks were more-or-less only used in scouting and warfare.
</li><li> The classic nautical <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship%27s_wheel">ship's wheel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was invented in the early 18th century; before then, ships were steered with a whipstaff, a big stick that was pushed or pulled to either side.
</li><li> "One-hour photo" services seem hopelessly ancient in the era of ubiquitous smartphone cameras, but they were actually a very late development in the age of film photography; the very first one-hour photo service opened in 1977, and they didn't become the dominant mode for developing photos until the 1990s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a> beams have been around in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> since the 19th century. But the ubiquitous laser wasn't developed until 1960. Although there were already particle accelerators (particle beams going back as early as 1930), death rays were usually said to be made of some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">unobtanium</a>. During the making of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, it was even decided that the signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun">Ray Gun</a> (which would be called a phaser) should not be called a laser since it was only a matter of time before lasers were developed enough to determine what they can and cannot do.
</li><li> Shampoo was a luxury item until the 1970s, before which most people washed their hair with a bar of soap.
</li><li> It may seem like wireless internet has been around forever and that dial-up/cable hookups were things of the 90s, but it actually did not become a standard feature on most laptops until around 2007.
</li><li> Glass mirrors were novelty luxuries for the wealthy until the late 19th century, when efficient and durable methods for silver-coating glass were finally developed. Before then, solid metal mirrors were by far the most common type, usually made of polished steel or bronze.
</li><li> The sand hourglass was invented in the 14th century, right around the same time as the first mechanical clocks.

The UK made a similar switch in 1966.
</li><li> In the UK, electronic appliances generally did not come with their own plugs until a 1992 consumer protection law mandated it. Before then, an appliance's cord would end in frayed wire, which had to be carefully inserted into a plug, which was sold separately.

<ul><li> The Canadian flag dates from 1965. Yes, flags change often, and there have been more recent changes; it's just that it usually takes a big political upheaval like in South Africa or Russia for this to happen. By contrast, the Maple Leaf Flag came out of Prime Minister <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesterBPearson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesterBPearson">Lester B Pearson</a>'s idea to placate growing French Canadian nationalism in the province of Quebec, where also much of his party's base was, with a more distinctively Canadian design and organized a committee to work on the project. The Canadian flag is so familiar it's a surprise to learn how recent it is compared to others (for example the Australian flag is a 1901 design, give or take minor details).
<ul><li> The Canadian flag is able to borrow much of its apparent "tradition" from the fact that it is primarily based on the flag of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Military_College_of_Canada">Royal Military College of Canada (in Kingston)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. As well, the Maple Leaf is a rather old symbol in Canada, used by French Canadians as well as used in the English Canadian poem <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maple_Leaf_Forever">"The Maple Leaf Forever" (both versions)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Put two familiar ideas together, you get a new flag that seems much older and more traditional!
</li><li> This disconnect is so well-known that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> sprang up that the Canadian currency of the '80s had <em>American</em> flags on the Parliament buildings in its art; those are actually the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Red_Ensign">Canadian Red Ensign<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> flag, which was Canada's recognized flag before the Maple Leaf flag became official.
<ul><li> The desire to create a new Canadian flag that didn't have a British symbol like the Red Ensign came out of the Canadian involvement in peacekeeping after the Suez Crisis, in 1956, as the British were among the participants in that conflict and the Canadian peacekeepers did not like being seen as partial to the British side.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the Cornish flag (Saint Piran's Flag) is not recorded as a symbol of Cornwall before 1838.
</li><li> The American flag had 48 stars up to 1959; the 49th and 50th stars weren't added until 1960.
<ul><li> Given that each flag represents a state in the union, this trend will happen again when the United States gains a new state (in fact, a flag with 51 stars has already been approved... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica">now we just need to find the right State.</a> The new flag is traditionally issued on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanHolidays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanHolidays">the 4th of July</a> following the new state's admission into the Union.
</li></ul></li><li> The Union Flag (Jack) of the United Kingdom lacked its red saltire until Ireland and Britain were joined in 1801.
</li><li> East Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea did not have national flags for most of their millennia-long history. It was in the late 1800s that increased exposure to European ships flying flags caused them to think, "Hey, maybe we should make up flags for our countries so that they can't defeat us with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">the cunning use of flags</a>." Moreover, China's current flag was invented by Mao's communist regime in 1949.
<ul><li> Before 1949, the Chinese Communists used a variant of the international communist flag, with a hammer and a sickle on a red field.
</li></ul></li><li> I and J became separate letters in the 16th century.
<ul><li> So did U and V around the same time.
</li><li> And as late as the turn of the 19th to 20th century, I and J were still to some extent treated as variants of one letter. This is the reason why there's no J Street in Washington, DC.
<ul><li> For that matter, W only dates back a few centuries, as well. It was originally represented by using two Vs (which were also Us at the time) in a row, hence its name.
</li><li> W became a separate letter of the Swedish alphabet in 2006.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Although tumbleweed is seen as emblematic of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest">Wild West</a>, it's actually a Eurasian plant (genus <em>Salsola</em>) and wasn't recorded in the U.S. until 1877 &mdash; long after the setting of many westerns.
</li><li> A lot of cities that suffered relatively recent wars have their historic buildings destroyed which were only recently restored. The famed Osaka Castle? Rebuilt in the 70s with concrete after multiple destructions. The bulk of the Gyeongbok Palace complex in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul">Seoul</a> was constructed in the '90s. A more extreme example is the Fraunkirche of Dresden, completely restored in <em>2006</em>.
<ul><li> The Palace of Bavaria in Munich is still undergoing restoration from the damages it sustained in WWII and the expected completion of the restoration is expected to last until 2040! In fact, with the exception of three buildings all of pre-WWII Munich is no longer extant (The Allies used the four tallest buildings as guidance markers for their bombs, so never dropped them there. The fourth was destroyed towards the end of the war when it was struck by a plane.). Thanks to meticulous note taking at Hitler's orders (Hitler ordered the documentation for restoration purposes prior to WWII, figuring that bombing Munich would have very significant symbolic implications, being the place where the Nazi party was born) the allies were able to help restore the city to a nearly identical pre-War look.
</li></ul></li><li> The classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawAWomanInHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawAWomanInHalf">Saw a Woman in Half</a> magic trick performed in the Victorian or Edwardian era, or even earlier? Nope. It was invented in 1921 by one Percy J. Selbit, and when he debuted it at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London, it had a <em>strong</em> element of Grand Guignol, with buckets of fake blood and a very drawn out and realistic spine-sawing effect. It was then figured out, copied and given a more family-friendly presentation by other magicians on the other side of the Atlantic that same year.
</li><li> Children were not exactly encouraged to "read, read, read" until sometime after the advent of television. Of course, before the television (or even the radio) was invented, reading was the primary source of entertainment. Parents generally viewed "excessive reading" to be a much bigger issue than "not reading enough". While "excessive reading" is still a concern for some parents today, it takes a backseat to the issues of "too much television" or "too much video games".
</li><li> The attitude of crying as being "shameful" or "a sign of weakness" actually only became common within the past few centuries. Before that, grieving openly was actually quite common &mdash; and, in fact, was more accepted than it is today. While there is a general attitude today that crying is actually healthy for you, people are still expected to be restrained in expressing their emotions. For examples, people who wail loudly in public today may be thought of as having severe emotional problems &mdash; but, a few centuries ago, that was actually very common.
</li><li> The first children's playground slide was opened to the public on 18 April 1922 (by one Charles Wicksteed in his home town of Kettering, England). While the basic concept was much older (e.g. fairground helter-skelters), these required users to slide on mats, which in turn required an attendant &mdash; Wicksteed's polished slide required only the clothes that the children wore, and could be used unattended (although not usually unsupervised).
</li><li> Depending on which reports you want to believe, the first Pope whose election was signalled by white smoke from the Vatican chimney was either Pius IX (1846) or Benedict XV (1914). Either way, it's not the centuries-old tradition that most people assume it to be.
<ul><li> Even the title 'Pope' itself is newer than people think. The word literally means 'father' &mdash; the title of all Catholic priests, but wasn't reserved for the man we would now consider to <em>the</em> Pope until medieval times.
</li><li> Furthermore, most listed Popes from the Dark Ages or earlier have been retrospectively declared popes, and were not popes in the modern sense. The leadership of the Church was often unclear, and the Bishops of Rome were often challenged by the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch (although Arab conquests of Egypt and Syria made the latter two relatively impotent fairly early). It took centuries of maneuvering and precedent-setting for Rome to be the undisputed seat of leadership of the church. On top of that, many of earliest 'popes' were not even Bishops of Rome as such, just considered by scholars to have been the most important Christians in Rome in the surrounding area in order to give the image of direct descent from Saint Peter.
</li><li> Gregory the First, who began his reign in 590 AD, is generally considered to be the first to hold the full authority of the Papacy.

</li><li> Another issue to consider is that one of the claims to the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome is based upon being the successor of Peter the Apostle, but how does one resolve this in light of that <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter#Road_to_Rome:_Antioch_and_Corinth">Peter was<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Patriarchs_of_Antioch">first Bishop of Antioch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> previous to being the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes#1st_century">first Bishop of Rome<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>?
</li><li> Not to mention, papal infallibility has only been a thing since 1869. And it barely got the required vote.
</li><li> The papacy only started using white and gold in 1808. Prior to that, the papal colors were red and gold.
</li><li> The Fisherman's Ring dates from 1265.
</li><li> Conclaves themselves only date from 1059.
</li><li> The triple tiara dates from the 14th century.
</li></ul></li><li> Two elements ubiquitous in stories set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays">"Arabian Nights" Days</a>, scimitar swords and crescent standards, are surprisingly neither ancient nor Arabian in origin. Scimitars actually originated in Central Asia and were introduced to the Middle East by Turkic peoples centuries after Islam took hold in the region, while the crescent as a symbol of Islam was first used in North Africa in the 14th century (the accompanying star is even newer). If you were to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> to the early period of Islamic expansion or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a>, you'd be surprised to find the Muslim armies using broadswords and waving plain green, white and black banners.
</li><li> The smiley face &#150; two dots and an arc &#150; cannot be proven to have existed before the late 1940s; it was popularized in 1967 by artist George Tenagi, who created it for an ad campaign for the University Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Seattle. In 1970, merchandise with the face started appearing, and it quickly became a phenomenon.
<ul><li> Likewise, the emoticon dates no further back than the late 1940s, where they were used in sci-fi fandoms; they were popularized in 1982 by student Scott Fahlman on the Carnegie Mellon University BBS, from which they spread to the rest of the early internet.
</li></ul></li><li> The "move out when you are an adult" philosophy is a (relatively) recent phenomenon of post WWII America where everyone had four complete years of constant work, savings i.e. rationing, and GI Bill bonuses to boot. Prior to that most people lived in family units and only moved away when there wasn't enough room in the current dwelling.
</li><li> Similarly, people placing their elderly parents in nursing homes. Until relatively recently, aging parents who could no longer care for themselves were usually cared for at home by their adult children. It also doesn't seem to be a common practice outside of the US.
</li><li> Bullfighting was not invented by the Cretans, the ancient Iberians or the Romans. It originated in the Late Middle Ages as a version of jousting in which a mounted lancer (or lancers) faced a bull instead of each other (this is where modern <em><a class="urllink" href="http://platea.pntic.mec.es/dgarciac/c0708/tif1web03/imagenes/Andy%20Cartagena1.jpg">rejoneadores<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></em> and <em><a class="urllink" href="https://livinlavidaespanola.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/picadores201_r2_c2.jpeg">picadores<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></em> come from). Once the bull was left more dead than alive and the lancers had shown their skill, the public was allowed to jump into the arena and kill, butcher and take the bull's meat home (which is why bullfights were &mdash; and are &mdash; performed during holidays; it was never meant to be a contest between man and animal but a form of ritualized slaughter, and for many people it would be the only time they'd get to eat beef, courtesy of those very same lancers, who were aristocratic ranchers).
<ul><li> Typical bullfighters (on foot) arose and started to displace the lancers in the early and mid 18th century. Not coincidentally, this was the same time the new Bourbon dynasty attempted to ban bullfighting repeatedly. This is the reason bullfighters still wear 18th century-looking suits and are called <em>matadors</em>, which means literally "killers". In the beginning they were private challengers, and the ones who faced the less injured bulls before killing them earned more fame and money for themselves. Bullfighting became then less of an aristocratic pastime and more of a way for poor men to become rich celebrities if they did not die in the attempt.
</li><li> Ironically, it was the French invaders in the early 19th century who promoted bullfighting the most, as a cheap attempt to gain popular support by bringing something that the Spanish monarchy had persecuted and banned repeatedly. Once reinstated, the Spanish monarchy made an U-turn and imitated this policy through the 19th century, giving birth to the satyrist moniker <em>"Pan y Toros"</em> ("Bread and Bulls", a pun on the Romans' <em>Panem et Circenses</em>). The Napoleonic armies also introduced bullfighting in southern France, although it only really took off there under the reign of Napoleon III, whose wife was Spanish.
</li><li> The oldest bullrings are from the second half of the 18th century and most weren't built until the 19th or even the early 20th century, when bullfighting was already a tourist attraction. The oldest extant bullring is that of Aranjuez, built 1760. Before they were invented, <em>corridas</em> were done in town squares that were barricaded for the occasion. This is why the Spanish name for a bullring is <em>plaza de toros</em> ("bulls' square").
</li><li> <em>Picadores</em> did not wear protection before the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930), when a law was passed to that effect.
</li></ul></li><li> In Great Britain, celebrating New Year's Day was long seen as a quirky Scottish tradition; in England it was just a normal winter day. Somewhat unexpectedly, it became a public holiday in 1974, and almost immediately the English took to it enthusiastically. It's been suggested that the decision to make it a holiday was due to the energy crisis, since 1 January 1974 happened to be the day that the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Day_Week">Three Day Week<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> went into effect. By having an extra day off, people would use less energy and it might also ease some of the tension happening in the country at the time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romani">Romani</a> people did not begin living in elaborate wagons until the 1850s, and even then, they weren't used outside of Britain. Prior to this, they used tents.
</li><li> US bank Wells Fargo bills itself as being founded in 1852, and its <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/dVfX/wells-fargo-earning-back-your-trust-song-by-black-keys">brand identity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> frequently calls back to its roots of stagecoaches traversing the American West loaded with gold. While this isn't <em>exactly</em> false, inasmuch as there really was a Wells Fargo company founded in 1852 that started as a delivery and financial services firm on the West Coast<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35ea83');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note35ea83" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35ea83');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Founded, incidentally, by two of the three original people who established American Express on the East Coast after the third partner objected to expanding AmEx's operations to San Francisco</span> that later turned into a bank, its relationship to the current bank is more complex. The company that currently exists as Wells Fargo was actually founded as the Norwest Corporation in 1929 in Minnesota; in 1998 it bought out the original Wells Fargo&mdash;at the time a regional bank in California&mdash;to establish a West Coast presence. Norwest then decided to take on the Wells Fargo name to acquire a catchier name and backstory (though they did lean into this a little further by moving their HQ to San Francisco).
</li><li> Fan conventions for most cult genres such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBooks">Comic Books</a>, Fantasy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a>, only go back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> at the earliest. Prior to that, most gatherings that may have called themselves comic book or sci-fi conventions were primarily networking events attended mostly by professionals in the business such as writers or artists. Even the concept of "dealers rooms" or vendors merchandise alleys hadn't been born yet as at the time, there were very few wares to sell. And there were no cosplay or celebrity appearances/autograph sessions. The tone of these events was very much like a typical business convention/symposium with seminars, workshops, and lectures, many of which occurred in individuals' hotel rooms with a half dozen participants, instead of huge auditoriums with audiences of hundreds. They were very low key events that lacked any of the fanfare and hype of San Diego or New York Comicon or Atlanta's Dragoncon. In fact in these early years, such conventions may have occurred in hotels without any of the the non-convention guests even noticing. Non pros were not unwelcome but they might have found those early cons dry and boring, the average attendees being somewhere over 40, White, and 98% male. There was little to no mention of multimedia sci-fi (TV shows and films), the central focus being literary science fiction and their authors, with many authors being snobbishly dismissive of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> and any other then existing genre multimedia. Typical "non-pro" fans attending these early conventions were very "hardcore" enthusiasts who may or may not have been aspiring professional writers.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36xhl9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note36xhl9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36xhl9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It could be argued that there were very few "casual" SF fans in the era prior to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, since literary SF was more prevalent than multimedia SF; The pickings were limited to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek TOS reruns</a></em>, a handful of critically acclaimed films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and mostly little remembered, short lived, low budget TV series of varying quailty (and mostly aimed towards younger audiences anyway)</span> Science Fiction conventions originally served as gatherings for peer to peer networking, collaboration, and professional development, not an outlet for fans to fly their freak flags. Also, "comic book" and "science fiction" conventions usually were separate entities in the days before dealers rooms. The change would not really come full circle until the mid to late 1990s when these events would be marketed as "festivals" instead of "conventions" and aiming to attract casual fans of all ages (and genders) in masses while more hardcore fans and professionals networked behind the scenes.
</li><li> Showering daily did not become the norm until the 1940s. Prior to this, bathing was a luxury that most people afforded themselves once or twice a week, while daily ablutions would be done at the bathroom sink.
</li><li> While color TVs were no longer a luxury by the late 1970s, black and white TVs were still being manufactured and sold into the early &#145;90s.
</li><li> The whole concept of Heaven and Hell being in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a> is far more recent than most people think. Most ancient people thought Heaven literally <em>was</em> in the sky/space (Hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">Fluffy Cloud Heaven</a> trope) and Hell being underground (or possibly at the center of the Earth). Even some religious literature as late as the 19th century depicts this, the whole idea of Heaven and Hell being other dimensions didn't really catch on until the 20th century, when people started being able to actually explore the sky, and later space, thanks to various technological advances.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flokati_rug">Flokati rug<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck">Press Your Luck</a></em> fame (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">Undesirable Prize</a>), was invented c. 1967.
</li><li> The whole idea of the nuclear family (i.e. a mom, dad, and some kids) that many self-proclaimed "traditionalists" champion is actually only a few centuries old. A real "traditional family" would be a medieval style family, where the entire extended family lives together either on a farm or in a castle, depending on if they're peasants or royalty.
</li><li> While the United States Postal Service has had its roots reach as far back as 1775, the independent government agency as we know it today was only formed in 1971.
