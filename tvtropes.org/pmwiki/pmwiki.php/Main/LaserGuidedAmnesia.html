Amnesia is a funny thing in the real world and can give you lots of strange symptoms.
</p><p>In TV, it's very weird too, but it's much more specific. Amnesia has several basic attributes in TV land:
</p><p></p><ol><li> With surgical precision, amnesia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia">strips you of all information pertaining to personal identity</a>, leaving just about everything else intact. TV Amnesia is a disorder where you forget where you put your keys, but you do <em>not</em> forget what a key <em>is</em> or what it's <em>for</em>. You will forget where you went to school, but not any of the things you <em>learned</em> in school. As a result, the character will retain all of their skills &#151; though they may not <em>know</em> they have them at first. <br>Interestingly, while this would seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience">Hollywood Science</a> at first glance, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">really is how retrograde amnesia works</a> (well, some of the time). "Procedural memory", which governs skills that the brain has automated, appears to be separate from "declarative memory", where you store previous facts and events, and in many cases only one of the two is damaged. And then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory">muscle memory,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which may or may not be affected by amnesia.
</li><li> In a series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a>, amnesia typically also erases all knowledge of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>. The character will completely forget that aliens, monsters, vampires and such are real, but will remember that normal people don't believe in such things. This can seem especially odd since, if you don't remember anything, how do you know that aliens and werewolves are any stranger than the sun coming up in the morning and setting at night?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02fzu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note02fzu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02fzu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Probably not so odd after all: if you started to believe in those things only after having encountered them yourself (which is almost always the case &#151; otherwise why bother to wipe your memory at all?), you might revert to your original belief once you can't remember the encounter. And even if you can't remember what "normal people believe in", one can bet they'll remind you of it very quickly once the subject is brought up in conversation &#151; and now you have nothing to retort with.</span> Even more odd if the character is himself an alien or supernatural being and subsequently "defaults to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a>" after losing his memory, which is typically the case for those with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia">Alternate Identity Amnesia</a>. Occasionally, this is paired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> to create an elaborate deception.
</li><li> With very few exceptions, amnesia is always entirely retrograde: memory loss extends backward from the moment of injury. Anterograde amnesia (the inability to accumulate new memories) has only started to come up in recent years, usually in comedies. Amnesia usually extends back clean to birth. Real amnesia resulting from head trauma or drugs is usually confined to a short period on <em>both sides</em> (before and after) of the incident.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1tnn4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1tnn4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1tnn4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One exception to this is the horror game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlightDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlightDream">Blight Dream</a></em>, which deals entirely with anterograde amnesia in a serious manner.</span>
</li><li> If a tool of the group the protagonists belong to, the likelihood of abuse of this power is almost never addressed. There's little interest, procedure, or advocacy devoted to making sure someone isn't stealing from, raping, killing or committing other crimes against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> and then erasing their memory of it. After all, who cares about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> as long as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> is intact?
</li><li> The amnesia inducer works like a toggle switch (especially in the case of blunt force to the cranium). (Surgeon General's Warning: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Definitely NOT Truth in Television.</a>)

To this end, it's pretty standard for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack">The Men in Black</a> to use this on anyone who's seen too much, often employing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryWipingCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemoryWipingCrew">Memory-Wiping Crew</a>.

<ul><li> At the end of the first season of the 90s anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Usagi mentally wishes to have a normal life, she and the other Inner Sailor Senshi get resurrected, but end up losing their memories of not only being Sailor Senshi, but also of being friends with each other. Luna does not even fix this until the second season, when the Makaiju Aliens cause trouble in Tokyo.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>, this is played straight for many of the characters. Gil wishes to know who his master really is, Alice wants to regain her memories of her life before she became a chain, and Oz wants to discover the truth behind his sin. The results are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">very</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">very</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">disturbing.</a> Where shall we begin?
<ul><li> Ah, the heroine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Alice the Bloody Black Rabbit</a>, a rough girl who used to be a human until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her best friend, a stuffed rabbit named Oz, came to life and was used as a tool of destruction against his will. She killed herself to end his suffering and then her soul took over his body, stealing his power, wiping her memories and her sister's in the process.</span>
</li><li> Gilbert, Oz's little servant who used to be Jack's servant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually, he was Glen's servant, and he acquired amnesia via being STABBED in the back by Jack. Oz is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> whose true form is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject">Animate Inanimate Object</a>; a stuffed plush rabbit that came to life and wound up in his contractor's body that was deaging and believed himself to be human. He lost all his memories of being B-rabbit somehow-the manga hasn't explained that yet.</span>
</li><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elliot lost his memories of killing his own family with Humpty Dumpty's help.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Masane Amaha in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchBlade">Witch Blade</a></em> plays this straight with #3 (classic trauma induced amnesia), but this is subverted later when she never gets her memories back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/StrawberryPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/StrawberryPanic">Strawberry Panic!</a></em>: Amane falls from her horse and forgets that she was going to enter the Etoile election, and her relationship with Hikari. She remembers having been <em>asked</em> to enter, and the rest of the details of her life. (This is surprisingly similar to the post trauma memory loss that is <em>actually</em> but <em>rarely</em> incurred by some people.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>, a major part of the original plot is that <em>everyone</em> in Paradigm City &mdash; and apparently whatever is left of the world, as well &mdash; has amnesia of unknown origin. Unable to recall who they were before the incident (but still retaining most of their day-to-day survival skills), everyone begins life anew. Then odd and disturbing reminders start appearing, many years later... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The finale implies that they're all characters in an anime series.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWindNamedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWindNamedAmnesia">A Wind Named Amnesia</a></em> deals with the whole world suffering from sudden amnesia and not a pretty type: people were turned down to almost animal behaviour while only the main protagonist was restored to humanity by psionics and training.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has a similar memory erasing plot device, with the downside that the blank is generally filled in by something random from the person's imagination. It has fun with what the blanks are filled with, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">particularly strange</a> character who "remembers" that the reason there is a hole in the classroom and a missing student is because an army of monkeys burst into class and dragged him away.
<ul><li> They later gain an upgraded version without that particular problem, but by this time half the cast has some level of spirit power, and thus the memory modification fails to one degree or another on them.
<ul><li> The third movie has villains that can perform a different method that erases entire characters from others' memories. It's surprisingly thorough to the point where a character who trained like mad to get strong enough to save an erased character forgets his training and thinks he's much weaker than he actually is. It can't erase physical evidence, however, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> Urahara immediately notices discrepancies in his notes and memory and figures something's up. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s powers are so intrinsically tied to having met the erased character that it doesn't work right on him.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Kaito of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> presumably gets a bump on the head that causes him to selectively forget everything about Lucia and mermaids. Of course, this turns out to be an evil plot (and a rather lucky one for Michel at that&mdash; he gets the energy from Kaito's memories <em>and</em> blackmail to try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">convert</a> Lucia to his side).
</li><li> Happens to a lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon">Kanon</a></em> characters, all for reasons relating to the town's miracles and the tragedy seven years ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, the Mannish Boy's Stand, Death 13, can trap people in a dream world and kill them in their sleep. If the victim manages to wake up in the real world, however, they wouldn't have any recollection of what they experienced until they're back in the dream world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em>: Rohan can use Heaven's Door to write inscriptions into people to make them do or forget whatever he wants them to.
</li><li> Diavolo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">Vento Aureo</a></em> can erase time with his Stand, King Crimson. If anyone within the vicinity is affected, they forget whatever action they were doing in the time that was erased.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma &frac12;</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shampoo uses a technique on Akane to erase all memories of Ranma. She remembers every other person and thing, even when not knowing Ranma means she wouldn't know how she became familiar with them. Apparently, Ranma's father is living with her for no discernible reason. Shampoo's amnesia technique has the added benefit of preventing the victim from ever relearning the suppressed memory, so every time Ranma was re-introduced to Akane she'd forget the latest introduction as soon as he left her line of sight.
</li><li> After accidentally smacking his head with a watermelon in a training accident, Kun&#333; retains the formidable skills he gained through his watermelon training, but forgets his name, his pompous demeanor, and how much money he owes to Nabiki (none, but she's not going to say that).

Their secret distillery is semi-illegal, and Yumina is a priestess, so she conveniently forgets about the whole thing. Somewhat justified since alcohol can have this effect, but it's awfully weird that she doesn't notice having no memories of the previous night, and she doesn't even get a hangover to go with the blackout.

She encounters an alien lifeform which absorbs all over evil traits, leaving her to wander the beachside as a kindly young woman as Rumiya and Pixy Misa try to find her - both Tsunami and Sasami have no idea what's going on as Tsunami <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">thinks that Ramia is there... which is a doll in front of her.</a> She quickly remembers everything, though, when she finds Pixy Misa and Pretty Sammy fighting the creature.

This gave Scrooge the specific amnesia of forgetting everything that happened since last November. Tapping again apparently is a complete cure.
</li><li> In the Paperinik (Donald's superhero alter ego) stories, Paperinik has candies that wipe memories, normally slipped to people who have somehow found out Paperinik's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> (notably, the first known victim is the candies' own inventor Gyro, who <em>took them willingly</em> upon being told by Donald.

A man wakes up with no memories of his identity, but has lingering emotional resonance with certain people and places. How much of his personality is truly his remains a mystery &mdash; it's implied that his love for his wife is genuine, but at the same time, he's also driven to visit Shell Beach, a place everyone's visited but nobody can describe its location. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It doesn't exist, until the end when he makes it exist.

The explanation of the process is mainly technobabble, but is believable and internally consistent, with some noticeable secondary memory loss.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForgotten">The Forgotten</a></em> revolves around the protagonist realizing that no one remembers that her missing son even existed (even her husband), except for her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, she discovers that it's all a part of an alien experiment to test parental connection to their children. She's the outlier, who retains her memories, even when the alien manages to forcibly rip the memories of her son's life from her. Luckily, she still remembers being pregnant, causing the memories to come back. The alien is punished by his superiors for his failure, and her son is brought back, along with the other kids.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JupiterAscending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JupiterAscending">Jupiter Ascending</a></em>, the space police and bounty hunters come standardly equipped with the ability to make people on the worlds they're visiting forget any of the things they see that are out of the ordinary, including inducing laser-guided amnesia and building back structures that were damaged in combat that the visitors were involved in. However, the fact that people that may have been killed during the fight wasn't brought up.
</li><li> Invoked in the Korean <em>Lost and Found</em>. After a car accident reunites her with her high school crush, the protagonist pretends to have amnesia so that he'll have to take of her. Her doctor lampshades it, saying she seems to have gotten "TV amnesia" that wiped her memory but left all her other skills intact.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Paycheck">Paycheck</a></em> film features literally Laser Guided Amnesia (neurons destroyed with lasers), as a method to prevent engineers to trade out top secret technology after finishing their assignment.
<ul><li> It also appears to work flawlessly, but can only be used for erasing short periods of time (up to a few weeks). For longer periods, they switch to a chemical agent which is supposed to do the same job. It doesn't work quite as well, leaving behind pieces of memories.
</li><li> In the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a> short story, this is basically what motivates the protagonist to have to seek out the company that hired him and a find a way back in, since the memories are literally <em>burned</em> meaning there's no way to co-operate with the police (who know he's been up to something illegal) and thus avoid prosecution.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2009 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push">Push</a></em>, there exist people called Wipers, who can temporarily or permanently erase memories, useful as there are other people in that universe who can read minds and memories. Wipers can wipe all memory up to a certain point, or try to wipe only certain memories relating to specific topic, but the accuracy of the wipe is determined by their skill. Pushers can do the opposite and convince someone that a specific event really happened, when it really didn't (then again, this is just a more effective means of something humans can already do perfectly well, since memory is a very pliable thing). They can also convince someone that something <em>didn't</em> happen, making them think that the real memory was imagined.

The government of T&iacute;r Tairngire cultivates a fruit called la&eacute;sal, which can be processed into la&eacute;s, a drug that can erase up to twelve hours of memory upon consumption and that erasure is complete; it actually "formats" the physical storage of short-term memory in the brain. Le&auml;l is a street drug derivative commonly used as a date-rape drug that removes up to two hours of memory. Cutting cocaine with le&auml;l creates "pixie dust."

</li><li> Holy slayers (assassins) in <em>Al-Qadim</em> sometimes use a "Blade of Forgetfulness": everyone seeing it swung in a certain pattern suffers a complete memory lapse regarding everything that just happened and is about to happen (up to 3 rounds before and after).

As soon as anyone walks out of the room containing SCP-055 they forget any facts about it; same goes for looking away from a photo of it. No one can even remember that they're in possession of an amnesia inducing entity: Foundation personnel will frequently come across the SCP-055 database entry, freak out about the fact that there's an unknown entity <em>right inside their base</em>, and then promptly forget about it.

SCP-3000 is a gigantic moray eel that rarely moves, and simply looking at it can slowly erode someone's memories. Upon devouring a human being, it secretes a compound that the Foundation uses to make amnestics, so they exploit it by deliberately feeding it D-Class personnel - something heavily objected to by the Ethics Committee, but ultimately the Foundation relies too much on the amnesiacs to stop doing it.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TronUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TronUprising">TRON: Uprising</a></em>, it's established that any program who loses their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingsOfDeath">Identity</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDisc">Disc</a> starts having a glitch in the form of temporary bouts of memory loss, and eventually becomes a 'stray' - unable to hold any long-term or short-term memories, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">unable to have a notion of 'self'</a>.

<ul><li> Studies of a drug called U0126 suggest that it might actually be able to induce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a>: see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070305/full/070305-17.html">http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070305/full/070305-17.html<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> A common side-effect of the so-called "rape drug" sedatives Rohypnol and GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) is retrograde amnesia, covering the time span the victim was under the drug and usually a short while previous to ingesting it.
<ul><li> Likewise, imbibing heroic amounts of alcohol can induce retrograde amnesia &mdash; GHB shares many of the biochemical processes, but is far [more?] rapid in effect, which is why it's such an insidious thing to spike a drink with.
</li><li> All benzodiazepines (i.e. drugs in the Valium family, of which Rohypnol is one) can potentially cause retrograde amnesia, but some more than others. Doctors and dentists sometimes deliberately choose Ativan (lorazepam) for its strong tendency in this direction, which makes it ideal for sedating patients prior to unpleasant procedures. Some things you'd be thankful not to recall in great detail.
</li><li> Ketamine, an anesthetic drug used in veterinary medicine, causes amnesia from onset to awakening. This makes it very useful for use in animals (it's hard to treat an animal who has a subconcious aversion towards you after they've been under), but also makes it <em>very</em> illegal to handle without supervision of a licensed veterinarian.
</li></ul></li><li> Many severe accident victims lose memory of the accident as a result of the trauma. Memories don't quite form instantly, so if something happens to interrupt your brain's function (such as your head slamming into the pavement) the memory of the event will never have a chance to form in the first place.
</li><li> And of course the whole repressed memory thing, where the mind blocks out painful memories so we're only disturbed on the subconscious level. Though the nature of this and even whether or not it exists is controversial. <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.brown.edu/recoveredmemory/about/">The serious research is being done here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> There was once an English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">footballer</a> named Mills who spent the night in his rival player's house after getting hit on the head. He very specifically couldn't remember the events of the match in which the accident happened...or what team he played for. Everything else was absolutely fine. Fortunately, this didn't last long.
<ul><li> Daniel Agger of Liverpool got a nasty concussion during a match against Arsenal. He said he doesn't remember the match at all.
</li><li> Same with the time when John Terry was knocked out after being kicked in the head against Arsenal (who seem to have a thing about causing head injuries) a couple of seasons back, he apparently couldn't remember anything that happened after coming out the tunnel for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GEB-TYLMmQ">the second half.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cujo">Cujo</a></em> during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">drinking days</a>. He vaguely remembers writing the book, but only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> of the process. He can't remember the specifics or how he came up with what he feels were the best parts of the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a></em> once had an amnesia story where a man shows up in a town with absolutely no memory of his past or identity. A man gives him a job, and a customer came in and realized that he was operating an old-style adding machine so efficiently that he must have worked on them professionally in the past, which they used as a first step in figuring out his identity.
</li><li> A woman who had an accident and lost several years of memory, including that of her husband, was the inspiration for the film <em>The Vow</em>.
</li><li> Due to being high as a kite while doing it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarrieFisher">Carrie Fisher</a> had no memory of taking part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em>. Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> claimed the same during his interview with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> and appeared to be completely baffled when shown a clip of the special.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s cocaine addiction was so bad during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> that he retained little to no memory of recording his album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StationToStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StationToStation">Station to Station</a></em>.
</li><li> In a darker example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> does not remember the second half of his (in)famous Hell in A Cell match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> due to the injuries suffered in that match.
</li><li> Epileptics can sometimes remember up to the very moment the seizure begins, then have a blank during the seizure and for several minutes after. For example, they may not remember such acts as standing up from being trapped in a corner, or even painful actions such as having a nail snapped back into place. Sometimes the only reason an epileptic knows they have had a seizure may be because of these suspicious blanks in their memories.
</li><li> Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">Implausible Deniability</a> at a number of American congressional hearings. Refusing to answer or being caught lying can have serious consequences, but it's more difficult to prove someone doesn't remember something. Consequently a number of to-remain-nameless officials over the years have gone before congress and the nation and mysteriously forgotten what should be quite memorable actions, people they've met, things they've talked about, and policies of their own department. In some instances these performances would, if taken at face value, raise serious concerns about the mental competence of the individuals in question.
</li><li> For the most part, this trope occurring due to psychological trauma is NOT <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, unless said trauma was accompanied by a head injury. Indeed, people with PTSD and the like usually suffer just the opposite problem: being completely unable to ever forget the horrible things that happened to them.
