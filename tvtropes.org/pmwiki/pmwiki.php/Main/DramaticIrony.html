Dramatic Irony, or Suspense as it is also known, turns that on its head, letting the audience see the whole picture when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>, or even the entire cast, is kept largely in the dark. You, the viewer, are actually ahead of the characters.
</p><p>Fat lot of good it does us though. When dramatic irony crops up, it's usually not to let us feel smugly superior; instead it's to toy with our fragile little emotions. If we're lucky, the emotion being manipulated will be amusement. In serious situations, dramatic irony will be present to make us squirm and bite our fingernails in anxiety, since we can see the danger coming but cannot communicate this knowledge to the characters in order to save them.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>To really fit the definition though, one of the characters must make a statement, or perform an action, to fully illustrate that they are unaware of the situation. To the character, what they're saying or doing is perfectly sensible based on the knowledge they have. To the audience though, the statement or action is ludicrous or dangerously uninformed.
</p><p><span class="asscaps">There are three main uses of Dramatic Irony (quite apart from the unintentional result of making things more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler">Spoiler</a>proof):</span>
</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>To create tension</em>: Hank has left a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb">Time Bomb</a> under a restaurant table that will go off late that evening. The audience saw him leave it there, but none of the characters have noticed. Bob and Joe are dining at that table that very evening. If they finish early they will live, but if they take a dessert it could be their last one ever. This ramps up the suspense because the audience must wait to find out if Bob and Joe will die in the explosion or not.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <em>To make the audience cringe on the character's behalf</em>: Alice did really well in the audition for the school play, clearly outclassing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> rival. But unknown to her, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>'s mother is in charge of casting. Alice runs up to her nemesis to gloat... Meanwhile, the viewers are cringing uncomfortably, because they know that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> is about to laugh in Alice's face and get the part that Alice deserved.
</li><li> <em>For comedy</em>: Popular in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Farce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Farce">farces</a>, especially those involving twins where no-one can remember who's who or in comedies where someone's cross-dressing. For example, Bob's girlfriend has just dumped him. He complains about the fickleness of women to his new best friend Adrian, remarking that they, as men, are much more sensible, and that he can rely more on Adrian than he can any woman. Bob is unaware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Adrian is really Alice in disguise</a>. The audience, on the other hand, know Adrian's real identity, and so Bob's comment seems ironic.
</li></ul><p>This trope is a staple of theatre, thanks largely in part to the mechanics of that particular medium. Characters move on and off stage, but the audience stays in place. They're the only ones who stick around long enough to hear the "whole story". In the theatre, however, there's usually one other party who knows what's going on, especially if it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy">Tragedy</a> &#151; and that is the villain.
</p><p>Classic theatre usually favours tense or comedic use of dramatic irony. Modern media is more likely to employ the "cringe factor" variation, which walks the line between tragedy and comedy.
</p><p>A character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> are often a source of Dramatic Irony.

</li><li> As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> is Julius Caesar, this is indulged in frequently with the comic's portrayal of Brutus. Since the comedy in <em>Asterix</em> is mostly very light-hearted and stabbing your best friend to death doesn't fit that, it's played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a>, with Brutus being never shown without a dagger, which he constantly fiddles with and occasionally injures himself with. Caesar will frequently go on to explain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">just how much he values Brutus as his most trusted friend and confidante</a> (although he's shown with significantly high intelligence and judgement other than with Brutus). Brutus is so much all about this that he's almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingProp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingProp">Living Prop</a> for much of the comics, before suddenly and gloriously emerging in <em>Asterix and Son</em> to succeed in destroying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage">Undefeatable Little Village</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>, Cammie, bitter about being shipped off from Astro City to spend the summer in the countryside with relatives, resentfully thinks that they would not think so highly of their local superhero Roustabout if they could compare him to a real Astro City superhero &mdash; like <em>Crackerjack</em>, who not only (unlike Roustabout) has no superpowers but also is an arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> (also unlike Roustabout).
<ul><li> Similarly, when Brian longs to be a hero for the respect, he sees Crackerjack in action and thinks he gets respect in spades &mdash; unaware that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> ways mean he gets less than even his exploits would merit in the abstract.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Atlantis Chronicles</em> get a lots of mileage out of the fact that the text-boxes are directly from the Atlantis Chronicles, but the events on-panel are what actually happened. This is generally played for laughs, but it turns horrific at the end of one volume, where the chronicler notes that the princess was reportedly frigid on her wedding night, and chalks it up to nerves (it being her first time and all). The reader, however, knows that she had been raped the previous night.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanCurseOfTheWhiteKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanCurseOfTheWhiteKnight">Batman: Curse of the White Knight</a></em>, the Joker could not help but note the irony that his children were born in the crypt where Laffy was buried, the place where his persona (and by extension, the legendary history between him and Batman) was born.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Concrete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Concrete">Concrete</a>: The Human Dilemma</em>: Concrete is hired to be a spokesperson for a radical and controversial population control program on the basis that he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "sterile, race-neutral, and childless."</span> It was established back in <em>An Armchair Stuffed With Dynamite</em> that people can tell that Concrete wasn't <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> formerly of their race, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">somehow</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">becomes pregnant</a> literally the night before accepting the job, thus negating the other two reasons he was hired as well.</span>
<ul><li> Maureen suggests drilling into the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> swelling on his back</span>. Only the audience know it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his offspring</span>, and for a few tense panels are left to worry about its fate.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DownTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DownTown">Down Town</a></em>, Harry thinks about how glad he is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Molly</span> can't read his mind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">Yeah, about that...</a>
</li><li> Basically any time a superhero keeps a secret identity, it will lead to this trope. Think of all the instances where someone judged Peter Parker for not being around when a supervillain attacked, not knowing he <em>was</em> present as the Amazing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, the times people misconstrued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a>'s true identities, or the many times where someone badmouthed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> and said he was just a hired bodyguard, not realizing they were talking to the CEO of Stark Enterprises under the mask.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HalJordanAndTheGreenLanternCorps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HalJordanAndTheGreenLanternCorps">Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps</a></em> has the next example: In the "Prism of Time" arc Kyle suggests he and Soranik watch Terminator because the of the time travel in the arc. The Big Bad of the arc, Sarko, is the child of Kyle and Soranik from the future, not unlike the time tangled Conner family of the Terminator franchise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>: In the "Origins" prequel special, we're shown young clone brothers Joseph and Rico Dredd as trainee Judges. During one of their assignments they hang back for a brief moment, promising each other that they'll always stay together no matter what. It's already established in the comic's chronology that Rico will eventually turn evil and die by Joe's hands.
</li><li> Triumph of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a> Task Force</em> was involved in a positively brutal incident of dramatic irony. After his life falls apart, Triumph considers consummating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> to get the years of his life he lost back. Instead of signing a contract or anything like that, all Triumph has to do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UnderworldUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UnderworldUnleashed">light a specific candle</a> the devil had given him. Despite the fact that Triumph had been kind of a dick lately (or, you know, always), Ray and Gypsy show up in the nick of time to tell him how important he is to them, not knowing about the candle.

Darryl &mdash; who has fallen in love with Alex by this point &mdash; thinks to himself that the irony of this is sharp enough to cut him to ribbons.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Holes">Holes</a></em> has several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashbacks</a> that reveal information that the protagonist, Stanley, does not know:

<ul><li> In the first book, Honor is pursuing a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Havenite Q-ship</span> she believes is trying to summon an invasion force. They're actually trying to <em>call off</em> the invasion. Unfortunately, she doesn't know this, and given that she didn't, letting the ship get away would have been gross dereliction of duty.
<ul><li> The dramatic irony is noted in-story as the enemy captain himself states that he can't tell her he's trying to stop the attack and prevent a war because it would be admitting that there was a planned attack which would be evidence Haven was behind everything that was going on, and therefore likely lead to a war. He also admits that even were he to tell her, she wouldn't have any reason to believe him and let him go.

Frollo's men want to take her and kill her; the gypsies want to free her. Quasimodo, unfortunately, has their roles exactly backwards in his head, so he's busy "protecting" his beloved Esmeralda by <em>helping</em> the bad guys and <em>hindering</em> the good guys.

</li><li> In Jason Matthews's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedSparrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedSparrow">Red Sparrow</a></em>, the majority of the story is about the CIA protecting their penetration of the SVR, and the Russians attempting to unmask the traitor among them. The novel starts by introducing the mole and the American case officer handling him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Renegades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Renegades">Renegades</a></em> uses this both for building tension and making the reader cringe, as Nova - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleAgent">Double Agent</a> who's really the villain Nightmare - is often told that her actions as a hero make her a role model for the younger Renegades.

</li><li> A major plot device throughout William Golding's novel, <em>Rites of Passage</em>. Said novel features passages from Reverend Colley's diary, who believes that he has made a great friend out of Talbot and the crewmen. In reality, we are made aware from the beginning that Talbot can't stand him. Furthermore, it is fairly obvious to the readers that Colley is a closet homosexual, yet poor Colley lacks the self-awareness to realise this before it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">gets him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">into serious trouble</a>.

<ul><li> After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> incident, Koutarou becomes the legendary figure known as the Blue Knight. Very few people know about this, but they frequently refer to the Blue Knight in front of or otherwise in connection to Koutarou. In a somewhat unusual example, Koutarou himself is unaware of being the Blue Knight, thinking that the Blue Knight is some other person and that he (Koutarou) merely did everything that should have been done by the Blue Knight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His secret is revealed at the end of Volume 13</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, many characters invoke the Goddess of Dawn, an important religious figure. Said Goddess has a very deep connection to the main cast: among other things, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was partly responsible for the above time travel incident and if any two or more of the girls perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a>, the result is the Goddess of Dawn</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lemony Snicket explicitly mentions this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a> Book the Second</em>: "The Reptile Room" before Uncle Monty's death when he tells us Uncle Monty's going to die and then goes on to tell us about dramatic irony and how terrible it feels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSisterVerseAndTheTalonsOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSisterVerseAndTheTalonsOfRuin">The Sister Verse and the Talons of Ruin</a></em> uses this often. Early in the first act, the protagonist visits an address in search of a killer. The killer, revealed to the audience in a previous scene, answers the door, and impersonates the owner of the home while the real owner is tied up in the basement.
</li><li> George R. R. Martin uses dramatic irony a fair amount in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>.
<ul><li> One notable example occurs in book two, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClashOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClashOfKings">A Clash of Kings</a></em>, when Arya Stark, in the guise of Nan, Roose Bolton's cupbearer, tells Elmar Frey that she hopes that the princess to whom he is betrothed will die. Of course, she herself <em>is</em> the princess in question.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords">A Storm of Swords</a></em>, after intervening at the Wall, King Stannis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">offers to legitimize</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Jon Snow</a>, allowing him to inherit Winterfell, since Stannis needs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Stark in Winterfell</a> in order to win the loyalty of the North. Jon refuses, not knowing that his half-brother Robb, the lord of Winterfell, named Jon as his heir <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shortly before his death</span>, since all his full siblings were either presumed dead, or in Lannister custody.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords">A Storm of Swords</a></em> has a more lighthearted example with the woman who tries to seduce Gendry claiming to be a bastard of Robert Baratheon. Arya notes that her hair is the same color as the late king's, but that lots of people, including Gendry, have black hair, so it means nothing. It's ironic on several levels, because Gendry himself is unknowingly a bastard of Robert's.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first chapters of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFeastForCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFeastForCrows">A Feast for Crows</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADanceWithDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADanceWithDragons">A Dance with Dragons</a></em>, several characters make decisions and assumptions based on the belief <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tywin Lannister</span> is alive and in charge. Readers already know from the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStormOfSwords">A Storm of Swords</a></em> that that is not the case. Justified, in that news of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tywin</span>'s death would realistically take time to reach the parts of Westeros further from King's Landing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ANewDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ANewDawn">A New Dawn</a></em> has two notable cases of this. First off, the novel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Count Vidian, is stated early on in the book to have never believed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientCosmicForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientCosmicForce">the Force</a>. Vidian is constantly attempting to gain the favour of the Emperor, who, lest we forget, is a Sith Lord and powerful Force-user. There are also two occasions where one of the protagonists, Jedi fugitive Kanan, nearly uses the Force on Vidian. Second, the main plot of the novel concerns the threat of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the blowing up of a moon</span>. Kanan and Hera find it incredibly difficult to believe that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's possible to blow up a moon at all</span>, as is Imperial officer Captain Sloane. Fans of the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, however, know that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blowing up moons, or even planets, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">all too possible</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsMasterAndApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsMasterAndApprentice">Master and Apprentice</a></em>: Qui-Gon notes that Rael Averross was, at the age of 5, the oldest child admitted into the Jedi Order that he knows of, and he thinks to himself that there is no way the Order will ever take in anyone that old again, let alone older. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">Really...</a></em>
</li></ul></li><li> In the book series <em>The Sword, the Ring and the Chalice</em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleFugitive">Noble Fugitive</a> Alexeika first meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">Prince Dain</a>, she initially presumes he's a spoiled, pampered brat as he was living in the prosperous country of Mandria while she and the rest of the people suffered under the cruel rule of Dain's uncle. What she doesn't know is that Dain's sister and adoptive family were killed and he suffered through starvation, beatings and discrimination and only very recently learned of his heritage. If not for certain circumstances, he would have remained a beggar. His friend Thrum coolly points this out to her when she makes such accusations towards Dain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fifth book, <em>Victory of Eagles</em>, begins with Temeraire banished to a breeding ground in Wales and Lawrence imprisoned in the brig of a warship in the English Channel off Dover. Temeraire bribes a Winchester to check the gossip chain among couriers and confirm Lawrence's survival, is informed that the ship he was on sank when France launched a successful cross-channel invasion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">has a near breakdown</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">resolves to take the battle to the invaders</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">organizes the inmates of the breeding ground into a militia</a>, drafts the human herders/minders there for a logistics train, and heads for the fighting. Meanwhile Lawrence makes it to the lifeboats (his cell having been opened by a stray cannonball), is briefly jailed in Dover before Admiral Roland has him brought to the main forces south of London and convinces the high command that Temeraire is needed on the front lines badly enough to send Lawrence to get him, and is shuttled to the breeding ground... to find it abandoned by human and dragon alike mere hours before.
</li><li> This trope comes heavily into play in the eighth book, <em>Blood of Tyrants</em>. For the entire first part and almost until the end of the second, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain Will Laurence has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">forgotten the past 8 years of his life</a> after getting swept off the dragon transport en route to China. This means he doesn't remember his time as an aviator in the British Aerial Corps, nor that he has a powerful bond with his dragon, Temeraire, or that even Temeraire exists. He still thinks he's the captain of the <em>Reliant</em> (and by extension not knowing that his best friend and former first lieutenant, Tom Riley, is dead). As Japan has closed its borders off to any foreigners, save for the trading port of Nagasaki, Laurence's presence in Japan is suspect, and the fact that he speaks perfect Chinese makes the authorities think he is a spy for China. Laurence denies this, of course lacking the memory that Britain essentially <em>does</em> have an alliance with China, just in a sort of unofficial way: in book 2, Laurence was adopted by the Emperor and became a prince of China.</span> Definitely done for the tension, but in the second part <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Laurence is back with his fellow aviators and Temeraire</span> it crosses into cringe territory: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he doesn't realize that he has only been just recently reinstated after having been discharged and transported to Australia following his treason that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">directly led to the (unsuccessful) invasion of Britain by France.</a> The extent of his memory loss also means Laurence has lost all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> that resulted from the experience, including his acceptance of his actions</span>. Readers are armed with this knowledge, plus the fact that Temeraire's naivety causes him to think nothing of Laurence's condition. So when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiaDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiaDanger">the topic is brought to light once again</a>, the result <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">isn't pretty</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with Laurence's parents and his midwingman Emily Roland.

Laurence is terribly embarrassed, but it would be horribly rude for his parents <em>or him</em> to discuss the subject directly, even to clear the misunderstanding.

The unawareness of the Zones of Thought on the part of all the characters leads to multiple examples of this.

<ul><li> Throughout the song, Stan grows increasingly unstable and angry with Eminem for not responding to his letters, and becomes more and more convinced Eminem is intentionally ignoring him. The listener probably figures that a musician as popular and well known as Eminem likely receives far too much fan mail to be able to respond to any of it quickly, Stan was probably just unlucky enough to get lost in the shuffle, and is too unstable to realize it. The music video takes this a step further by showing that Stan's suggestion in the first verse that "there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'" is actually true.
</li><li> The last verse completes it. Unlike the first three verses, which were addressed from Stan to Eminem, the last verse is Eminem's response to the letter in the second verse. He sees how unstable Stan is and says that he hopes the letter gets to him before it's too late and Stan ends up like the guy he saw on the news that killed himself and his pregnant girlfriend by driving them off a bridge. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's only at the very end of the verse that Eminem pieces together that it <em>is</em> too late and the guy on the news <em>was</em> Stan</span>.

<ul><li> It should go without saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> was rather fond of dramatic irony:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, Romeo kills himself on the assumption that Juliet's already dead. Wrong. Thanks to a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina">unlikely disasters</a>, Romeo has been left uninformed of Juliet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">plan to escape marriage to Paris</a>. Just to be really cruel to the audience, he makes a long speech before drinking the poison, long enough for the audience of the day to frantically (but silently) urge Juliet to wake up from her drug-induced sleep and prevent the tragedy. To modern audiences, <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is a serious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a> &mdash; and to be fair, Shakespeare makes it pretty clear from the beginning that this story isn't going to end well &mdash; but this scene is probably the biggest punch in the gut in a story <em>rife</em> with dramatic irony.
</li><li> Duncan's praise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> when he comes to stay at his castle seems just a little bit misplaced to the audience, who have recently heard Macbeth and his lady scheming to murder him. And for those who are aware of how the show will turn out, Duncan's words on the prior Thane of Cawdor, "He was a man in which I had built an infinite trust" makes one all the more aware that Duncan has really poor judgment of character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em>'s statements of trust and belief in "honest Iago" couldn't be more incorrect.
</li><li> On a lighter note, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em> is perfect for the comedic use of dramatic irony, featuring both twins <em>and</em> cross-dressing. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AsYouLikeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AsYouLikeIt">As You Like It</a></em> is particularly noteworthy for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCrossdressing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCrossdressing">Recursive Crossdressing</a>, which is dramatically ironic on multiple levels.
</li><li> There's the scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> where the prince considers killing the King while he's kneeling in prayer, only to decide not to, on the theory that killing him after he'd just prayed would send him to heaven rather than hell. Claudius however had just given a soliloquy about <em>not</em> being able to pray, so the audience knows Hamlet missed his best chance for revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> examples can be found in Greek plays, since most of these plays were based on stories that were already common knowledge to the audience. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusRex">Oedipus Rex</a></em>, Oedipus vows to track down Laius' killer... but the audience knows perfectly well that <em>he</em> is the killer, even though Oedipus himself does not. In fact, he also says at one point that he was going to "avenge Laius as if he was his son", not realizing that he was indeed Laius' son as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MadameButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MadameButterfly">Madame Butterfly</a></em> Butterfly spends almost the whole of the opera pouring out her love and devotion for Pinkerton. However, the audience (unlike Butterfly) heard the conversation Pinkerton had with Sharpless at the beginning of the opera: That this Japanese marriage was all nonsense, and that not very long from then, he'd leave Butterfly and have a perfectly proper American lifestyle with an American wife. This is somewhat less the case in the Belasco play, which has nothing corresponding to the opera's first act, but Butterfly still is unable to read between the lines of Pinkerton's letter, which implies that he no longer loves her.
</li><li> Anna Bolena spends the first half of her opera praising the faithfulness of her friend, Giovanna Seymour. Meanwhile, she curses the woman who has stolen Enrico's love from her. But the audience knows from the very first scene that Giovanna <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress">the other woman</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaCenerentola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaCenerentola">La Cenerentola</a>, Rossini's operatic take on Cinderella, features the comic version of this. The Prince, Ramiro, disguises himself as his valet in order to gauge the true personalities of potential future queens. Cenerentola (Cinderella) is kind and respectful to everyone, of course, and falls in love with the disguised Ramiro. She even refuses an offer of marriage from who she thinks is the real prince (the actual valet) in favor of him. The stepsisters of Cenerentola, however, treat the supposed valet with disgust and rudeness meanwhile treating the fake Prince like some sort of god. This makes for some truly hilarious comebacks when the stepsisters find out who the valet really is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheGirlFromTheGoldenWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheGirlFromTheGoldenWest">The Girl From The Golden West</a></em>, when the Girl is alone with Johnson for the first time and he voices concern for her security, she repeats to him what she told Ashby earlier, "I bet if a road-agent come in here, I could offer him a drink an' he'd treat me like a perfect lady," unaware that Johnson is none other than the road-agent Ramerrez whom Ashby and the other boys are out searching for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Arcadia">Arcadia</a></em> is a heart-wrenching example of this, even though the play is pretty comedic. Due to it's narrative structure, the audience sees the events that happen in the 1800s that the modern-day researchers get wrong, and are also told by the modern-day characters what will ultimately happen to the characters in the 1800s. In the last scene of the play, the audience is already aware that Thomasina <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">will burn to death the night before her seventeenth birthday</span> and that her tutor Septimus<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> will go insane and die a hermit, writing "reams of cabbalistic proofs that the world is coming to an end."</span> Thomasina invites Septimus, who is in love with her, to come upstairs with her, but he declines, not wanting to ruin her reputation (he has just spent the play ruining lots of reputations and getting out of trouble on charm alone). Then, just to twist the knife a little bit deeper, Stoppard has Septimus hand Thomasina her essay on thermodynamics, light Thomasina's candle and tell her to be careful with the flame. Not a dry eye in the house.

<ul><li> Hyde singles out upper-class hypocrites as his targets at first, ignoring that Jekyll himself is a hypocrite for creating Hyde and indulging in his vices.
</li><li> The Bishop of Basingstoke asks Jekyll a question after he finishes pitching his proposition to test his formula on human subjects, a question that only the audience can truly appreciate the importance of: "And what if you're right, Jekyll?

In particular, One Short Day is so full of hope and happiness in sharp contrast to everything after it.
<ul><li> Also, both Elphaba and the Wizard mention a "celebration throughout Oz that's all to do with" her. We, as the audience, have already seen this celebration: Munchkinland is celebrating her death.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> plays with this trope in the cinematic introduction to the <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> expansion, which features a retrospective voiceover by Arthas Menethil's father encouraging his young son to use his powers for good. The irony is that the voiceover plays over Arthas as the Lich King, commanding the vast undead armies of Northrend after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">betraying his people</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing his father</span>. This scene turns out to be doubly ironic when it's revealed that the soul of Terenas Menethil is trapped within Frostmourne along with every other soul consumed by the dread blade, and actually speaks to Arthas, chiding him for his poor decisions. To squeeze out the very final drop of irony, the concluding cinematic of the Icecrown Citadel dungeon features Terenas telling his dying son that it's now, finally, over, making this also an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a>.

</li><li> This is showcased heavily in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> games. Two series-spanning ones that cover the origin of Solid Snake and Metal Gear respectively are seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3">Metal Gear Solid 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> The one about Solid Snake's origins have the young Big Boss talk to his medical support member, Para-Medic who happens to specialize in the field of genetics, about the nature of human cloning and genetic engineering. She tells Big Boss that when the science behind genetics advance enough they will be able to isolate what genes are desirable, take those genes and not only enhance already living people but be able to clone a human being with those particular traits, and his genes will be in high demand one day. Big Boss denounces human cloning as immoral, saying that, "You can't mass-produce human beings.", and that he is sure the government would never do something like that to him. Big Boss is proved wrong, very wrong, when the Patriots later not only clone him but genetically alter soldiers with his DNA.
</li><li> The young Big Boss first learns of the origins of Metal Gear from a drunken Russian scientist who had lost out on funding dollars for his project in place of the Shagohad, a similar but not as advanced mobile nuclear platform since it relies on rocket boosters and not its own movement speed to achieve what it does. This man Granin explains to Big Boss that artillery is too heavy to be mobile and infantry is mobile but not as heavily armored as artillery, so you need to find a way to combine the two, Metal Gear is that missing link because its mobility comes from giving it legs. Metal Gear has the firepower of artillery and the mobility of infantry allowing it to traverse any terrain and destroy the enemy with devastating fire power, not to mention its nuclear payload that can be fired from anywhere in the world. So why was a nuclear platform like the Shagohad chosen over Metal Gear? Metal Gear was simply so far ahead of its time that Granin's employer Volgin didn't have the technology needed to build Metal Gear and so it had to be abandoned, but Granin predicts very accurately that one day Russia will come to fear Metal Gear despite denying its funding now. Sigint, Big Boss's technology expert, denounces Metal Gear viewing it as an absurd idea that only a crackpot scientist would think of, citing that legs would reduce a tank's traction and make it a walking bulls eye since it would move too slow to avoid enemy fire. Ironically Metal Gear's technology is advanced enough that its legs make it very fast, far faster than any tank, and along with its nuclear payload every country on Earth gets into an arms race over who can make the best Metal Gear. Granin's prediction of his machine becoming desired and feared comes true. The icing on top of the irony cake is that Sigint ends up making a Metal Gear regardless of his earlier dismissal of the machine.

Von Karma disagrees, saying there are people like that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To the player who knows von Karma killed Edgeworth's father, the implication is that von Karma is referring to himself. However, the very next case in <em>Investigations</em> deals with a criminal who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">hides behind his diplomatic immunity</a>, making him "above the law".</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Case 3 of <em>Investigations 2</em> takes this up even further: you get to play as Gregory Edgeworth during his last case, going up against Manfred von Karma. By now, most players will know <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">just how this ends...</a></span> It's made all the worse by the fact Gregory realizes von Karma is a monster the moment he meets him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he just doesn't realize how much...</span> Similar to the 4th game's example above, the final deduction you have to make in the past segment is one the player <em>knows</em> will have horrible consequences, but the game won't continue until you present it. In case it wasn't obvious by now, it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "von Karma forged the autopsy report."</span> And since von Karma still has his perfect record by the time of 1-4, you know Gregory won't be able to get the defendant cleared, and that the real killer will get away with it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fortunately, Miles manages to resolve everything when the case is re-opened in the present day.</span>
</li><li> Case 4 of <em>Justice for All</em> includes a scene in which Phoenix goes to his client's house to feed his cat and has a friendly conversation with his butler. While this is not a significant event for Phoenix, it is EXTREMELY significant to the player: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in an earlier scene, the player sees Maya's kidnapper from her perspective. Said kidnapper is the same person as the butler Phoenix chats with later on. As a result, the player starts to suspect Matt Engarde of wrongdoing long before Phoenix.</span> Once again, this event doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>.
</li><li> The tendency to present cases out of chronological order comes to a head in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Dual Destinies</a></em>, where in the fourth case, it's mentioned that the body was discovered by the director of the space center, Yuri Cosmos, and a detective, Candice Arme, a specialist in cases involving explosives. Having already played the first case, the player already knows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Candice Arme will never actually be called to testify, as she was bludgeoned to death by Ted Tonate earlier in the day, and also the case that you're currently trying is going to be interrupted by someone <em>blowing up the courtroom</em></span>.
</li><li> Then there's the fact that Trucy Wright's mother, Thalassa Gramarye <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is not only alive, but also had another child &mdash; Apollo &mdash; with another man before she married Zak Gramarye.</span> Two games later, and the two of them still don't know that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're actually half-siblings.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a> is turned up even further in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em>, where the culprit of the second case, upon being revealed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revels in the fact that it was Apollo who saw through his magic trick, and not Trucy, because it meant that in the end, the heir to the Gramarye name did not beat him. The player meanwhile knows that, since Apollo is also the son of Thalassa, it <em>was</em> a Gramarye that brought Retinz down in the end.</span>
</li><li> And during the last case of <em>Spirit of Justice</em>, we find out the untimely fate of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apollo's biological father. He was a travelling musician who died in an arson in a foreign country. Other characters say that, since all of his belongings burned up in the blaze and the police force was in a state of chaos because their queen also died in the fire, Apollo's mother most likely never found out what happened to her husband and child. Apollo briefly laments the fact that he never knew his mother and she probably doesn't know that he is alive, even though, unbeknownst to him, he actually met her on a case a few games ago!</span>

However, Jaune later confides to his friends that Weiss is the most incredible girl he has ever met, lists all her positive qualities like her intelligence and singing ability, and honestly doesn't understand why she won't return his feelings. Pyrrha comments he should have just told Weiss that amazing speech instead of swaggering and using corny pickup lines. For extra irony, Jaune doesn't notice Pyrrha has feelings for <em>him</em>, and thinks such a famous person like her has several dates, when it's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon">the opposite</a>.

<ul><li> The roleplayers know that, in the RPG they're playing, planet Naboo has been destroyed and Jar Jar Binks is now dead. The characters they're roleplaying don't know this yet.

Note that at this point Annie (but not Princess) has all the information needed to deduce why there <em>is</em>, but Corey (who wasn't there for the first three games) <em>doesn't</em>, and she knows that too.

So he destroyed all of the evidence and killed the cryptographers. Which got him sent to the Castle anyway. The irony? The reason Merlot couldn't find Agatha was because <em>she was already aboard Castle Wulfenbach</em> and by the time Merlot started destroying evidence, the Baron probably had already discovered her identity.

He then tells her that he probably would have agreed to go out with her if she'd asked, but that the whole thing was just a big daydream and that he's actually really relieved to have just one friend who has no potential romantic interest in him. He then asks if she can spare a friendly ear while he confides in some stuff and Jane, semi-hysterically, accepts. He then goes on to talk about how he's pretty sure Dirk has a crush on him and that he's actually not 100% opposed to the idea of going out with him, and asks whether or not she thinks that's weird. All throughout Jane is trying her very, <em>very</em> best to be the friend that he requests, but to the audience it's incredibly obvious that she could not possibly be feeling more uncomfortable.</span>

He predicts the order's reaction, and Roy's having to admit that he's a valuable team member &mdash; while the audience sees one of their foes coming down the way. And this is hardly even the first, last, or best example. Much of the suspense Rich Burlew generates comes from the audience being shown something important that the characters would want to know, but which they nonetheless remain blithely ignorant of up until the moment where their lack of awareness costs them dearly.
</li><li> After the Order's first encounter with Xykon, Roy was under the belief that Xykon had been destroyed and he had finally fulfilled his father's blood oath, unaware that Xykon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">phylactery</a> would enable him to regenerate a new body.

He concludes that in a world where people didn't know for certain the afterlife was a real place, there would be much less war.

They eventually discover which of their memories were faked, but can't regain the old ones. One of the faked memories is the wedding between the doctor and the reverend. They spend the entire night crying, since they're not married any more. What they don't realize is that they <em>are</em> still married. The same UNS admiral who wiped their memories gave them a short but completely legal (and theologically sound) marriage ceremony before their minds were altered.

The web-movie has companion short feature that is basically the story from the perspective of the guy controlling the world boss. It shows him getting bored out his mind waiting for people to show up and getting the impression that nodody cares about his questline despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> being the alternative to fighting him.
