An Age Lift is when the age of the character in question is changed or glossed over for the sake of the story. The idea is that the discrepancy between character and actor is much smaller, and in some cases, the exact age is not that important to the character. In some cases, this can simply be a case of the creators avoiding the embarrassing issue of a less than wholesome relationship, or wanting to give two characters more of a connection (not necessarily a friendly one; it can be used to emphasise a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>) by making them contemporaries. Or maybe the creators just think the original age of the characters doesn't fit their target audience.
</p><p>In live action, it can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a> to take into account factors such as child labour laws and how demanding a role may be for a younger actor. It is also likely to occur if something happens to the character within the source material which makes keeping them at their original age problematic even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a>, but, because the event in question is essential to the plot, leaving it out isn't an option either. The two most common forms of this appear to be aging pre-teen characters to teenagers so twenty-somethings can feasibly play them and aging thirty-something parents by about a decade to counter the potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> relating to young parents.

<ul><li> The English dubs to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> went all over the place with this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">The first series</a> left the ages alone, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">the second one</a>, a three year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> sequel to the first, aged everyone up by an extra year. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Tamers</a></em>, perhaps because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>, aged the ten-year-old main characters up by two years... which ended up creating some rather poor implications that <em>weren't</em> originally there, as at one point Ruki/Rika's mother's age is explicitly stated and this age is left unchanged, dropping the age difference between mother and daughter from 18 years to 16. Meanwhile, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier's</a></em> dub aged most of the children by a year as per the second series, but didn't do so with the youngest member of the team, increasing the age difference between him and the rest of the characters from two to three-four years.
</li><li> The character of Nobue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em> is aged up from sixteen years old in the manga to twenty in the anime. This isn't done to match a particular actor, but because Nobue is a habitual smoker and drinker and they couldn't show her doing that on TV if she was underage.
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkuNoHana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkuNoHana">Aku no Hana</a></em> changes the characters from middle school students to high school kids, possibly due to the violent and psychosexual nature of the story, not to mention the animation is rotoscoped.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Classi9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Classi9">Classi9</a></em> has an interesting example, especially if considering the respective timelines of the real-life musicians. Haydn, who was born before all the other composers except for Bach, ended up being the youngest member of the cast. The rest is at least 16, but no older than 18, which makes Wagner roughly the same age as Liszt even though he married his daughter in real life. Beethoven is about as old as Mozart, even though in real life he was young enough to be his pupil. Bach remains the oldest and most responsible member of the cast, though.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney">Cutey Honey</a></em> anime and manga, Honey and Natsuko are both high school students. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCutieHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCutieHoney">Re: Cutie Honey</a></em> (as well as the live-action movie that inspired it), they're both young adults, with Honey working as a temp and Natsuko working as a police inspector.
</li><li> In the '60s animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg 009</a></em> films (as well as the ensuing 1968 animated series), Cyborg 007 was changed from a middle-aged man to a young child. Reportedly, this is because the producers really wanted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Kid-Appeal Character</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">audience to relate to</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mamoru Chiba a.k.a. Tuxedo Mask in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> is 17 in the manga and 21 in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">1990s anime</a>. This actually means the romance between he and Usagi - whose age is 14 in both - is toned down perhaps due to the larger age gap. In the anime Usagi and Mamoru's relationship comes across to some viewers like a college student allowing a teen girl who has a crush on him to say he's her boyfriend to keep her happy, whereas in the manga there is little doubt in the romance. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em> has him at 16.
</li><li> In the 90s anime Chibiusa is the same age she seems to be physically. In the manga, however, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>, having been born when Usagi was in her early twenties but perpetually being stuck in a child's body.
</li><li> Had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToonMakersSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToonMakersSailorMoon">Toon Makers gotten the English rights to the series for their proposed live-action and animated adaptation</a>, Sailor Moon would've gone from 14 to 16, as mentioned in their theme song. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC">DiC</a> dub kept her at 14.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WonderMomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WonderMomo">Wonder Momo</a></em> webcomic, Momoko's love interest Natsuhiko is clearly somewhere between 23 and 25. In the anime, he's changed into a high school contemporary of Momoko's. His personality also changes, going from cocksure adult to insecure teenager.
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazaeSan">Sazae-san</a></em> lowered the age of most of the family. Sazae was 27 in the manga, now 24 in the anime.
</li><li> Zelda in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend Of Zelda I</a></em> is a young child roughly the same age as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> Link. Zelda in one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLegendOfZeldaI">manga based off said game</a> is a teenager. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Link is also older than he should be, being Zelda's older half-brother, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">looks younger</a> than Zelda due to being part elf.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV">Street Fighter II V</a></em> anime, Chun-Li is a 15-year-old martial arts student instead of an adult policewoman like she is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">games</a>. Ryu and Ken are also both younger than their game counterparts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em> is eleven. Ash, Red's anime counterpart, was ten when he began his journey, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">and still is two decades on</a>.
</li><li> Serena from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em> has no official age but seems to be around 16 to 19, confirmed by the fact she's older than the canonically 16 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emma</span>. In the anime she's Ash's age (10). She's noticeably taller than Clemont in the games but is around the same height as him in the anime.
</li><li> Tate and Liza seem older in the anime than they did in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>. Tate especially looks less boyish than in the games and has a teenage sounding voice.
</li><li> Lillie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em> is around 11 years old in-game, but she's noticeably taller than the protagonists and even her own older brother. In the anime, she's given a much softer and younger-looking appearance and is shorter than her brother, around the same height as Ash.
</li><li> All of the Trial Captains in the games are around 13 - 19. In the anime, the Trial Captain class is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>, and the trainers are 10 - 12 instead (with the probable exception of Kiawe). In the meanwhile, Island Kahuna Hapu is a young adult in the games, but is shown to be 11 in the anime.
</li><li> According to the remakes, May is twelve. In the anime, she is assumed to be ten like Ash.
</li></ul></li><li> Misty is officially ten in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> anime but is twelve in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElectricTaleOfPikachu">The Electric Tale of Pikachu</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pok&eacute;mon Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> The timeline of the manga screws up the ages of the Pokedex Holders. The games are not in straight chronological order as they contain multiple timeskips and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a></span>. <em>Adventures</em> streamlined everything. For example, in the games May and Brendan are either the same age or slightly older (their canon ages are 12 instead of 11 like Red, but Red had already began his adventure when the Hoenn games started) than Red and Blue.

However, the movie implies that the Dashwood sisters are in their late and early 20s, respectively and that Colonel Brandon is an older world-weary gent that we would associate with someone nearing 50. Lee and (scriptwriter) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaThompson">Emma Thompson</a> made a conscious decision to age Elinor up to at least her mid-twenties, because they didn't think the audience would accept a 19-year-old worrying about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid">being left on the shelf</a>.

Which could cause problems if they ever get around to filming the fourth book, <em>The Tin Princess</em>.
</li><li> This probably has to do more with legal compliance than artistic reason, but no matter what actress is playing her, the character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lolita">Lolita</a></em> always starts the movie at age 14 or 15 rather than 12, which she is at the beginning of the book.
</li><li> In the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun">Logan's Run</a></em>, the mandatory death age was increased to 30 (compared to the book's 21) for this reason. The book's notion that there's <em>no</em> age of sexual consent: as soon as a citizen leaves the creche, anything goes probably doesn't help.

Aside from narrowing down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> factor, this avoids the practical impossibility of a five-year-old actress playing a believable adult character.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dune">Dune</a></em>: None of the actors who've played Paul, Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, or Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen have been under 20. Of course, since Paul and Feyd-Rautha were 15 during <em>Dune</em> itself and Leto II and Ghanima were <em>8</em> this is understandable. Generally, Paul and Feyd's ages are not mentioned in the adaptations, which makes this arguably a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a>, but for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SyFy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SyFy">Syfy</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChildrenOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChildrenOfDune">Children of Dune</a></em>, Leto and Ghanima's ages were upped to around 18. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dune1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dune1984">1984 adaptation of Dune</a> also has the four-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Alia</a> played by the nine-year-old (at time of release) Alicia Witt.
</li><li> One of the biggest criticisms of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">A View to a Kill</a></em> was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerMoore">Roger Moore</a> was still playing Bond at age 57 (he was 45 he was first cast as Bond in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie">Live and Let Die</a></em>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a> himself said "Bond should be played by an actor 35, 33 years old. I'm too old. Roger's too old, too!" Even when he was first cast, Moore violated the canon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s novels, which established that Bond faced mandatory retirement at age 45 (meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> was technically too old for the role for most of his time as Bond, too).
<ul><li> Turned on its head in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> where one of the main themes of the movie is how Bond (played by the 44-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig">Daniel Craig</a>) is getting too old to keep working in the field.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the main cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> was aged up from their preteens. Most notorious in Annabeth's case - sure, they aged her up from twelve to sixteen, but that didn't stop Alexandria Daddario from being in her early twenties.
</li><li> The musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NineMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NineMusical">Nine</a></em> is about a filmmaker experiencing a mid-life crisis as he turns forty. For the film version, his age was upped to fifty to match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> (52 in 2009, when the film was released).
</li><li> In every film and television version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights">Wuthering Heights</a></em>, Heathcliff and Cathy are played by the adult actors during the scene where they eavesdrop on the Lintons, making giggling comments. In the novel they are children at this time, explaining their childish behavior. Catherine is only 19 when she <em>dies</em>. Heathcliff was 20, and he was 16 when he ran away. No adaptation has even gotten close to the correct ages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> has Silk Spectre II and the Comedian. In the original comic, the Comedian was 16 at the time of WWII while Silk Spectre was 19. In the film, they were aged up to their 20s since neither of the actors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlaGugino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlaGugino">Carla Gugino</a> as Sally/Silk Spectre I and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffreyDeanMorgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffreyDeanMorgan">Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a> as the Comedian) could pass for teens.
</li><li> In the book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, the band of droogies were adolescents of 15. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> chose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmMcDowell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmMcDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a> for the role of Alex, all were aged up accordingly. Echoes of the book occur when Alex is depicted as school age and when (years later) Dim describes himself and his partner as "of job age" in the scene where they torture Alex.
<ul><li> The book includes a scene where Alex lures two ten-year-old girls to his apartment, then drugs and rapes them. The film switches this to him having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalConsent">consensual</a> threesome with two girls his own age. While one can understand Kubrick for not wanting to adapt the pedophilia scene (especially since this film is rather blatant with nudity), this pretty much changes the scene from "Alex is even more of a deranged psycho than you thought" to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Deranged psychos like Alex get to have awesome sex</a>!"

While modern retcons eventually established that the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a>" thing was a cover, to hide the fact that Bucky was a very young-looking teenager (15 in the beginning and a legal adult at 18 by the time of his "death," something the army would often look the other way about in those days) who doubled as a wetworks operative, the filmmakers behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em> decided to give him an additional bump up to his mid-to-late 20s in addition to making them childhood friends, significantly altering the dynamic between them from mentor/student to peers. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">second film</a> gives his year of birth as 1916 or 1917 (the props don't agree), which actually makes him <em>older</em> than Cap, whose birth year is given as 1918 in the script. (And yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SebastianStan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SebastianStan">Sebastian Stan</a> is actually a year younger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisEvans">Chris Evans</a>...)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2">Iron Man 2</a></em>, Justin Hammer is depicted as a middle-aged man and played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRockwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRockwell">Sam Rockwell</a>. This is in sharp contrast to the comics, where Hammer is an old man with an adult granddaughter.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em> has two major cases. In the comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a> is roughly the same age as his contemporary heroes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">Bruce Banner</a>, but in the film, he's portrayed by 70-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDouglas">Michael Douglas</a>. This makes the character a veteran superhero who was actually active decades <em>before</em> people like Iron Man and the Avengers showed up on the scene, in contrast to the comics, where he was a founding Avenger. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you have Darren Cross, who is a middle-aged businessman with an adult son in the comics, but in the film is played by 38-year-old Corey Stoll.

During his debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>, Peter is still a 14/15-year-old high schooler, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em> has Jessica much older (the actresses for Jessica and her classmate-turned-adoptive sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PatsyWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PatsyWalker">Trish Walker</a> are in their 30s). This is at least partially due to the fact that the <em>Jessica Jones</em> series was written and conceived way before Marvel and Sony had worked out a deal to get Spider-Man into the MCU, meaning at the time, there was no real reason to make sure their ages lined up.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther</a></em>, T'Challa and Nakia are roughly the same age, and are childhood friends and former lovers. This is in <em>sharp</em> contrast to the comics, where Nakia was only a teenager and had an unrequited crush on T'Challa. Okoye was also a teenager in the comics, but is a grown woman in the film. In fact, her actress, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanaiGurira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanaiGurira">Danai Gurira</a>, is only about two years younger than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChadwickBoseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChadwickBoseman">Chadwick Boseman</a>.

It's worth noting that the film is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece">Period Piece</a> set in 1995, and at least 24 years go by between <em>Captain Marvel</em> and the next theatrically-released MCU movie, during which time it can be presumed she grew up.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Though it seems odd, the film adaptations change the ages <em>accidentally</em> with Lily and James Potter. Looking at the flashback clips, the moving pictures, and the images in the Mirror of Erised, Lily and James appear to have been in their 30s or 40s when they had Harry. It could make sense, since their ages weren't revealed until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">seventh book</a>, six years after the first movie had been made. Though the film versions of Harry's parents look quite middle-aged, the book version of Harry's parents were only 20 when they had Harry and 21 when they died. Then again, the whole film timeline seems to be shifted compared to the books - all the dates on the headstones remain the same (including Lily's and James'), but things that didn't exist when the books were set (such as the Millennium Bridge and Oyster card readers) appear, suggesting that Lily and James' generation were all <em>born</em> at the same time as in the books, but just took longer to have kids.
</li><li> Cho Chang is a year older than Harry in the books. A line from Hermione in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">fifth film</a> implies she is in the same year as them.
</li><li> Romilda Vane was two years younger than Harry and should have been in her fourth year when Harry was in his sixth year in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>. Likewise Katie Bell is one year ahead of Harry and in her seventh year but is seen along with Romilda in the sixth years' potions class in the film.
</li><li> Initially averted with Filius Flitwick in the first two films, where he is portrayed as an old white-haired man as he is in the books. However, his appearance changed drastically after Chris Columbus stopped directing the films, suddenly turning into a younger-looking dark-haired man.
</li><li> Gabrielle Delacour is a few years older in the movies than she is in the books since she&#146;s old enough to go to school at Beauxbatons.
</li></ul></li><li> In the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneFatSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneFatSummer">One Fat Summer</a></em>, Bobby Marks and Jodie Williams are both 14, Willie Rumson and his gang are hovering at 17-18, Pete Marino is in his early 20s, and Dr. Kahn's age is vague. Cue the movie adaptation, "Measure of a Man," and Bobby and Jodie are now 16, Rumson is old enough to have served a tour in Vietnam AND been Pete's bully, and Dr. Kahn is clearly a holocaust survivor.
</li><li> In the book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TuckEverlasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TuckEverlasting">Tuck Everlasting</a></em>, Winnie is eleven. To both fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Dawson Casting</a> of Alexis Bledel and lessen the weirdness of her romance with forever 17-year-old Tuck, she is aged up to 15 in the movie.
</li><li> The 1979 film <em>Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline</em> cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> in a leading role. Hepburn was in her 50s, but the character was written as being in her 30s. Hepburn looked great, but could never pass for someone in her 30s, so not only did an age lift occur in the film, Sheldon went back and revised his own novel for new editions, raising the character's age to match that of the film.
</li><li> In the novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beaches">Beaches</a></em>, the friends Cee Cee and Bertie meet at the respective ages of ten and seven, and first reunite in their teens. The movie changes things so both are eleven when they first meet, then reunite when they're in their twenties. This was likely due to not wanting to cast separate actresses for the girls' teenage years, the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BetteMidler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BetteMidler">Bette Midler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraHershey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraHershey">Barbara Hershey</a> couldn't play <em>that</em> young, and probably to have less of an age difference between the two characters.
</li><li> In all the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> movies, Superman's alien father Jor-El is played by middle-aged actors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellCrowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellCrowe">Russell Crowe</a>) with graying or silver hair. In the Superman comics, Jor-El was a young man who looked exactly like Superman when Krypton blew up (after all, Kal-El was a baby when his father died).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> movies feature Wednesday as a young teenager or tween, as opposed to the TV show in which she was a little girl.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsArithmetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsArithmetic">The Devil's Arithmetic</a></em> book, Hannah is twelve. In the film she is aged up to around seventeen (she is old enough to drive and get a tattoo). Rivka is ten in the books but is aged up to around fourteen or fifteen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Pevensie Children are a bit older in the Walden Media films than they were in the books. Peter is 13-14 but William Moseley was 16 when the first film was made. Caspian in the books is said to be the same age as Peter so the second film ages him up too. The age differences are notable in all of the actors since only a year has passed between the first and second films, but they were filmed three years apart.
</li><li> The '80s BBC adaptation also does this with Edmund and Lucy - their actor and actress were in their early teens, while in the books the characters are 10-13 and 8-11, respectively. Peter and Susan are the ages of their book counterparts, though - which creates the sense that Mr. and Mrs. Pevensie had all four of of their children in <em>extremely</em> short succession.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em> (1964) she is played by the 25-year-old Julie Andrews.

Judy Garland was sixteen when she played her in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> (Barry Norman's book <em>The Hollywood Greats</em> and other sources says Dorothy was meant to be twelve in the film).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToOz">Return to Oz</a></em> averts this by having Dorothy at eight, which is much closer to the books.
</li><li> Dorothy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em> is under ten and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz">The Wiz</a></em> musical she is a teenager. In <em>The Wiz</em>'s movie, Dorothy is in her twenties and is a school teacher, played by Diana Ross, who was thirty-four at the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em>, the Wicked Witch of the West is so old and evil that all the blood has dried up in her veins. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">MGM film</a> she is aged down to be considerably more younger. While not young, she's certainly not a senior. Most adaptations use this interpretation.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2005">Fantastic Four (2005)</a></em>, Johnny is already a former astronaut and presumably in his mid-to-late 20s, justifying his presence on the mission in the first place.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> had to change the ages of most of the main characters to be more in their early teens. This is probably because one of the major problems with prior attempts to film the book was that a large portion of the cast is made up of children, and in addition to getting a sufficient number of good child actors the ones that were cast would keep growing up before it could enter production. It also probably didn't help that there was quite a bit of violence among the children in the book, at least two of whom were (unknowingly) murdered by Ender.
</li><li> <em>Batman</em> film series:

<ul><li> While the Penguin is generally depicted as older than Batman, he is now apparently around Gordon's age, which makes the age difference somewhat larger.
</li><li> Bullock is a little older than Gordon is. He looks the same age as his comics counterpart who reports to an older Commissioner Gordon. Likewise, Sarah Essen is older than Gordon, as opposed to being younger than him.

Likewise, Cosmo Krank/The Toymaker, a character created for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em>, was depicted as around Bruce's age in that show and already an adult in <em>Gotham</em>.

Pennyworth himself is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a> concerning his age relative to Bruce Wayne's, but as a whole averts this trope.

In the adaptation, she is several years older. Although her age is not stated, she is seemingly closer to Peter's age. This change was made because the episode places more emphasis on Charity and Peter being each other's first love than the original story. There is also the scene in which Squire Jonas Hacker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">attempts to rape</a> Charity after claiming that she needed to disrobe so that he could check her for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfTheBeast">mark of a witch</a>, which is toned down in the episode compared to the short story.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Dick Grayson</a> was in his late teens when the New Teen Titans were formed in the comics.

</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderGirl">Donna Troy</a> was established as being roughly around Dick's age in the comics. She's slightly older than him (but still young enough to have been his contemporary in the original Titans) in the show, which would also put her in her late 20s.

In the TV show, they're all teenagers who attend the same high school as Courtney, who is much younger than them in the comics.
</li><li> Odd example with Starman and Stripsey. In the original comics, Sylvester Pemberton was 61 years old when he died, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">had the body of a young man in his early 20s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside">due to having been lost in time for several decades</a>. His partner Pat Dugan was even older, albeit with the same slowed aging applied. The TV show moves Pemberton and Dugan's origins as the Star-Spangled Kid and Stripsey from the early 1940s to sometime in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> and ditches the time lost aspect entirely, meaning they were in their 30s when Pemberton died. The show also lessens the age gap between the two, with Pat mentioning that he was 20 when he first met the 15-year-old Sylvester. This is in contrast to the original Golden Age comics, where Pat always looked <em>significantly</em> older than Sylvester.
</li><li> This seems to be the case for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">JSA</a> in general. In the original comics, the JSA was formed in the 1940s, with many of its surviving members remaining supernaturally young for one reason or another. The TV show is vague about when exactly the JSA was formed, but most of its members were played by actors in their 30s-to-late-40s in the flashback scenes set 10 years in the past. This also applies to their enemies, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Injustice Society</a>.

The verse about taking the box to a shopkeeper only for the shopkeeper to kick the protagonist out and threaten to call the police was changed to be about the boy taking the box with him to school only to scare away his classmates and get expelled after the teacher saw what was in the box, while the verse about the man showing the box to his wife was changed so that the boy got kicked out of home for trying to show the box to his father.

The play has contradictory lines about the prince's age - some evidence suggesting he's thirty or older, other lines indicating he's a fresh-faced college undergrad. Plus, the role has acquired a reputation as being the "crown jewel" of an actor's career, so you'll find men cast as Hamlet when they're in middle-age, usually at the height of their fame.

The opposite is true for John Proctor, who was sixty in real life but is in his thirties in the play. This is pretty much entirely in service of the (entirely fictional) plot arc involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">an affair between Proctor and Williams</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">Matilda</a></em>, Michael Wormwood is stated to be five years older than his sister Matilda, making him 10 in the book. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Matilda">The musical adaptation</a> makes him a teenager played by an adult, presumably to have one less child role that would need to be double cast.

This contrasts with the earlier <em>Romeus and Juliet</em> where she was fifteen-going-on-sixteen and in Matteo Bandello's novels where she was eighteen. One interpretation on why Shakespeare made Juliet only fourteen was to make the story a cautionary tale against marrying too young. At any rate, it makes her all the more vulnerable and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">ending</a> more tragic.

Lots of changes in characters' ages were done; mostly because the production team of the webseries were recent graduates when they started, and some of them were friends from school, which means they are more or less the same age:
<ul><li> Jane Eyre was 18 in the novel; here she's 21 and a college graduate with a degree in nursing. Her actress is 24.
