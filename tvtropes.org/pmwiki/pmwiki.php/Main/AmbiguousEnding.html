<ul><li> One of the most classic examples is the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, where after his final fight with Vicious, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spike limps down the stairs to find an armed guard surrounding him, only to raise his hand in a gun shape and say "Bang," before collapsing</span>. The series director, Shinichir&#333; Watanabe, purposefully keeps the ambiguous tone in interviews, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saying that Spike was "probably just sleeping."</span>
</li><li> In the finale of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch is apparently killed by his friend, Suzaku, dressed in the infamous Zero outfit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">after having planned to make the world hate him, so as to unite in peace after his assassination.</a> This is all well and good, until at the very end C.C. is being pulled along in a wagon driven by a man with hidden features, during which time she talks about how she was wrong about the isolating nature of Geass, addressing Lelouch as though he may be alive.</span> This is further supported by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nunnally receiving visions of Lelouch's memories upon touching him after his assassination, encouraging the theory that Lelouch absorbed his father's Code during his final confrontation with him, becoming immortal upon getting impaled rather than dying.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain">Count Cain</a></em>: A grown-up Merryweather sees the Hargreaves ring next to a teacup and thinks Cain kept his promise of having tea with her. It turns out that Cleahadol was the one to leave the ring there, and flashes back to what seems to be moments after the series' climax. He finds the skeletal remains of Riff with glass shards in his back, draped around Cain. Cain has his eyes closed, but no blood on him. Cleahadol himself mentions that he isn't sure if he really did hear Cain talk or it was his ability as a medium letting him speak to Cain's spirit, but he was told to leave the ring with Merryweather eventually. It's not made clear if Cain was dead or simply chose to remain with his dead servant. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Kaori Yuuki</a> said she felt this ending was perfect for the series, as it went well with the overall feeling and leaving this mystery open.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>: Occurs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoraemonV3C1AWorldWithoutSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoraemonV3C1AWorldWithoutSound">"A World Without Sound"</a>. Noby and Doraemon speak to the "What if? Box" and tell it to take away the sound from the world. They plan to later tell the device to turn the world back to normal. However, the way Noby and Doraemon get home is left up to the reader's interpretation. They can't tell the "What if?" Box to bring the sound back because they can't speak to it. Some readers think the "What if?" Box can detect their handwriting, though this isn't stated anywhere in the comic.
</li><li> The result of the duel between Yugi and Jonouchi in the final episode of the Battle City arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> is never shown. Many fans actually beleive that Jonouchi won, seeing as it's the most likely reason why he got his Red Eyes B. Dragon card back (which he told Yugi to keep in an early episode of the arc, but which he has in the next arc; since Yugi and Jonouchi were still playing by Battle City rules, the ante rule presumably still stood). In fact, that was the biggest reason why he told Yugi to hold onto it; he didn't think he deserved to use it until he was a strong enough duelist to prove it.
</li><li> Likewise, the ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> was left deliberately ambiguous. The final episode consisted of a duel between Judai and Yugi, and although there was no official ending, it can be implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yugi</span> won.
</li><li> The conclusion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns">A Cruel God Reigns</a></em>. It's not really clear whether Jeremy and Ian become a couple, or where their relationship will go from there.
</li><li> <em>Storm Thief</em> is probably the best example: the golem is floating randomly in the ocean, unable to control himself; the flotilla trying to escape the island has got away, but what they'll find on land (assuming they reach it) is totally uncertain; and the entire city is in the grip of the mother of all probability storms, meaning pretty much anything is possible there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistTheConquerorOfShamballa">Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa</a></em> ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alphonse and Edward together but on the wrong side of the Gate.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainEarth">Captain Earth</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Do Daichi and Hana survive the destruction of the Blume, or do they die?</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> the old man and granddaughter decide the story is better off with no ending, so the audience can imagine what happens next.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Fireworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Fireworks">Fireworks</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The bauble is destroyed by the drunkard firework craftsman firing it, and Norimichi grabs one of the shards showing glimpses of possible futures. He dives into the sea to be with Nazuna and they kiss and converse a bit more before she swims away. The next day, Nazuna's seat in class is empty and Norimichi is absent. Did they successfully elope? Did they drown in the sea? Was everything that happened in between Nazuna getting dragged off by her mother and the next day scene merely Norimichi's fantasy like in the original short? Is there some other explanation for the couple's absence?</span> We never find out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Granbelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Granbelm">Granbelm</a></em>: The story ends with a transfer student joining the class Shingetsu is sitting in and the ethereal glow on Shingetsu due to being doomed to live forever but never exist disappears. While her narration and reaction hints that it may be Mangetsu reborn, the episode ends before showing the girl's face or if people can see Shingetsu.

Either way, it ends with the two of them still laughing, as their silhouettes in the puddle are broken up by raindrops, and the red and blue lights of approaching police cars.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdman">Birdman</a></em> has what could be called two ambiguous endings, depending on a person's interpretation.
<ul><li> One theory is that Riggan <em>did</em> in fact successfully commit suicide onstage, and everything afterwards is a hallucination/afterlife sequence.
</li><li> Assuming the previous theory to be false, the final ending of the movie leaves Riggan standing, optimistic outside his hospital room window, at a height certainly high enough to kill him should he fall. The camera pans away to see his daughter, Sam, enter the room, and, once worriedly looking down from the window to see if he had jumped, slowly looks upwards towards the sky, as her expression changes to jubilant excitement. Throughout the film, it has been hinted that Riggan does in fact have superpowers, that nobody but himself can see; this theory says that, instead of simply dying after falling out of the window, after telling Birdman, "Goodbye, and fuck you," he frees himself of the restraints of his former life, and his daughter can now see him flying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGraduate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGraduate">The Graduate</a></em> ends with a famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatNowEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatNowEnding">"What Now?" Ending</a>. Ben whisks Elaine away from her wedding to some other dude, but their uncertain stares and pensive expressions as they ride away indicate uncertainty as to whether they will repeat the mistakes of their parents.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortFilm">Short Film</a> <em>The Happiness Salesman</em> initially appears to have the clear cut ending of Karen rejecting the salesman's offer upon discovering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the payment was her first born child</span>, but after leaving The Salesman comes back to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">give her the free gift he promised &mdash; a steak knife. The music starts to become intense as Karen stares down at the knife while listening to her baby crying, implying that Karen may have changed her mind about the offer</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> ends with Cobb returning home to his children after a successful heist. Just to be sure, he spins his totem top one more time (certain objects could act as reality checks to help the owner tell if he was dreaming or not; for Cobb, if the top eventually falls over, he's in real life), but runs off to see his kids before it stops. The screen cuts to black before the audience knows as well, leaving it up in the air if Cobb is still dreaming or not. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Even though, according to most viewers, seeing as the top was his wife's totem, his wedding ring is his totem. If that theory can be trusted, then every time that he was wearing his ring, he was asleep (because in the dream world his projection of his wife was alive), and every time he wasn't he was awake. In the final scene, he isn't wearing it. Therefore, if this theory is true, then he was awake and with his children at the end of the film.</span> <br><br>However, the director, Christopher Nolan, has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/05/christopher-nolan-finally-explains-inceptions-ending">pointed out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the point of the scene was that Cobb cares more about seeing his children again than he does about determining whether it is a dream or reality: he is content with his current reality, whether it's "real" or not because he is reunited with his family. The ending was intended as a commentary on the ability of humans to shape their own reality with their choices and convictions. The ambiguity is intentional, and not the point of the scene, though debate concerning whether it was a dream or not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">came to dominate discussions about the film</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeforeSunrise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeforeSunrise">Before Sunrise</a></em>: The film ends with Jesse and Celine promising to meet again in six months, with no way of getting in contact before then. Not until the sequel (nine years later) do viewers find out what happened next: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they never made the meet</span>.
<ul><li> The two sequels also end on this note. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the second, they appear to get together, but with little idea how it will end given that they developed different lives in the aftermath of the first film. The third film is similarly ambiguous, though they are now married, it is less than perfect and it ends with them questioning whether they will stay together but leaning towards yes.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The end of 2011 British horror <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAwakening">The Awakening</a></em> leaves the viewer uncertain as to whether the heroine (Florence Cathcart) survived the poisoning attempt and is alive or whether she's a ghost who's haunting Robert. On one hand, many assumed she was dead because she walked past people without them even seeing her (even when she was very, very close) and in the background you can hear the headmaster talking about her as though she's dead ("Yes, she always <em>was</em> a bit strange, that Cathcart girl"). On the other hand, some thought her alive because she tells Robert she's working on a manuscript for a new book and asks him to get her a taxi back to London, which isn't an activity most ghosts engage in. The film's ending is purposefully contradictory to add suspense and unease.

After having been concerned about his job security throughout much of the film, Larry is informed he'll indeed make tenure. And while it's never specifically stated that Larry is reunited with his wife Judith (who had sought to divorce Larry and marry an older man until he died in a car crash), the two are seen smiling and holding hands at their son Danny's bar mitzvah, implying as much. Danny even manages to get his transistor radio back after having it taken away during Hebrew School. However just as the movie seems to take an upbeat turn, Larry receives a phone call from his doctor, telling him that the results from his physical are in and that he needs to see him in his office; while we are not told what the problem is, we can imply it is most likely a serious medical condition. The movie ends with Danny at Hebrew School when it's announced there is a tornado and the students must be evacuated for shelter. The last shot is Danny staring at the rapidly approaching tornado as the teacher struggles to open the door of the shelter.

The film takes place 60 years after the photograph was taken. No proper explanation has ever been given as to what the ending means.
<ul><li> One common interpretation is that Jack has been absorbed into the hotel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJacket">The Jacket</a></em> ends with the screen going black and the spoken question "How much time do we have?", leaving the audience wondering if the last scene was for real or not.
</li><li> The ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em> was so ambiguous, that it had not one, but two other versions that tried to make sense of the film. In the end, it only served to make it even more confusing.
</li><li> While the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GirlInterrupted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GirlInterrupted">Girl, Interrupted</a></em> is released, it's never explicitly stated if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Lisa</a> ever got out. Susanna claims that she saw some of the girls from the hospital later in life, but doesn't say which.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPsycho">American Psycho</a></em> ends with Patrick Bateman confessing his crimes to his lawyer, only for it all to be brushed off as a joke. It's left completely ambiguous whether Patrick was actually a murderer or just hallucinating violent imagery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EaglesGathered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EaglesGathered">Eagles Gathered</a></em> closes with Silver's death, but never makes it clear what actually happens when you die in the underworld, nor what happened to Gold: successfully rescued, dead, or never existed at all.

While it is known from the beginning that Summer and Tom don't make it, this still occurs with the final scene. When Tom is going for a new job interview, he meets Autumn and they have a pleasant first interaction. But there is nothing to suggest this relationship will be any better than the last.

Which Julie is the real one and which is the imaginary one? If the young one is real, was she with Sarah at the French house doing all those things? Or did Sarah just invent the crazy stuff? Alternatively, was Julie even there at all? Is Franck actually dead? Did he even ever come to the house?</span> Lots of questions, to be sure... these are just a few.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBreakUp">The Break-Up</a></em> ends with the titular couple meeting up on the street months after their break-up and exchanging pleasantries. It's left ambiguous if they will just go their separate ways or have another try at their relationship. An alternate deleted scene shows them meeting up with their new boy/girlfriends, who happen to look very similar to their exes, showing that they're not completely over one another.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alice1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alice1988">Alice</a></em>: The film ends much like how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a> did, with Alice waking up in her room from the dream. However, Alice notices that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the glass case that contained the White Rabbit is still broken and the Rabbit missing</span>. This makes it unclear if the dream is actually over or if she's still in Wonderland.
</li><li> The made-for-TV movie <em>Special Report: Journey to Mars</em> ends with the crew of the first manned mission to Mars overcoming the obstacles (mostly caused by a powerful corporation having a vested interest in the mission failing) and landing on the red planet. A crew member then exits the craft, starts saying her first words, then her eyes go wide, she utters "Oh my God...", and the transmission cuts off. The space agency sends a satellite in orbit to scan the area, followed by shots of the planet... and then credits. We're left to wonder what the astronauts encountered on Mars and whether they're alive at all.

<ul><li> The short story "The Lady or the Tiger," written in 1882 by Frank R.

The plot of the story is a no-win situation where someone faces a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>, and it is up to the reader to decide just which choice she made.

After disposing of his arch-nemesis Phil Leotardo, Tony is seen taking his wife Carmela and son AJ to a diner, later to be joined by their daughter Meadow. It's seemingly an upbeat scene, with the exception of Tony discussing potential legal troubles on the horizon. Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" starts playing in the background, and you begin to see curious shots of seemingly random persons in the diner mixed in with shots of Tony and his family happily chomping down on onion rings. Arguably the most curious is a man wearing a Members Only jacket sitting at the bar. The music swells, an unseen person enters the restaurant, Tony looks up, and suddenly&mdash;cut to black, series over. To this day, fans continue to argue whether this implied that Tony was suddenly shot as the screen cut to black (perhaps by the man in the Member's Only jacket?), or that it meant nothing at all&mdash;Tony and family continued to enjoy their food without interruption. While it's impossible to know for sure, there <em>are</em> a few small details that could be interpreted as hints that Tony dies. To elaborate:
<ul><li> The first episode of the final season is titled "Members Only", and its plot involves (among other things) Tony being mortally shot, and a man in a Members Only jacket killing someone in a diner. The man in the Members Only jacket (credited as "Members Only" in the final credits) may have been intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to that episode, hinting at the same thing happening.
</li><li> A few episodes before the finale, Bobby muses about what it's like to be shot to death, and theorizes that "You probably don't even hear it when it happens"&mdash;possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> an ending where Tony is shot to death, and never hears the gunshot.
</li><li> The last time that we see the mysterious man in the Members Only jacket, he's walking into the bathroom. This may have been intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the famous scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> where Michael Corleone shoots someone to death in a diner after retrieving a hidden gun from the bathroom.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1e8hc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1e8hc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1e8hc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Notably, A.J. mentions that very scene in another episode in the final season, noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">it's Tony's favorite movie scene of all time</a>&mdash;possibly making the final scene a deliberate case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">Death by Irony</a>.</span>
</li><li> After Tony is shot in "Members Only", he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventuresInComaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventuresInComaLand">falls into a coma</a>, ending in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToWhite">Fade to White</a> when he ultimately survives his brush with death and awakens. The abrupt cut to black may have been intended as an inversion of the earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToWhite">Fade to White</a>, indicating that he suffered <em>another</em> shooting that proved fatal.
</li><li> Several times during the final scene, the camera inexplicably cuts to Meadow struggling to park her car, resulting in her being late to dinner; the final shot of the series shows Tony looking up at the door as she finally arrives. If Tony is indeed shot to death in the final scene, this seemingly random detail would make his death considerably more tragic&mdash;since it would mean that Meadow arrived just in time to watch her father die, but too late to share a final moment with him.
</li></ul></li><li> In season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Forbrydelsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Forbrydelsen">Forbrydelsen</a></em>, the killer confesses to all the murders attributed to him except one, which he claims, without evidence, was committed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raben, telling the mentally ill man that he doesn't know of his own guilt because he blocked out the incident. Lund shoots the killer dead moments later</span>, and it's never revealed whether or not he was telling the truth.
</li><li> The two-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> ends somewhat ambiguously. After all his friends and family have gone on to start new chapters in their lives, the viewers are led to believe Frasier has accepted a new job in San Francisco, and assume the plane he is on (where he has been relating the story to a fellow passenger) is going there. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, the final scene shows it landing in Chicago, where Charlotte has moved. Frasier asks the other passenger to wish him luck, and the episode, along with the series, ends. Presumably, he wants to get back together with Charlotte, and it's up to the viewers to decide whether or not he's successful, and whether or not they live happily ever after.</span>
</li><li> The mini-series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Watchmen2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Watchmen2019">Watchmen (2019)</a></em> ends with protagonist Angela finding an egg that her husband, Cal/Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan (who'd just died) left her, with a voiceover of them talking about whether or not he can transfer his powers. He says that, theoretically, he could put his sub-atomic components into some sort of organic matter and if someone were to consume it, they could get his powers. She says that if she ate it she'd be able to "walk on water" and he says more thank likely, yes. She takes the egg, goes outside to the pool, takes her shoes off, cracks the egg, and consumes the contents. The final shot of the show is her foot hovering about an inch off the surface of the pool's water while a cover of "I am the Walrus" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> plays.

The Devil challenges Johnny to a fiddle-playing rematch. Johnny mentions that he's out of practice, since he's been focusing on fatherhood.

</li><li> "A Plague Of Lighthouse Keepers" by Van Der Graaf Generator is about a lighthouse keeper who is filled with guilt about all the shipwrecks he's seen over the years and been unable to prevent.

After having overcome trials that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> task him with, he gets his answer: She doesn't love Daniel anymore.

Theodor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">quickly gets obsessed with the case</a> and, convinced that it must be possible to save at least Stina's life, is soon contacted by the Fair Folk.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> has a lot of episodes that end with threats that do not get resolved on-screen. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, things are usually back to normal by the next episode. But the series finale "The Inquisition" ends with Rob falling into the void while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">Dark Reprise</a> of the theme song plays. Until we get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a>, we do not know what happens.
</li><li> Last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cybersix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cybersix">Cybersix</a></em> ends ambiguously. Cybersix was so close to the exit, did she make it? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is dead but Jose is shown to have survived and the very last shot is of Lucas wondering the streets, looking up and seeing light in Adrian/Cybersix's window. Since the show was cancelled so we will likely never know what happened.
</li><li> The "Unknown Mystery Killer" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em> ended with an intentional loose end. The killer - who had murdered Drew Barrymore, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jennifer Love Hewitt, having the gall to do it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">outside the Deathmatch ring</a></em> - simply called Nick and Johnny one last time to taunt them, but was never identified, saying Johnny catchphrase ("Good fight, good night") for him in an evil-sounding voice right before the credits rolled. (Of course, this was likely intentional.)
</li><li> The twist ending of Will Vinton's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClosedMondays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClosedMondays">Closed Mondays</a>". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Was the Drunken Man an ordinary person who was turned into a statue? Or, as it's heavily implied by his reaction to the plight of the Scrubbing Woman, was he originally a sculpture that managed to escape the gallery? And if he was a statue, was he trying to escape again as he stumbled for the door, or did he willingly go back to his plinth and become a statue again?</span>
</li><li> Justified in the "Atalanta" animation from the <em>Free to Be... You and Me</em> TV special (and book), since a main theme of the film was to challenge gender stereotypes. Rather than the hero and heroine getting married at the end, as in the original legend, they instead merely spent the afternoon together. They then went off <em>separately</em> to pursue their own desires: namely, travelling the world. The story concludes that they may or may not be married eventually. But,
<div class="indent"> "...it is certain that they are living happily ever after."
</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Tweek x Craig". The titular pair end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay">Mistaken for Gay</a> by the whole town due to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirls</a> making fanart of them. They fake a break-up which ends up making the whole town sad, so at the end they pretend to get back together for the town's sake. However, there are possible implications in the episode (as well as future material and from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>) that they might actually have feelings for each other for real.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> song "Hello Nurse" song brags about the nurse and all her spectacular achievements. At the end, Yakko and Wakko state that if what Wakko said in the song isn't true, then let "lightning strike us dead". Lightning strikes them afterwards, implying Wakko's boasting isn't accurate. However, it didn't kill them, so it could still be correct.
<ul><li> At least one fact is confirmed. In <em>Wakko's Wish</em>, Hello Nurse reveals she has an IQ of 192 (not 157 as the song claims).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> goes out on this note, with its final episode having both its main and side stories somewhat unresolved. But fans could care less about the B-plot concerning the mysterious, seemingly undefeatable monster. It's the question the A-plot raised of whether or not the school girl that Beast Boy has been talking to was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Terra</a> or not. Clues are sprinkled throughout the episode for either possibility, with additional clues for whether or not she's faking amnesia if she <em>is</em> actually Terra.
<ul><li> It was later addressed in Issue #51 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> comic<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27dtd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note27dtd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27dtd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the comic based on this show, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">the comic based on</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">sequel cartoon of the same name</a></span>, where the Titans encounter Geo-Force, Terra's older brother who's been searching for her whereabouts. Beast Boy takes him to the school, where he confirms that the girl is indeed Terra, with the ending also suggesting that Terra was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">faking her amnesia in order to live a normal life</a>. Fans debate whether the comics should be seen as canon, however.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>: The episode "Murder on the Planet Express" has the main characters go on a Corporate Trust Exercise led by a business consultant Dan McMasters. As part of the trust exercise, they pick up a seemingly random hitchhiker that turns out to be a murderous shapeshifter that eats the characters one by one. At the end of the episode, Dan McMasters claims to Fry and Bender that the whole situation with the shapeshifter <em>was</em> the trust exercise and no one really died, but Fry and Bender don't believe him (since the shapeshifter claimed the same thing earlier to get the drop on them) and promptly murder him, only for it to be revealed that he was telling the truth. Fry and Bender swear each other to secrecy, but a large reward is offered for the identity of Dan McMasters' killer (and in the case that there were two killers, double the reward and total immunity if one of the killers turns in the other), which prompts Fry and Bender to eye both each other and the phone before the episode ends. Since this show rarely has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">actual continuity</a>, it's never revealed if they ratted on each other or not.
