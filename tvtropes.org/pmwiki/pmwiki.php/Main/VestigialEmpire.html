<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, Ancient Belka was a powerful empire that spanned many dimensions, a mighty civilization that conquered every world that came its way with its superior magic and technology. However, infighting mixed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> and widespread pollution have destroyed the empire from the inside until it finally fell apart after the self-sacrifice of the last Saint King, Olivie Segbrecht. All that's left of the Belkan Empire in modern times is the Saint Church Autonomous Region in the Northern Mid-Childa, although the Saint Church focuses more on the religious than political power (their doctrine is based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Olivie as the messianic figure</a>) and preservation of the Ancient Belkan cultural and magical heritage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Setting a number of nuclear bombs off on themselves didn't help.</a>
</li><li> The Anglo-Saxon Kingdom in Britain during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em>, being constantly invaded by various Norsemen. Askeladd even discusses this with Thorfinn, bringing up the Roman Empire and all it's glory and advancement that led it ultimately into destruction, saying that it is the same now for the Kingdom of the British who contributed to the Roman downfall. Neatly enough, Thorfinn chucks away a Roman coin he picked up in the ruins (naturally Roman) they were standing in, since it was worthless to him.
</li><li> The Earth Federation from the Universal Century universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> is this, in a pattern that echoes Gibbon's <em>Decline and Fall</em>. The Federation won the One Year War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> through superior power and production capability, but at the cost of half of the world's population. Seven years later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> the Earth Federation has weakened to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">the remnants</a> of Zeon are still a serious threat, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> organization is intentionally sabotaging the Federation from within so that they can take over. Afterwards, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em>, even though Zeon has been defeated twice already, the Earth Federation is so weak that the Neo-Zeon nearly make the Earth uninhabitable and only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a miracle caused by Amuro's death stops it</span>. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Victory Gundam</a></em> (60 years after <em>CCA</em>), the Federation is so weak and ineffectual that it falls to a militia to oppose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>. Despite all of this, however, the Earth Federation is the eventual victor in each of these conflicts, if only through outlasting the various threats to its survival. If the live-action film <em>G-Saviour</em> is canon, then the Federation finally collapses around UC 200, when the Colonies finally achieve independence and form a new government together with the Earth, but this time with the Colonies (renamed "Settlements") as equal diplomatic partners. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Not that this new government is any better than the Federation ever was.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, the now dead countries of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, Rome, and Germania play this role, with Rome being the prominent one. He left two (idiotic) grandsons behind who are constantly being fought over because of their grandfather's inheritance, Germania is the father/grandfather of the Holy Roman Empire, Germany, and Prussia, and Ancient Greece and Egypt each left behind a son who spend a great deal of time discovering and researching the ruins of their mothers' kingdoms. Rome even comes back from heaven occasionally to check up on N. Italy and bother Germany. And if history's any indication, this may apply to Austria as well, who, as both the Austrian Empire and (one half) of Austria-Hungary, served as a remnant of the Holy Roman Empire.
</li><li> The Galactic Empire in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, as not only the government's influence is waning due the conflicts among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">High Nobles</a>, but a string of incompetent military commanders led to multiple defeats against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Free Planets Alliance</a>, that at one point would have been able to <em>march all the way to the Imperial capital</em> (the one thing that saved the Empire was the death of the Alliance admiral who inflicted that defeat, as his subordinates couldn't agree with each other long enough to do it and the Alliance government lacked the political will, giving the Empire time to rebuild their military and put a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon">gigantic space fortress</a> on the invasion route). By the time of the series, the Imperial government is so weakened that Reinhard von Lohengramm was able to wipe out the High Nobles and impose himself as the Prime Minister <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then become emperor</span>, at which point the Empire is reformed and enters a new golden age.
</li><li> The Beelzenian Empire in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles">Evillious Chronicles</a></em> franchise is an example of this as the centuries go on, losing larger and larger chunks of territory until it's only a shell of its old self. Before its decline it had also conquered pieces of the (offscreen) Tasan Empire, a second example of this trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> has revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the walls are in reality the last bastion of the once proud Eldian Empire, formed by Eldians led by the royal Fritz family. They settled on the island of Paradis as the Kingdom of Marley overthrew and exiled them</span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marley itself is slowly becoming this, as new weapon technology means that the Titan shifters they've relied on for so long are no longer as powerful against their enemies as they once were. However, in order to get the rest of the world on their side and retain their position of power, they've declared war on Paradis Island in the hopes of wiping out the Eldians once and for all so that they're free from the threat of being overthrown, as there's been a constant power struggle between Eldia and Marley for almost two thousand years</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Planet Trade Organization, Frieza's empire, has become one by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#145;F&#146;</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. At its peak, it controlled about 70% of the universe. After Freeza's and Cold's deaths, the empire lost most of its territories and Sorbet is barely holding the last pieces together when he decides to revive Frieza out of desperation. When the resurrected Frieza tries to get revenge on Goku, the last remnants of the army are wiped out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After the end of the Universe Survival saga, Frieza decides to rebuild his empire.</span>

In the 75th Century, the immortal Wildfire is the only surviving original Legionnaire. He has established a new Legion on the planet Rimbor which abides by the laws and customs of the United Planets. The former UP member states do not trust each other as a planet-sized cannon reappears to destroy a star every 100 years, which has the effect of blocking communication throughout the galaxy. Wildfire and a newly trained, highly efficient group of teenage Legionnaires are able to destroy the cannon when it appears 97 years ahead of schedule. As a result, communication is restored and the United Planets is re-established at Wildfire's urging. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legionnaires</a></em> Annual #3 reveals that the United Planets no longer exists in the 100th Century, suggesting that Wildfire's initiative was ultimately unsuccessful.

After Tacticus, the Empire declined. today its last remnants are the Shires, the hinterland immediately surrounding ankh-Morpork, and places like the Guano Islands - which in defiance of the usual expectations, actually fought a long and bitter War of <em>Dependence</em> to remain an Ankh-Morporkian colony as they saw their standard of living going right down if the Morporkians pulled out - and therefore didn't have to financially support them any more. Ankh-Morpork's empire also had the usual more conventional wars of Independence at its ending; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">Rimwards Howondaland</a> fought its, err, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar">Boor War</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Aceria</a> also took the opportunity to fight a war by twilight's last gleaming and the Dawn's early light. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">The other half of Aceria</a> remained broadly loyal, however and got its independence peacably.

</li><li> The Galactic Empire from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foundation">Foundation</a></em> novels turns into this over the course of the series, and the Roman parallels are many and explicit, including a Justinian-like reconquest that collapses in on itself. By the time of the Mule, the Empire controls only twenty agricultural worlds, having abandoned its original capital <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet">City Planet</a>, Trantor, after the Great Sack. When the story's protagonists visit Neotrantor, the new capital, the senile Emperor Dagobert IX is under the impression that the Empire is as strong as ever, treating the Foundation as just another world within the Anacreon Province of the Empire. Interestingly, his son has no memory of the old empire, and sees being the ruler of twenty worlds as being pretty impressive.
</li><li> A slightly odd example which nonetheless fits all the above criteria is the U.S. government in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash">Snow Crash</a></em>, although in this case the "cutthroat politics" are office politics between software engineers. Power, influence and respect all withered away, so they fill the void with bureaucracy.
</li><li> Similarly, the U.S. in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OctaviaButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OctaviaButler">Octavia Butler</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParableOfTheSower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParableOfTheSower">Parable</a></em> series looks a lot like this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gondor has been in decline for the past one and a half thousand years, with its throne vacant, its borderlands constantly threatened by invasion, its former capital reduced to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostCity">Ghost City</a>, and the White Tree (a quasi-religious symbol of the empire's health and favor with the <em>de facto</em> gods) dead. Its sister kingdom Arnor went through a centuries-long decline in the backstory until its last remnant, Arthedain, was overrun and destroyed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Witch-king of Angmar</a>, though its royal line survived in obscurity. This reinforces the parallelism with the ancient Roman empire: one part (Arnor = Western Roman Empire) has collapsed under attack, the other (Gondor = Byzantine Empire) subsists as a beacon of civilization built around a borderline impregnable city (Minas Tirith = Constantinople), but is shrinking and weakened by devious politics. In a bit of a subversion, the appendices cite that after the War of the Ring, Gondor grew back into power under King Elessar (Aragorn), a descendant of the kings of Arnor and Arthedain. An alliance with Rohan led by &Eacute;omer also sturdied the emerging Dominion of Men (including Arnor's old lands) as well. Where this re-emergence of power goes following Elessar's death at the end of the appendices' timeline, no one is certain.
</li><li> The Elves of Middle Earth also qualify, having been the dominant race of Middle Earth prior to the wars against the forces of darkness (Morgoth and later Sauron) and the rise of men resulted in them diminishing in both number and power. However, Middle Earth had been little more than an outpost for their civilization for most of their history; when their control slipped away they simply returned to the Undying Lands where the bulk of them had long lived.
</li><li> The Dwarves of Durin's Folk have a lesser example. They were never really a empire <em>per se</em>, but at their height they were a extremely prosperous kingdom containing two of Middle-Earth's grandest cities and trade routes: Khazad-Dum and Erebor. Over the history of Middle-Earth they fall one by one, with Khazad-Dum falling to the Balrog and Erebor to Smaug the Golden, leaving Durin's Folk as a wandering people bereft of influence and those two cities as grim reminders of their lost glory. However, in another subversion, the efforts of Thorin Oakenshield, D&aacute;in Ironfoot and Gimli ends up restoring Dur&iacute;n's Folk to their former glory over the course of <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.

<ul><li> The post-Endor Empire is like this, getting progressively more so as time passes. Various defeats actually led to factions led by formerly-Imperial warlords splintering off. Now and again it surges back somewhat, like under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire">Emperor Reborn</a>, but since the people behind these surges are inevitably killed, these are temporary. The one good thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Daala</a> did was to reunite the forces under the warlords; she promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">killed off</a> a good portion, but she did leave the still-united remains in the command of someone who knew their limits. By the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a> duology, <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Gilad_Pellaeon">the weary Supreme Commander<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> looks at the eight sectors and thousand systems they still command, the two hundred Imperial Star Destroyers, the "Preybird" class fighters they buy from he knows not where, and thinks about how the Empire once ruled a million systems, had twenty-five thousand Star Destroyers, and could afford more than one surviving major shipyard which couldn't keep up the demand for capital ships, let alone starfighters. He believes that the only way it can survive is for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeaceConference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeaceConference">make peace</a> with the New Republic. And he does. When, while pushing for the Moff Council to support his peace treaty, he's told that the Empire still has significant military power, Pellaeon's response is that they have <em>just enough</em> power for the New Republic to consider them worth destroying if peace is not achieved. Fittingly, this territory is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">the Imperial Remnant</a> by the rest of the Galaxy.
</li><li> A century or so afterwards, it's the republican government that replaced it (The Galactic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Federation</a> of Free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">Alliances</a>) that crumble and survive only as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Galactic Alliance Remnant</a>. <em>Star Wars</em> is cyclic about these things.

</li><li> Tolnedra from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Belgariad">Belgariad</a></em> (although most of the countries around it were never really under its political influence, they still <em>act</em> as if they controlled the whole continent once upon a time). They are a greater force for law and order in large portions of Arendia than the Arendians are, and the backstory details how they basically forced the other countries to create Sendaria at one point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>:
<ul><li> Ankh-Morpork is a rare example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> where main characters not only come from the corrupt and decadent city, but often spend the entire book there. Also notable in that while the actual empire is long gone, and the Patrician expresses distaste with recreating the idea ("We are <em>not</em> having another Ankh-Morpork empire; we've only just got over the last one"), the Pax Morporkia is still in effect in many places due to Ankh-Morpork's economic and cultural dominance, only now instead of 'Do not fight, or we will kill you' it is 'Do not fight, or we will call in your mortgages.' In this case, the closest historical parallel would probably be London.
</li><li> Another example from Discworld would be Djelibeybi, Pratchett's analogue to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> in <em>Pyramids</em>. They only control a tiny stretch of river by the events of the book, but it's stated that they used to control most of the continent before they sold it all to pay for pyramids. They still serve a vital role, since it means the two local powerhouse nations don't actually share a border and have an excuse not to go to war.

Stirling's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordsOfCreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordsOfCreation">In the Courts of the Crimson Kings</a></em>, the Tollamune emperors once ruled all of Mars.

Even the tiny city-state of Mayene claims to be ruled by a descendant of Artur Hawkwing's continent-spanning realm, and there were entire kingdoms swallowed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GardenOfEvil">the Blight</a> that were supposed to be very strong. Much of the depopulation since then could be attributed to people being killed/enslaved by raiding from the Blight. All of the major southern cities are indicated to be very large, as they have never been attacked and some (at the beginning of the series, at any rate) did not even believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnOrks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnOrks">Trollocs</a> existed.

<div class="indent"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBeforeTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBeforeTheEnd">The Thurian civilization was crumbling</a>; their armies were composed largely of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe">barbarian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">mercenaries</a>.</em>

</li><li> By Conan's time there are a few as well, such as Stygia (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> but filled with shadowy evil) and arguably Koth (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a>, but with less of the "powerful, disciplined legions" part and more of the "ludicrously decadent rulers" part).

</li><li> The Empire of Humanity gradually becomes this during the course of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Genome">Genome</a></em> trilogy, transforming from a strong star-faring empire to a weak shadow of its former self.
<ul><li> The Taii to an even greater extent. Once rulers of most of known space, they have been reduced to a few dozen worlds and are hopelessly behind the younger races which have arisen after the Taii Empire's collapse. Unlike the human example, the current state of the Taii is due to a devastating interstellar war fought against an equal galactic power. As the author maintains, such a conflict will inevitably result in the destruction of one of the powers and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> for the other, for it will have lost much in the war. The once-mighty moon-sized Taii battleships still patrol much of what used to be theirs. However, this is only because the current rulers of that space allow the Taii this small favor as a testament to their former glory. Those battleships are escorted by modern warships a tiny fraction of their size but which can blast the massive Taii relics with a single volley. The author uses this as a clear example of what will happen to humanity should they enter into a such a conflict with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">Czygu</a>, an equally strong empire.
<ul><li> Even moreso, if the human-Czygu war breaks out, the Emperor will be forced to lift the quarantine of Ebon, a world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">religious fanatics</a> who absolutely hate all aliens and have built up a massive war machine dedicated to eliminating all those who are not true children of God. This will cause all aliens to band together against the humans and result in mutual destruction of everyone involved. Anyone who remains will be a clear example of this trope.

It once controlled a sizable continent to the south but the centuries of war against their enemy led to the original empire fracturing into dozens of squabbling countries, each claiming legitimate rule to the whole empire. The army fighting in the north decided to just use the newly captured lands to found a new nation rather than deal with that.

On a map, Fjorden appears to be only a shadow of its once continent-spanning might, but it's far from in decline. Rather, its leaders recognized that attempting to <em>militarily</em> reconquer their old lands would be unfeasible, and so made an alliance with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">the Shu-Dereth</a> religion. The "new" Fjordell Empire fused its own political hierarchy with the Derethi religious hierarchy, and as a result it's actually far <em>more</em> powerful than it was in its heyday through the Derethi religious sphere of influence. Anyone who is politically aware in this world knows that Fjorden is <em>far</em> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> it appears as at first glance.
</li><li> The Romulan Star Empire of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> universe seems destined to become this in all realities - note that this was even the case before its destruction in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">the 2009 film</a>.

Praetor Tal'aura and Proconsul Tomalak <em>were</em> able to reunite most of them, as the Federation sought to maintain peace along the borders (the Klingons "helped" by making Remus a protectorate). Commander Donatra, however, declared the worlds and fleets loyal to her independent. Between losing territory to Donatra, uprisings on the outworlds, and the damage from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDestiny">Borg Invasion</a>, the Empire was less than half its former size. It was explicitly stated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekArticlesOfTheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekArticlesOfTheFederation">Star Trek: Articles of the Federation</a></em> that the Romulans were no longer a superpower.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekMirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekMirrorUniverse">Star Trek: Mirror Universe</a></em>, it happens sooner, after Romulus is destroyed early by a weapon of mass destruction.

Unlike most examples, the empire was not established out of a desire for expansion but instead to secure their borders against lawless brigands and organized raiders - and every time the new borders were stabilized, more cross-border raiders and brigands appeared, forcing the empire to expand to destroy them as well. Ternathia eventually withdrew from many of its outer territories when they became too expensive to maintain control of, turning them over to local governments in an orderly, controlled contraction of their borders.

The empire still exists on paper and the Prime (ruler) of the most powerful kingdom, Azir, still technically holds the title 'Emperor of the Makabaki'; the other kingdoms respect the emperor's authority and will, for tradition's sake, comply with imperial orders - but only so far as they consider those orders to be reasonable requests. It's explicitly noted that if the Prime really tried to throw his weight around and force the rest of the Makabaki kingdoms to do things they didn't want to, he'd very quickly find out just how ephemeral his authority <em>actually</em> is.

</li><li> The Nietzscheans have also fallen from grace since their heyday. The unified Nietzchean Empire that caused the downfall of the Commonwealth quickly splintered into warring clan-groups after the battle at Witchhead. While the Nietzscheans as a whole are the largest power bloc in the former Commonwealth and large clans like Drago-Kazov and Sabra-Jaguar are significant power players on the intergalactic scene in their own right, the clans spend more time fighting each other for resources and mating rights than doing anything else. The Nietzscheans are far too politically fractured to be any more than a shadow of their past glory, and even if they could find a leader to unite behind, they have still fallen far from the point where they could take on the Systems Commonwealth.

The only thing that kept them from overwhelming the League of Non-Aligned World was a lack of will, and when the Shadow War caused the expansionist factions to come into power they first <em>crushed</em> the Narn (with some help from the Shadows, but it's shown the Centauri did a large part of the work), and then started twelve wars at the same time and were <em>winning</em> (albeit precariously, and again with crucial&mdash;and ultimately pricey&mdash;support from the Shadows) when Londo managed to force a stop.

A few years before the start of the series all criminals in Harlan County were beholden to Bo Crowder who got a cut of every criminal enterprise in the area with the exception of the marijuana trade which was controlled by the Bennett clan. However, a Crowder cousin kidnapped and murdered the niece of the local sheriff and Bo refused to turn him over to the police. The sheriff cut a deal with the Miami Cartel who turned over the killer to him for vigilante justice. In return he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">framed the guilty party</a> and sent Bo away to prison on trumped up charges. Bo left his oldest son Bowman and trusted associate Arlo Givens in charge of his criminal operations.

When Boyd finally goes to prison, the Crowders have little influence over the crime in Harlan.

However, Mags Bennett, the family matriarch, and her oldest son Doyle plan on retiring and going legit. Dickie Bennett tries to take over the operations but he quickly messes things up and in the ensuring conflict all the Bennetts except Dickie end up dead. Dickie attempts a comeback but he fails again and ends up in prison. The conflict in the final season is kicked off when Avery Markham returns from exile and tries to take over the Bennett's old marijuana operation.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>'s exodus from NWA, maintaining tentative oversight of independent promotions across a mere six countries became a challenge.

<ul><li> The Imperium of Man has waxed and waned over the past ten thousand years, but is now unquestionably in a state of decline, so much so that scholars refer to the current era as the Time of Ending. Whole sectors are being lost to rebellion, alien depredations, or governmental negligence, and on every front the Imperium's enemies are closing in. The words most commonly used are "decaying" and "rotting," and fearful sages worry that it will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Rising Empire</a> such as the Tau that will ultimately inherit the galaxy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Which is not to say that Mankind plans on going down without a fight</a>.
</li><li> The Eldar don't have so much a Vestigal Empire as they do the bleached bones of one. Where they once ruled the entire galaxy unopposed and rearranged the cosmos at a whim, now they're reduced to a few spaceborne cities called Craftworlds, some primeval colonies on the galactic rim, and in the Dark Eldar's case a nightmare metropolis in the cancerous heart of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Portal Network</a>.

</li><li> The Necrons ruled the galaxy before the rise of the Eldar, and have emerged from stasis to find their domain overrun by primitive upstarts. Their technology, while arguably the most formidable in the setting, has not always weathered their 60 million year nap, they can't reproduce due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">Virtual Ghosts</a>, and many of the lords who have woken up have developed eccentricities due to a mechanical version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryonicsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryonicsFailure">Cryonics Failure</a>.

The Beast's Waagh, little more than an echo of what the Krorks once were, brought the Imperium to it's knees and had the technology to turn entire planetoids into "attack moons" equipped with Gravity-manipulating weapons that could tear flagships apart and shift entire mountains to crush opposing armies.

Even if their golden ages were millennia ago, these civilizations have held out for this long in one of the most ridiculously lethal settings ever imagined.

Worse yet, by the beginning of the campaign that introduces them they're being shaken by a civil war.
<ul><li> By the beginning of the sequel, humanity could be counted as this as well as they have been weakened by dragons they once hunted and brought under the control of the wizard Yaka (Who had previously ruled the Azracs) and his Tigran followers.

Persia's unique ability in <em>Civ V</em> is based around the "Golden Age" mechanic, in which a sufficiently happy population leads to a brief period of increased empire-wide income and production. In Persia's case it also gets a boost to military units' strength and speed, allowing it to quickly conquer new territory, but unless the player has timed things carefully, they run the risk of being left with a military incapable of defending the empire's new borders once the Golden Age ends. The "From Achaemenid to Safavid" achievement requires the player to earn five such Golden Ages in one game and refers to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Persians' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">somewhat mixed history with this trope</a>.

<ul><li> The Tevinter Imperium. The player may not visit it in the games yet, but it's a big part of the world's lore and history, and its ruins litter the game. Their decline was brought about by a congo line of disasters, starting with the emergence of Darkspawn following a failed attempt by Tevinter magisters to enter the fade and wrest control of the Golden City from the Maker (God, basically) himself. The darkspawn brought about the Blight, which raged for 200 years before finally ending, but the image of the mighty Imperium, thought invincible, weakened inspired a massive internal slave rebellion triggered by an immense barbarian invasion spearheaded by Andraste, who was a sort of fusion of Jesus and Joan of Arc who punted the Imperium right in the knockers and wrecked much of their power even as the were recovering from the Blight. Some centuries later, the Qunari showed up, settling in the northern islands, and started kicking everyone's collective asses across Thedas, including the Imperium's, until the combined forces of Thedas halted the Qunari invasions. The Imperium, rather than making an uneasy peace with the Qunari like the rest of Thedas, has been fighting a bloody and expensive and stalemated war with the Qunari ever since. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, though, Fenris claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tevinter's power is slowly returning. Since Tevinter is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire">Evil Empire</a> that relies on the worst of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>, this is a very bad thing.</span>
</li><li> The Orlesian Empire is also heading this way, with its capital having already devolved into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a> and its land being a fraction of what the original Empire possessed under Kordillius Drakon.

</li><li> The Dwarven kingdoms used to extend under the whole of Thedas, but were whittled down by the Darkspawn until only Orzammar is left as a power in the world. Even Orzammar seems is failing, however, as a combination of unceasing Darkspawn attacks, the Orzammar elite's refusal to abandon their crippling traditions while the world changes around them, and the fact that many of the best and brightest dwarves are now leaving Orzammar to make (generally successful) lives on the surface means that Orzammar will either have to adapt or collapse completely in the near future.

</li><li> In the aftermath of what comes to be known as "the Oblivion Crisis," Ocato manages to keep the Empire together for a time. However, he is assassinated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a>, a religious extremist sect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter">Altmer (High Elves)</a> who quickly reform the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a> of old, the ancient rival to the Empires of Cyrodiil. Ocato's assassination plunges the capital province of Cyrodiil into nearly a decade of civil war, which ends when the warlord Titus Mede seizes power and is crowned Emperor. Argonia/Black Marsh (home of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a>) secedes from the Empire under the leadership of the xenophobic An-Xileel party, followed shortly by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiit</a> of Elsweyr. Morrowind is then devastated when the Ministry of Truth, a rogue moon frozen in place in the distant past by one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">resumes its descent with its original momentum</a>.

Seeing the weakening of Morrowind, several of the Argonian tribes in Black Marsh, spurred on by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentProvocateur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentProvocateur">agent provocateurs</a> in cahoots with the Thalmor, decide to join each other in raising a great army and invade Morrowind, pillaging the province as revenge for the Dunmers' centuries long tradition of leading massive slaving raids into the Black Mash. After everything is said and done, the Dunmer, against all odds, manage to band together and eventually stop, then mostly repel the Argonian invasion (though the southern part of Morrowind remains under Argonian control), and restore order to Morrowind. But in the aftermath, many of the Dunmer feel betrayed and abandoned by the Empire, which was too busy with its own internal strife to lend them any real aid, and the already present resentment against the Empire boils over, and unable to take their anger out on the Empire itself, they instead target House Hlaalu, the Empire's biggest supporters amongst the Dunmer's great noble houses, which ends up getting stripped of their power and most of their holdings, and Morrowind effectively becomes an Imperial province in-name-only. The Aldmeri Dominion forcefully annexes Valenwood (home of the Bosmer (Wood Elves) and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">claims credit</a> for restoring Tamriel's moons (sacred to the Khajiit) to the sky after they mysteriously disappear, bringing them Elsweyr as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal">client state</a>. After seventy years, the Aldmeri Dominion invades the remains of the Empire in the Great War that ends in a bloody stalemate, in which the Empire is forced to cede the province of Hammerfell to the Thalmor and allow Thalmor agents to persecute worshipers of Talos, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">deified Emperor Tiber Septim</a>. The Redguards manage to drive the Thalmor out of Hammerfell, but remain independent afterward. And during all this chaos, the Breton-majority portion of Skyrim called the Reach briefly rebels from the rest of the province, but is quashed.
</li><li> All this to say, by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, the Third Empire of Tamriel is down to two functional provinces, with a third, Skyrim itself, wracked by a civil war (quietly encouraged by the Thalmor, who hopes to further weaken the Empire by exploiting its internal divisions) between loyalists and secessionists led by Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, who objects to the terms of the treaty that ended the Great War. The player can help him wrest control of all Skyrim, side with the Imperial Legion and execute him, or broker a ceasefire so everyone can deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">the dragons who have suddenly returned and are running amok</a>.

</li><li> At least as late as <em>Daggerfall</em> (there is no canonical evidence afterwards), the Altmer clan Direnni ruled over the Isle of Balfiera (a much smaller island than Solstheim, let alone Vvardenfell) in the Iliac Bay. At their height (during the First Era), they ruled over about a third of Tamriel's landmass as the Direnni Hegemony, but losses and overextension led to a gradual withdrawal and collapse. Given that this was over two millenia ago, the Dirennis don't really have any hang-ups about their former empire.

<ul><li> Back in <em>Override</em>, there are hints the Voinian Empire is in the early stages of this. The Empire is still a very powerful force, but despite a technological advantage and massive fleets, they were defeated by the United Earth in the Battle of Sol, and subsequently driven back to the pre-invasion frontier, with (unbeknownst to the UE until you make contact) a Voinian slave race, the Emalgha, managing to take advantage to overthrow the Voinian occupation and reclaim independence.

After the catastrophic collapse of the wormhole back to Earth, they were the first civilization to re-emerge from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeofComicBooks">the Dark Age</a>, re-discover space flight and conquer most of their neighbors. But after their catastrophic campaign against the mysterious Jove Empire, the Minmatar successfully seceded from the Empire, corruption became widespread, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">Ammatar Mandate</a> was revealed to be throughly infiltrated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> and the Minmatar returned with a vengeance. However, Empress Sarum has managed to stop the decline, so they're not down for the count yet.

</li><li> Player alliances, such as Band Of Brothers, that were at one point in control of vast tracts of the map, but due to internal issues, wars, etc, were eventually crushed to nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> has several, as befitting a post-apocalyptic franchise:
<ul><li> A recurring villain throughout the series is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">The</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">En</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica">cl</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">ave</a>, who consider themselves the sole and true heirs to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica">United States of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">America</a>, despite only hanging on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretGovernmentWarehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretGovernmentWarehouse">Navarro</a> and the Oil Rig in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> (which they lost), Raven Rock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> (which they lost), Mid-West holdings like Chicago (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">which they've</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">NOT lost</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">yet</a>).

</li><li> Another recurring faction has been hit with this as well. In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em>, the technology-hoarding Brotherhood of Steel used their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and advanced weaponry to dominate the wasteland. But a hundred and twenty years later, by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseNot">the world has rebuilt itself</a> enough that even raiders have access to laser weapons, and the Brotherhood simply doesn't have the numbers to fight the NCR over things like old solar power plants. As a result, most of their chapters out west have either been wiped out or are holed up in hidden fortresses, stagnating and slowly dying out. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">East Coast Brotherhood of Steel</a>, on the other hand, is thriving thanks to its more open recruitment system (and lack of any major competition), and has not only become the feudal overlords of the Capital Wasteland, but is beginning to expand into the Boston Commonwealth. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> the player can join them and help them secure control of the Commonwealth, or deal the Brotherhood a crushing blow from which they may not be able to recover.
</li><li> Caesar's Legion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> is an aggressive, militaristic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Rising Empire</a> with the manpower and the stones to take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">the New California Republic</a>. However, they are also running on momentum of conquest and expansion and vulnerable to quickly becoming this trope instead if they fail to seize control of the Mojave and its resources. You can set them up for this by assassinating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Caesar</a> and rallying other factions like the Boomers, the Brotherhood of Steel, and even the Enclave Remnants to aid the NCR in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamPlot">a key battle at Hoover Dam</a>. You can defeat Caesar's most dangerous general, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Lanius</a>, at the end of the battle, but even if you instead talk him into retreating, it's hinted that Lanius won't be able to hold the Legion together for much longer.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKingdom">Dollet Dukedom</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, analogous to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Post-WWI Imperialist states</a>.

</li><li> San d'Oria from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> was the game's original Vestigial Empire, wracked with internal strife but still fairly powerful. It now shares its former power among two other nations. Overshadowed by the Aht Urhgan empire, which fits this trope to a T. Political intrigue, encroaching hordes, you name it.
</li><li> The Lilty Empire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles">Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</a></em> once almost conquered the world, but eventually ran out of materials and shrank down to its Capital City. It seems to lack the political complexities, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though their princess <em>did</em> run off after being cooped up in the castle...</span>
</li><li> The Adrestian Empire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> is something of a downplayed example as it is still a militarily and economically powerful nation, but in the millennium or so of its existence it has gone from dominating all of F&oacute;dlan to being confined to the south after losing territory to the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. In the present day, the current Emperor Ionius IX is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllBoy">Ill Boy</a> and powerless figurehead on his deathbed while a cadre of nobles led by the Prime Minister Duke Aegir have all the real power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The "vestigial" part goes right out the window should the player take the Crimson Flower route as Byleth helps the new Emperor Edelgard reclaim all the Empire's lost territory in her quest to overthrow the Church of Seiros.</span>
</li><li> The empire of King Rhobar II in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic">Gothic</a></em> series is going down the toilet in the first game, near collapse in the second game, and pretty much ceases to exist as a political entity in the third and the add-on, though most of the people and geography are intact.
</li><li> The human race in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> has gone from ruling the entirety of the known world to barely holding onto one city and a small swathe of territory around it over the course of 250 years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>: After the onset of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">the Great Schism</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">the Covenant</a> breaks apart into hundreds of warring factions. As an ex-Covenant mercenary notes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HaloEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HaloEscalation">Halo: Escalation</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Zef 'Trahl:</strong> What does it mean to be 'Covenant' today? A hundred warlords claim they rule the Covenant, but each of them leads only a small faction.
</div><ul><li> In particular, the term '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">Covenant remnant</a>' is used to describe the various militant groups carrying the banner of the old Covenant who continue to war against both the UNSC and its newfound ex-Covenant allies. Jul 'Mdama's organization, which is encountered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>, is the most prominent of these remnants.
</li><li> We actually get a firsthand look at how the Covenant turned into this trope. We're shown that its government was an inbred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>, with command of the military split between various rival Ministries who spent as much time sabotaging each other as they did actually fighting their common enemies, and that the Covenant's dogmatic and hierarchical caste-based society resulted in a fairly stagnant culture and mutual distrust/distaste/hatred between their constituent species; decades before the Covenant's war with humanity began, the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">Unggoy Rebellion</a> had sent them into their 23rd aptly named 'Age of Doubt'. All this led to boiling tensions between the two most militarily-important constituent species (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Elites</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerSpaceMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerSpaceMonkey">Brutes</a>) and rising doubts about the validity of the Covenant's religion and leadership. This all came to a head when a UNSC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Spartan</a> assassinated the Prophet of Regret, a high-ranking member of the Covenant leadership whose death caused a <strong>massive</strong> uproar among the rest of the Court. In response to the perceived "failure" of the Elites to protect Regret, the Prophet of Truth attempted to genocide the Elites and triggered the very Great Schism that shattered the Covenant once and for all. Additionally, the Covenant's religiously-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">Creative Sterility</a> (they believed that <em>any</em> attempt to research or improve upon the technology of the Forerunners, whom they worshiped as gods, was an act of heresy worthy of the death sentence) allowed the UNSC to steadily narrow the technological gap during the war, putting the latter to be in a surprisingly good position to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Rising Empire</a> after the last vestiges of Covenant collapses, implied to be helped by the fact that Humanity were intended to be the ones to "inherit" the power and technology of the Forerunners anyways,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wlcv');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0wlcv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wlcv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And additional media all but confirms that the Covenant high command <em>knew</em> this, and their attempts to wipe out humanity rather than offer them membership into the Covenant was to <em>cover up</em> this little fact.</span> which essentially gave them a technological jumpstart.

<ul><li> The Taiidan Empire imploded spectacularly thanks to the events of the final mission of the first game, and by the beginning of the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion the new Taiidani Republic (officially recognised as the successor state) holds barely a quarter of its former territory. The rest have either broken off as independent polities or been absorbed into "bandit kingdoms" ruled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel">Former Regime Personnel</a> turned warlord, strong enough to launch an occasional raid against Hiigara, but by no means major players on the galactic arena anymore. Many of these factions claim to be "Imperial Loyalists" and the true successors to the Imperium, but with no clear line of succession and several competing voices insisting that <em>they</em> should be the one in charge their ambitious schemes to topple the Republic and bring back the good old days tend to bog down before getting far. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One of the larger and better-organised Imperialist factions gets desperate enough to try to harness <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldrichAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldrichAbomination">the Beast</a> to give them an edge; first they try to repurpose a sample of it as a bioweapon, but eventually they realise it's <em>sapient</em> and try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">forge an alliance.</a> This backfires rather spectacularly.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Homeworld 2</em>, the Taiidani remnant makes up a part of the Vaygr armada, poised to finally destroy Hiigara.
</li><li> The Hiigarans themselves can, possibly, be considered one, given that the old Hiigaran Empire was highly expansionist and was responsible for pissing off the Taiidani in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImperiumGalactica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImperiumGalactica">Imperium Galactica</a></em> game, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> is tasked with restoring the once-great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Galactic Empire</a>.

You are given the last of the <em>Leviathan</em>-class flagships (you can't build more of them) built during the heyday of the Empire, which outclasses any other flagship.
<ul><li> If the sequel is believed to take place in the same continuity, then the Empire is long gone by that point, having been replaced by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansByAnyOtherName">Solarian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Federation</a>. One of the subplots is a mad Emperor who had himself put into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">cryosleep</a> to wait for the time when he is needed again.

In the present they are limited to a small handful of camps outside of Gerudo Town, and their massive statues and buildings elsewhere are all but forgotten.

<ul><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita">Encyclopedia Exposita</a>, the <em>Batarian Hegemony</em> fits this trope perfectly. Balak even laments it in the <em>Bring Down the Sky</em> DLC, when he embarks on a passionate, long-winded rant to Commander Shepard. Balak blames Humanity and the Systems Alliance for the abysmal state of his people and uses his arguments as justification for slamming the asteroid X57 into a planet colonized by humans under Alliance control. This is a rather a-typical example in that the Hegemony was never all the impressive, but managed to lever its status as a Citadel member state into political power. As soon as they lost that status, the bubble collapsed.
<ul><li> It's even worse off in the third game. The Reapers began their invasion of the galaxy in Hegemony space, and the batarians got smashed so hard they didn't even know what hit them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They'd been secretly studying a derelict Reaper that had been captured decades earlier, all to gain a technological edge to fight the human Systems Alliance. In the process, all of their best scientists and most of the leadership were indoctrinated and opened the door wide open to the Reapers.</span> If he was spared in the above DLC, by the time Shepard meets up with Balak again, he is actually the highest ranking batarian military official left.
</li></ul></li><li> The Reapers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> threatened to turn a lot of the galaxy's civilizations into one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, the Protheans' chosen successors, the asari, most closely fit the bill after the fall of their homeworld Thessia.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Empire of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Naev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Naev">Naev</a></em> was decaying even <em>before</em> the Incident that destroyed Earth and most of the core worlds of the Empire, and even if it ironically solved an immediate and major threat to the Empire the Empire is still on an overall downward course.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PillarsOfEternity">Pillars of Eternity</a></em> has one or two known, depending on how you see it. The clearer example is the Aedyr Empire, which is still a powerful force but has contracted in the last two centuries, losing control of its transoceanic colonies in Dyrwood (where the first game takes place) and Readceras, and withdrawing from contesting commercial interests in the Deadfire (where the <em>second</em> game takes place). The other, more questionable example is Old Vailia, which not only has lost control of the old colonies of the Grand Empire of Vailia, but has also itself splintered into states that has engaged in a struggle for dominance for the last two centuries or so (several of which claim succession from the old Empire).

The Vasari in the game are the refugees from a single colony.
</li><li> The Romulan Star Empire under Empress Sela and the Tal Shiar's Colonel Hakeev starts out as this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>, having mostly coalesced together after Hobus destroyed Romulus but with the leading factions on the brink of falling out, their methods leading to increasing dissent and outright rebellion, and more than a few colonies still independently neutral or even leaning towards joining the Federation. Then a coalition of dissident factions sets up a rival government, the Romulan Republic, which rapidly gains support from various Romulan colonies as well as both the Federation and the Klingon Empire. The ensuing events are <em>not</em> kind to the Empire, and by the last time they're heard of, the best they manage to gather as an escort for their empress is a refitted freighter and a single mid-size warship (the Tal Shiar, having officially gone rogue, have more warships, but what's left of them are also in conflict with pretty much <em>everyone</em> and got fair bits of its leadership killed <em>twice</em> over the course of the game).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> Fallen Empires are the remnants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> who drew back to small isolationist enclaves. They're still powerful though, in one early multiplayer game every other faction in the galaxy ganged up on a Fallen Empire and the Fallen still managed to win. In later updates, Fallen Empires can actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink">"reawaken"</a> and start throwing their weight around and in the <em>Leviathans</em> DLC, actually fight each other (an event known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">War In Heaven</a>").
<ul><li> "Modern" Empires can break apart if not managed properly. Mismanaging factions could lead to several break away states forming from your territory, and wars that uses the Liberation War Goal would essentially push the victor's government ethics onto the worlds named under this goal, essentially creating a new nation from parts (or successor state, if you could do this to enough of the empire) that was friendly to the victor and much more willing to become its vassal than the parent empire.

All that's left are the armies squabbling over the ruins of a galaxy. (According to the intro and manual, that is. The core at least is implied to still have digital copies of many of it's civilians.) Notably, the expansion packs make it clear that after the war finally ended, the ARM managed to build itself up into a wonderful period of reconstruction. The most important elements for their war efforts, the Commanders and Gates, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that they can't build anymore.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarShogun2">Total War: Shogun 2</a></em>, the Ashikaga Shogun is the theoretical ruler of all Japan. In practice, the Ashikaga are a rump state holed up in Kyoto; the rest of Japan is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">warring states</a>.
</li><li> This is almost an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a> is a playable faction that starts off with a very well-developed capital and a powerful army list, but said capital is surrounded by the rising powers of Hungary, Venice, Novgorod, and the Turks, and its army cannot keep pace with the other factions' advances in the endgame. It's possible to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFallOfConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFallOfConstantinople">The Fall of Constantinople</a>, but doing so is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a>.
<ul><li> Historically-minded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">game mods</a> like <em>Stainless Steel</em> take this even further. In a Late Start (1220 AD) campaign, the Byzantines' holdings are scattered across western Greece and Anatolia, while their capital and Greek heartland are held by Crusader forces. Then there's the 1450 AD scenario seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/IAmSkantarios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/IAmSkantarios">I Am Skantarios</a></em>, in which the Byzantines have nothing but Constantinople, a fortress at Corinth, and a horde of Turks knocking at the door.
</li></ul></li><li> There are quite a few examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar">Empire: Total War</a></em>. The Mughals, who are the last spiritual remnant of the Mongol dynasty and have dominated the entire Indian subcontinent for centuries, are in a <em>really</em> bad way by the game's start in 1700. Their armies are hilariously outdated and very small, and their leadership is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">less-than-awe inspiring to say the least</a>. They exist pretty much to get subjected to a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp Battles</a> by the Marathas and/or the British. Portugal, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> back in <em>Medieval II</em> for its mighty armies bristling with cannons and matchlocks, is now a minor power with some small colonies but really not much clout, and Venice has been reduced to... well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity">Venice</a>. The worst case, though, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsHospitallers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKnightsHospitallers">Knights of St. John</a>, who now control the island of Malta and pretty much just take out the occasional Barbary warship.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarAttila" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarAttila">Total War: Attila</a></em>, the Western and Eastern halves of the Roman Empire play with the trope. <em>Territorially and militarily</em>, these are still the two mightiest powers in the world, and the Roman Empire still stretches from Britain to Egypt. However, Western Rome is a completely ungovernable mess on the verge of collapse, without enough military power to protect its own borders from the invading barbarian hordes, with Britain and Gaul on the edge of rebellion, and for the cherry on top, they're slowly losing the basic technology required to build their aqueducts and baths. Eastern Rome is not that much better-off; their land is smaller and richer, and their system is slightly less corrupt, but they're still staring down barbarian raiders and the fury of the Huns without enough legions to maintain their borders, and on their eastern border is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Sassanid Empire</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThirdAgeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThirdAgeTotalWar">Third Age: Total War</a></em>: Gondor. All of its former land east of Anduin starts off as rebel territory or controlled by Mordor, including East Osgiliath. Eriador is even worse off; that motley patchwork quilt of Breeland settlers, woodsmen, hobbits and wandering rangers is the last remnant of the Dunedain kingdom of Arnor (you <em>can</em> reverse Arnor's fortunes however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">in a big way at that</a>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> starts out only in control of the capital city of Altdorf. The rest of Reikland is controlled by secessionists, who are supported by Boris Todbringer of Middenland. Even when that situation is dealt with, you are still only in control of one of the eight provinces you nominally rule and even if the other Elector Counts aren't openly in defiance of you, it takes a fair amount of political and military maneuvering to take control of the lands you nominally ruled from square one. And that's saying nothing about how the wilderness is infested with Beastmen and the entire province of Sylvania (which was part of the Empire and still is nominally part of Stirland) is under the control of the Vampires, and both races want nothing but to tear down the world of men.
<ul><li> Similarly, the Dwarfs are politically shattered (not as badly as the Empire; Dwarfs don't do rebellion, but they aren't too keen about following your orders either), and several dwarfholds are overrun by Greenskins.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarThreeKingdoms">Total War: Three Kingdoms</a></em> opens just as the Han Dynasty has crossed the point of no return. Though nominally under the protection of the Emperor, said kid is a puppet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Dong Zhuo</a>. Any number of generals and warlords help themselves to its scattered, underdeveloped, and poorly-guarded provinces, leaving the last bastion of national unity picked clean by the mid-game.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dual Solar Empire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanGalaxy">Urban Galaxy</a></em> once had a monopoly over their most valuable resource, Carble, until the emperor's death. Then all of the corporations grabbed their rights over the resource, and a recession crippled the empire.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe is full of these.
<ul><li> In antiquity, the troll empires controlled most of the world until the night elves drove them back. The Sundering and conflicts with humans, high elves, and their own people eventually reduced them to borderline barbarism. Attempts by Zul'jin and the Zandalari have been made to convert them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of the Zandalari, while they style themselves as an Empire their domain has shrunk significantly since antiquity. The Sundering restricted them to the small continent of Zandalar, two thirds of which are only nominally under their control. The Empire has maintained its position as a world power thanks to treasures accumulated over millennia, one of the most powerful fleets on Azeroth, and the protection of several loa. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Alliance steals much of the treasure and destroys half the fleet while many of the loa are now dead, leaving Zandalar greatly weakened</span>.
</li><li> The Aqir created an underground empire that nearly crushed the troll empires until they united. The mantids, qiraji, and nerubians are their scattered colonies, each of which forged its own empire.
</li><li> The night elves dominated much of old Kalimdor until the War of the Ancients, and the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">Sundering</a>.
</li><li> Many of the human Seven Kingdoms. The Empire of Arathor played this trope straight, while the Kingdoms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Alterac</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Lordaeron</a> went a step or two further than this trope. The Kingdom of Azeroth (later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">renamed</a> Stormwind) played it straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftOrcsAndHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftOrcsAndHumans">Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</a></em>, only to invert it in the period between Tides of Darkness and Reign of Chaos, when it was rebuilt.
</li><li> The nerubians who are not part of the Scourge are a recent and extreme version. Aside from a splinter faction in the Great Seas, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowpedia.org/Kilix_the_Unraveler">Kilix the Unraveler<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and his small cadre of followers are the only known living Nerubians in the game. He speaks of rebuilding the old Nerubian empire while clearing Scourge from his people's fallen strongholds, but whether he has sufficient numbers to actually achieve that is unclear.
</li><li> The Arakkoa are descendants of the Apexis civilization, which once controlled much of Draenor before the Ogres came to power. A civil war in the distant past ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Fantastic Nuke</a> wiping out the majority of their population. The descendants of the survivors now live isolated on top of mountain peaks, relying heavily on creations of their ancestors.
</li><li> The Ogre Gorain Empire ruled the majority of Draenor at one point, dominating the other races through their massive physical strength and brute force magic more than political savvy. Their holdings have shrunk over time, especially after the arrival of the Draenei. The rise of the Horde is the effective end of their dominance on Draenor.

At one point B.J can overhear a conversation between two Nazi soldiers salvaging a destroyed battle robot, where one points out the inconsistency of their leaders going through the trouble of salvaging a destroyed robot when they should simply be able to build more with their boasted infinite resources and industrial might, leading to the soldier to darkly conclude that all is not well within the Reich. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinYoungblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinYoungblood">Wolfenstein: Youngblood</a></em> rolls around, the Third Reich has lost all of its territory outside of continental Europe.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em>, the only city we see undisputably under the control of the rump United States government is Boston.

It controls Guantanamo Bay, after a popular uprising against the mad and tyrannical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">Edward Butler</a> regime. It continues to exist because Butler was able to storm off with several nuclear ballistic missiles and most of America's gold reserves. Butler rules as eternal President, the people are under constant surveillance, children are indoctrinated to follow Butler's paranoid ideology, and the prisoners who were in Guantanamo Bay are treated as slaves.
</li><li> The Soviet Union-in-exile consists of lunar colonies and space stations that preserve the Soviet Union and reject capitalist Russia.
</li><li> The last remnant of the Qing Empire in the world of "The Last Emperor" rules Kowloon, where it becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> for criminal syndicates, deposed dictators, and espionage intrigue.
</li><li> The South African Republic-in-exile largely consists of the South African Defence Force, which is made up of a 40 ship-strong flotilla, taking shelter in the Portuguese exclave of Cabinda. Although recognized by the United Nations, the SADF's diplomatic and monetary lifeline that was extended to them by the international community lasted as long as the anarchy in South Africa did. The SADF resorted to becoming a global <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">private military contractor</a>. The Apartheid system is still alive in the former SAR, as the non-white populace is too small to vote themselves into power and an open rebellion would be suicide. The SADF are secretly determined to reclaim their old homeland, by any means necessary; they use their vast funds from their "humanitarian" operations to destabilise the South African successor states. Furthermore, they have undeclared nuclear weapons obtained from the former People's Republic of China and are planning to use them to wipe out the successor states.

<h3>Examples in this section are listed in (mostly) chronological order:</h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgyptianHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientEgyptianHistory">Ancient Egypt</a> provides two examples.
<ul><li> The First Intermediate Period (2181-2055 BCE) counts as a highly restricted example. After the collapse of the Old Kingdom, the regional lords&mdash;previously the Pharaoh's governors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36ctq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note36ctq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36ctq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In older books, these governors are often called "nomarchs," as the provinces were called <em>nomes</em>. However, this is based on Greek usage, which is understandable, as the Egyptian language was unknown to Western scholars until well into the 19th century (even after Champollion deciphered the Rosetta stone, the Ancient Egyptian language took decades to more-or-less-fully figure out&mdash;more or less, because there are <em>still</em> arguments, made more complicated by the fact that Ancient Egypt existed for <em>three thousand-plus years</em> and so changed a lot). On the other hand, the Greeks, with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish">collective hard-on for all things Egyptian</a>, had written down everything they could find out about Egypt in a language Western scholars could understand but translated the terminology.</span>&mdash;took complete control of the country, but for the first part of it (the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties) there was still a Pharaoh at Memphis. However, his power was completely nominal; at best, he might have had a religious role outside his relatively small domain around the once-great capital. (Records of the period are very sketchy, seeing as it was frickin' <em>four thousand years ago</em>&mdash;it was ancient history <em>to the Ancient Greeks</em>.) Eventually, the Memphite pharaohs collapsed, and the lords of Heraclitopolis in Lower Egypt (the Nile Delta in the north) and Thebes in Upper Egypt proclaimed themselves Pharaohs and fought for quite some time before the Theban Eleventh Dynasty conquered Lower Egypt and established the Middle Kingdom.
</li><li> Egypt during the Twentieth Dynasty and 3rd Intermediate Period. The country was united for most of this time, but it lost control of its empire in the Levant to various independent kingdoms (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Israel</a> being the most famous), its western territories to local raiders and Greek and Phoenician settlers, and Nubia to the Nubians, who would occasionally conquer Egypt itself for good measure. When it wasn't being ruled by Nubians&mdash;and particularly in the Twentieth Dynasty&mdash;however, Egypt was very much an ex-empire in splendid isolation, cut off from the affairs of the outside world.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">The Eastern Zhou Dynasty</a> ended up like this. After the capital was moved, the central government gradually collapsed, as regional lords began to assert their independence from the Zhou monarch and his officials. This decay started at the edges, but within two hundred years, the king had lost all his authority outside his relatively small personal domain.
<ul><li> The entire history of China has been zigzagging this, alternating between world-spanning empires and domestic collapses. See below for more details.
</li></ul></li><li> Iran's history is interesting. Achaemenid Persia was once a world-spanning empire, encompassing most of the civilized world and featured in the annals of most others. Alexander knocked it out while they were still at their peak. After a while under the Seleucid Greeks, the Parthians established an Iranian empire that while it was constantly at pains to maintain its western border against the Greeks and later the Romans, managed to establish a firm hold on Central Asia and the Persian Gulf that the Achaemenids never managed; this is even truer of the Sassanids, who very nearly rebuilt the empire as it was in the time of Darius under Khosrau II, when the tide of the war turned in favor of Byzantium... just as the Muslim Arabs knocked the whole empire out in one fell swoop. After that, Persia would spend a lot of time being either a province of someone else's empire (the Caliphate, the Mongols, and <em>an ever-rotating cast of Turks</em>) or divided among squabbling warlords (often Turks); there would be one more great Persian empire (the Safavids), with subsequent dynasties leaving something distinctly to be desired.
</li><li> Alexander the Great's empire stretched from modern Macedonia and the Balkans to modern day Iran and Afghanistan. It started with him and barely outlived him, but it left behind quite a few successor states in Egypt, Persia, Greece and as far as India.
<ul><li> Many of the aforementioned kingdoms became this themselves, notably the Ptolemaic empire (who went from ruling practically half of the Eastern Mediterranean to barely maintaining a hold on Egypt) and especially the Seleucids (who, at their peak, controlled all lands from actual Turkey and Syria to the border of actual India, and ended their dynasty as the ruler of a handful of cities in Syria taking orders from the Romans).
</li></ul></li><li> The Western Roman Empire and its ever-decreasing territory during the 5th century is a rather good example. By 395, its last partition with the Eastern Roman Empire, the West included Britannia (Wales, England), Gallia (Gaul: France and certain areas of the Low Countries), Hispania (Spain, Portugal), Italia (Italy), Dalmatia (Croatia), Mauretania Tingitana (Morocco), Mauritania Caesariensis (western Algeria), and Africa province (eastern Algeria, Tunisia, Libya). Imperial troops left Britannia between 407 and 410, leaving the Romano-British to fend for themselves against invasions. Gallia and Hispania were increasingly settled by Germanic populations from c. 412 onwards. While often allied or even subordinate to the Romans, they set up regional kingdoms and eventually become fully independent. The last Roman governor in Gaul, Syagrius, fell to the Franks in 487. Most of the North African areas fell to the Vandals between 429 and 439. The Vandals use their new ports to replace the Romans as the chief naval power of the Mediterranean Sea. Italia fell to its own Germanic mercenaries in 476. Dalmatia followed it in 480. By the end of the century what was left of Roman rule in the west was an independent but isolated Mauretania Tingitana. Eventually Belisarius took it back for the East, but then the Arabs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">came along</a>...
</li><li> The so-called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the Roman Empire's eastern half, centred around Constantinople/Byzantion, lingered for just under a thousand years after the better known fall of the western half. It spent most of that time gradually losing territory, power and influence, though it also had several resurgences &mdash; one under Justinian and Belisarius, one under the Macedonian dynasty, and one under the Komnenoi emperors. It spent the last century or so of its existence as a few disconnected regions and cities around the southern Balkans, until the Ottoman Turks put it out of its misery in 1453; technically, though most forget it, the last vestiges of Roman power were not Byzantium, but the small Empire of Trebizond, which did not fall until 1461, and the Despotate of Epirus, which survived until 1479. And then you had the fact that as soon as Constantinople fell, Ivan III of Russia immediately emphasised Moscow's position as 'the Third Rome' (Constantinople having been second), something helped by the fact that his wife was the niece of the last Byzantine Emperor, and then he and his successors spent the next 460 years trying to get hold of Constantinople (and on occasion, coming very close to succeeding) until the Russian Revolution of 1917. This example is probably closer to fictional portrayals than most others on this list, in that for a long time Constantinople's wealth and glory lingered (and both were often used, along with a ruthless grasp of <em>realpolitik</em> to either court new allies or divide and conquer), even if they could never recover the direct political or military power of the old empire. In fact Basil II 'the Bulgar Slayer', who ruled in the late 10th and early 11th century, is believed by some estimates to have been worth almost 170 <em>billion</em> in modern US dollars, placing him among the top ten richest men to have ever lived. That last century or two, however, it was simply a shadow of its former self, barely holding on - though some scholars have argued that if they'd played their cards a little better in dealing with the Ottomans, they might well have succeeded in resurrecting themselves again.
</li><li> The Byzantine Empire was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> making this perhaps the most spectacular example in history. And then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> retreated to ANOTHER Vestigial Empire in the form of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Nicaea">Empire of Nicaea<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (1204-1261), which was formed by refugees of the Imperial court and aristocracy after Crusaders occupied Constantinople. It managed to reconquer its old capital after more than half a century. The restored empire then had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">yet another vestigial empire</a> in Trebizond, above.
<ul><li> Bear in mind that it's hard to call Byzantine decline terminal before the Sack of Constantinople in 1204, since all empires fluctuate in power to some extent, especially on their frontiers. Indeed, it has been argued that were it not for the unexpected rise of the Ottomans to power following the collapse of the Seljuk Empire, the Byzantines might once again have played their usual game of divide and conquer and come back from the brink once more. They were kind of good at it.
</li></ul></li><li> Brunei once had an empire throughout most of Borneo Island and other islands, like parts of the Phillipines, as well. It is now a small enclave surrounded by Malaysia in Borneo. Made more jarring because Borneo is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">named as such because of Brunei</a>. The nation's substantial oil wealth helps cushion the blow, though.
</li><li> The 12th century Fatimids and post-11th century Abbasids are also good examples of this trope. The former went from a vast empire that spanned from northern Morocco to Syria to a rump state that was restricted to Egypt in about a century, while the latter went from dominating most of the Muslim world during the late 9th century to a remnant that had no real power outside central and southern Mesopotamia in about two centuries.
<ul><li> The Caliphates in general. The Rashidun Caliphate expanded from the city of Mecca to swallow up all of Arabia, North Africa, the Middle-East and Persia, before it was internally dismantled by the Umayyads. The Umayyad Caliphate was one of the largest contiguous empires in history, spanning from Persia to Spain. It was then overthrown by the aforementioned Abbasid dynasty, and the Umayyad dynasty fled to Spain and established a new Caliphate at Cordoba, which later disintegrated into warring factions which were all annexed by Portugal and the Spanish kingdoms following the Reconquista.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mongol Empire. Under Genghis Khan, it conquered many well-developed societies until it stretched all across Asia, from the Caspian to China. It was by far the largest empire the world had ever seen, and no empire since&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">save one</a>&mdash;has ever matched it. Now, it's right back where it was before Genghis Khan came along: a swathe of desert, and a bunch of nomads. It has the lowest population density (people per square mile) of any country in the world.
<ul><li> This is also one of the quicker examples of this trope happening; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>'s empire barely lasted 12 years after his death. Upon the death of &Ouml;gedei Khan without a clear heir, a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> split the empire into a succession of khanates (and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">Yuan dynasty</a>) that increasingly went native. The last khanates (which at that point were mainly Turkic) fell to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Russia</a> in the mid-19th century.
</li></ul></li><li> The Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee (The Longhouse Builders), a league of nations formed somewhere between 1450 and 1600, whose last remnants were swept up in the United States and Canada in the 20th century. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note424oo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note424oo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note424oo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A few historians even argue for dates as early as 1142 based on astronomical details in oral tradition, though this is not widely accepted. The earliest records of them acting as a state with regards to European powers dates to 1643.</span> Early on, the leadership of each of the six nations was determined by the highest-ranking woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other (primarily female) tribal members. Later on they became a loose democracy, with popularly elected tribal representation on the governing committee and widely distributed local decision-making, where decisions were arrived at by consensus of local men and women. They reached their height in the late 1600s, when they controlled most of the region east and south of the Great Lakes, though most of their claimed territory was sparsely settled at best, and contained more French colonists than Iroquois (which lead to a war when the Iroquois "ceded" much of this land to the British in 1701). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">American Revolution</a> split the Iroquois - four of the six nations sided with the British, while two sided with the colonists. After the war, the British ceded Iroquois land to the US without consulting the locals, resulting in many Iroquois hostile to the colonists fleeing to Canada, and the remaining land in the United States being very sparsely populated. Eventually, the Iroquois were limited to limited reservation lands in the US and Canada. In the 20th century the Iroquois formally became part of the United States and Canada and gained citizenship in the respective countries; while they retained nominal sovereignty over limited reservation land, the Iroquois are subject to most national laws and are now considered to be part of those countries rather than independent states.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SengokuJidai">Sengoku Jidai</a> came about due to the decline of the Ashikaga Shogunate. In this case, the decline of the Shogunate's power was not a result of Japan as a whole weakening, but of the growth of trade and wealth in the peripheral regions of Japan, and the resulting growth of power in the hands of local daimyo at the expense of the central administration. Eventually, things boiled over to the point where the capital at Kyoto itself became a battleground for warring daimyo, and this kicked off over a century of strife before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> put the Ashikaga out of their misery. It took a few more decades of war before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ToyotomiHideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> put Japan back together, though he could not prevent his death from causing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>.
</li><li> The Mughal Empire, before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">British East India Company</a> put it out of its misery in 1858. The Mughals are the most recent example, but India is scattered with ruins of long-dead empires, like the Gupta Empire, the Vijayanagara Empire, and the Maratha Empire.
<ul><li> To detail on the (chronologically) last part: the Mughal Empire started out as the remnant of an empire rising up from the ashes of the Mongol Empire (thus being the <em>vestigial empire of a vestigial empire</em>), until they overran the Delhi Sultanate and replaced it. From there, they expanded and took over most of India, taking advantage of the Vijayanagara Empire, its only possible rival, entering the state of Vestigial Empire after a fluke defeat against the Deccan Sultanates, until the rise of the Maratha Empire made their authority nominal. <br>From then on, Mughal authority was mostly nominal, with the real power residing in the hereditary governors of the Mughal territories, formally vassal kings and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">various East India companies of the European nations</a> (among which the British one was the one who ended up triumphing), with the Maratha themselves becoming a Vestigial Empire and a confederation formed by five mostly independent kingdoms (that would end up being absorbed by the Madras Presidency of the British East India Company), until emperor Bahadur Shah II, partly hoping to restore actual Mughal power, supported the Mutiny of 1857 (started as a mutiny in the Bengal Army of the Company's army due <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the Company supporting religious and secular offences to the local culture and land grabbings</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert">ignoring the European officers' and noncoms warnings that the troops were getting enraged</a>, and then becoming a full-blown war against multiple Indian states) and was proclaimed Emperor of India. When the British won, the second thing the Raj that replaced the Company rule did was to depose him (the first being eliminating the causes of the rebellion), with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> being proclaimed Empress of India a few years later.
</li></ul></li><li> 19th and 20th century Spain fits this trope to a tee: losing its empire and all pretensions of world power status, sinking into a deep economic decline, dominated by an over-powerful nobility, racked by constant political instability, coups, and the occasional civil war. Attempts to lord over its former South American colonies led Spain to get its ass kicked by them in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChinchaIslandsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChinchaIslandsWar">The Chincha Islands War</a>. Lingering imperial delusions and hubris were finally shattered in 1898, when they were quickly and brutally defeated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar">Spanish-American War</a> (mind you, the American armed forces were viewed as a joke in 1898, making this especially humiliating), but not much changed after that.
<ul><li> Spain annexed Spanish Morocco (mostly present-day Western Sahara and coastal territory around Tangier) in 1912, hoping to recover their international prestige. Instead they almost immediately fell afoul of hostile Riffian tribes. From 1921 to 1926 they fought a bloody guerilla conflict with Abd el-Krim's forces, winning only after France intervened. This sliver of mountainous desert remained Spain's marginal claim to world power status until 1956.
</li></ul></li><li> Portugal, similarly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a>, albeit symbolically, in its national anthem. Translated: "Heroes of the sea, noble people, valiant, immortal nation, <em>raise, today, once again, Portugal's splendor</em>!".
<ul><li> For some 20 years after they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile">fled in fear of Napoleon</a>, the seat of the Portuguese monarchy and capital of the Empire was Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, making Brazil a "united kingdom" (of Brazil, Portugal and the Algarves) and also making Brazil the only former colony to ever become the capital of the empire it belonged to. Later on, Brazil was one of the few colonies to gain independence peacefully. (And by "peacefully" we mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">"after about two years of irregular warfare with only a few dozen thousand battle deaths."</a> That this was actually considered peaceful says something about the wars of independence in the surrounding Spanish colonies). This was why Brazil was an empire in its first half-century of independence, and probably would still be had it not been for some rich aristocrats declaring staging a coup and declaring a republic to protect their rights against the leveling Imperial family (Princess Isabel, daughter of D. Peter II, signed the Lex Aurea in 1888, outlawing slavery).
</li></ul></li><li> The Ottoman Empire deserves a mention. It was suffering from one thing to another; from its defeat by the hands of the Greeks in 1832 with their war of Independence, to the fact that they fell behind in the Industrial Revolution in the same period. It has gotten to the point that it became so far gone by the 19th century that Russian Tsar Nicholas I coined the term "sick man of Europe" to describe it, and further noted that it was "falling to pieces." Subverted when the Turks wised up and became strong again during the mid-19th century... only to horribly lose the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War and enter a terminal decline as modernization efforts proved to be for nought in the interim. Then the 1910s hit, and the empire lost Libya to Italy and most of their remaining European territory to the Balkan States, then lost everything else to the British and Russians in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and now Turkey only has Anatolia and Eastern Thrace left (and barely at that: all of Eastern Thrace and most of Anatolia were to be ceded or put under foreign influence, and were only recovered when the Turkish National Movement based in Ankara overthrew the emperor and won the War of Turkish Independence against primarily the Greeks, forcing a new treaty). At least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFounder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFounder">Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk</a> managed to make the best of the situation by <em>finally</em> modernizing the country, and they still have Constantinople, so the situation isn't completely bleak.
</li><li> Andorra is the last surviving remnant of the Marca Hispanica, a series of border states created by Charlemange as a buffer between the Carolingian Empire and the Moors. It is now represented by Andorra, a delightful little enclave between France and Spain, and the 191st country in the world by area, with a total land area of only 181 square miles and a population of 85,000.
</li><li> The Principality of Liechtenstein may not seem much today, but it is arguably the last remaining piece of the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. It probably helped that the ruling family possessed considerable land and clout to retain their power even after Napoleon signed its death warrant. And surprisingly enough, prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> the Principality was somewhat <em>larger,</em> having included properties scattered across Austria-Hungary.
<ul><li> Andorra identifies itself with the Holy Roman Empire as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic">Austria under the Habsburgs</a> once held hegemony over pretty much all of Central and Eastern Europe, especially during the 16th-17th Century. But by 1914, the Dual Monarchy had long become (perhaps not <em>fully</em> justifiably) the basis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a> for much of Europe. The next decades would see the country dismembered, absorbed into Germany, and ultimately reduced to only a fraction of its former territory. Indeed, given their shared history, much of that could be said of Hungary, which after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> had to cede territory to every neighboring country; a quick look at the complete lyrics of the latter's national anthem ought to give it away.
<ul><li> If you look closely as the Hungarian anthem, the <em>Himnusz</em>, it's actually a surprisingly solemn hymn lamenting their lost achievements and calling on God Himself to pity their fallen glory.

</li></ul></li><li> Where Britain once ruled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">a quarter of the world</a> and had a massive Blue Water fleet explicitly designed to take on the next two largest navies in the world at once and <em>win</em>, she now maintains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gibraltar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandIslands">The Falkland Islands</a>, some delightful rocks in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, some rather more windswept rocks in the Atlantic, and the headquarters of the Commonwealth, which is about as loose an organisation as it gets. One wonders if JMS had it in mind when writing Londo's dialogue quoted on this page. One notable legacy of the British Empire that is near-inescapable is English, the international lingua franca of business, science, technology and aviation. The UK, however, downplays this to the extent that, despite its dramatic territory loss, it still wields a disproportionate amount of influence and power. The UK is still a member of the G8, the 8 richest nations on the planet, retains its permanent seat in the UN Security Council, meaning it could theoretically (although this is highly unlikely) veto motions issued by such powers as the USA and the PRC. Through its membership of the Security Council, its position as current head of the Commonwealth and its various other ties with former colonies, British influence extends to a majority of the Anglosphere. The defeat of Argentina in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar">The Falklands War</a>, accurately dubbed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">"The Empire Strikes Back"</a>, went a long way to show that the UK had not lost its status as a major power, as arguably, did involvement in the Gulf War, the Iraq War and Afghanistan (though the latter two are generally taken as examples of Prime Minister Blair's hubris and Britain's reach exceeding its grasp). This is probably best shown in the high Euroscepticism and general mild jingoism in Britain - it may have lost its Empire, but significant parts of it haven't quite realised it yet. Inner London is a monument to this - all manner of grand Victorian palaces and state buildings fit for an Empire that dominated the world now inhabiting the capital of a country that, on a good day, vies with Russia and France for the tag of 'best of the rest' after the US and the PRC.
<ul><li> There are some people who feel that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">HM The Queen</a> is <em>the</em> last remnant of Britian's imperial past, not the monarchy itself, but her <em>personally</em>, and not for nothing. She was born during the final boom of the British Empire, during the reign of her grandfather George V, lived through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, and her 60+ years on the throne has overseen the transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth, which observers have opined to be very much a creature of her own making. Even her coronation has come to be regarded not as the dawn of the new Elizabethan age as it was at the time, but the swan song of Britain's Imperial Splendour. There are also observers that say republican movements of all stripes will have no success "as long as she is alive", similar to how observers said there weren't any major changes coming to Austria-Hungary as long as Franz Joseph lived. And that proved (semi) accurate as Franz Joseph who had ascended to the throne in 1848 died in 1916 with empire dissolving little over two years later. However, WW1 arguably was a more important cause of those changes than Franz Joseph's death.
</li></ul></li><li> The French also downplays this to a degree like the British do, and many of the same traits apply to it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NATO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NATO">NATO</a> member, permanent seat in the UN Security Council, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUltimateResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUltimateResistance">nuclear weapons capability</a>, fourth-largest military and fifth-largest economy. They remain a powerful force in the world and in Europe and Western Africa in particular, both by themselves and through their influence with the EU. That, and they still have a number of larger overseas territories around. Not bad for a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys</a>.
<ul><li> Unlike what is commonly believed, the expression "lingua franca" is <em>not</em> however a vestige of France's former power and influence. It actually means "language of the <em>Franks</em>" (not the French), and arose as a result of the medieval Arabic use of "Franks" to denote <em>any and all</em> Western Europeans (or the Western Christians/Catholics, since at the time there wasn't any distinction between the two).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5f4d2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5f4d2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5f4d2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Eastern Christians were another story; Muslim Arabs were quite familiar with them, seeing as they tended to literally live next door, as Christian Arabs.</span> Not at all surprising considering the Franks and the subsequent empire they founded under Charlemagne essentially re-established political order in a Europe that hadn't seen any since the fall of the Roman Empire, and one that would later evolve into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. The original Renaissance-era lingua franca (Mediterranenan Lingua Franca) consisted largely of <em>Italian</em>, with a vocabulary that also incorporated many words and phrases from Turkish, French, Spanish, Greek, and Arabic. That said, French was the <em>lingua franca</em> for a long time, with the children of well-to-do families from Russia to the US being expected to speak French well into the 19th century, before English subsumed it.
</li><li> Charlemagne's empire itself also provides an example. It was the first large political structure in Europe following the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Yet, within a generation of Charlemagne's death, it was reduced to near impotence to the point where French kings had to buy off Viking raiders with grants of land and titles.
</li></ul></li><li> Germany, as with Britain and France, also downplays this. The German Empire until World War I was small and compact, but was highly organized and had one of the best-trained armies in Europe. After the war, Germany was forced to give up its African and Pacific territories and much of the land it had won from Russia, giving the rest to Poland. With the start of World War II, Germany captured Poland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Northern France, and much of the Western USSR in just two years, before being defeated and had many of its cities levelled. Today, Germany has a fraction of the territory it held at its height, but is highly influential and a leading member of the European Union, and though it's not a permanent member of the UN Security Council, it is listened to and respected as much as Britain and France (possibly more than Britain these days) remains an economic powerhouse in Europe and the somewhat reluctant leader of the EU.
</li><li> It's hard to believe today, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Armenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Armenia">Armenia</a> used to be a powerful regional player in the Middle East and West Asia. Oh, and it was <em>much</em> larger than it is today; during the reign of Tigran the Great in the 1st century BCE, it spanned from Lake Sevan in the northeast to Tyre in Lebanon, bordering both the Caspian and Mediterranean Seas. Although it was rarely completely independent, Armenians used to be one of the biggest ethnic groups in West Asia as well, with vast swathes of eastern Turkey having major Armenian populations. Then the genocide happened, which wiped out virtually all Western Armenians (who constituted more than half of all Armenians at that time, so it's a huge loss, to say the least), followed by the one-two punch of the Armenian SSR being forced by the Soviet Union, which re-conquered it after two years of independence, to cede a quarter of its land to Turkey and another quarter to the Azerbaijan SSR as part of a peace treaty, which of course meant that Armenians in those lands had to leave (though the folks at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RepublicOfArtsakh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RepublicOfArtsakh">Republic of Artsakh</a> eventually managed to fight back). The remaining territory (estimated to be 3% of Tigran's Armenia) declared independence in 1991 as a poor, Russian-depended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a>, a far cry from its proud conquering ancestor.

</li><li> In the early twentieth-century, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> was the dominant great power of the Pacific thanks to its rapid industrialization in the late nineteenth-century, holding its original islands, Korea, parts of Manchuria, and many islands in the Pacific (including Taiwan). It shocked the "civilised" Western nations by defeating the eastern Russian navy in 1904-5, and had plans to expand into China and Oceania during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a>. Before it took pretty a significant portion of East Asia during World War 2 before being defeated, they also had significant influence in the area due to their powerful navy, leading interventions into China and Siberia, and annexing all of Manchuria before World War 2. Now, thanks to their defeat during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and their subsequent occupation by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates">The United States</a>, Japan consists almost entirely of just its original islands, and its military has been constitutionally neutered.
<ul><li> Again, downplayed as well, considering that they re-emerged as an economic powerhouse - rivaling that of Germany (or depending on how you see it, and when it was, even the US) - and a major exporter of pop culture and technologies, particularly cars and consumer electronics like televisions (hence the catchphrase "Made in Japan", particularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>); for several decades in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries the largest car company in the world was Japan based. Economically, Japan was far <em>more</em> powerful during and after the Cold War than it was before. For a good deal of 1950-2000, it was the one of the very few First World countries that wasn't predominantly Caucasian, before the Four Asian Tigers (South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) got to First World level as well via market reforms and liberalization. While its status as a relative powerhouse is fading due to the rise of China, Japan is still the third or fourth biggest economy in terms of GDP<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7w5dw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7w5dw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7w5dw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Depending on whether you count nominal terms or adjust for purchasing power parity, India may or may not be larger</span>, and its currency is still considered to be a major player in markets - investors relied on the the relatively stable yen during the 2008 financial crisis when the dollar and euro became unreliable. Also note that Japan, despite Article 9, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">still has the 5th-largest defense budget in the world and can be considered to be a potential nuclear state</a> (if pushed, it could develop a nuclear weapon in a matter of months) - so far the only known reasons it isn't actually so is due to the constitution, public opinion, and holding nukes seen as redundant due to the Japan-US alliance.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">The Qing Empire</a> was a shadow of its former self by the time of European (and later, Japanese) expansion into its territory, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedChina">modern China</a> is noticeably smaller than it used to be. Mongolia is now independent, and Taiwan its own country to say the least (the details behind that are rather complicated and will be discussed below). In spite of going through a humiliating cultural and economic decline in the past two centuries, most of its key territories were intact and the country was still by far one of the largest and most (over) populated countries in the world. With the resurgence of Chinese economic and political power in the 21st century, it can be said that this trope applies to China no longer.
<ul><li> It should also be noted that at various points of Chinese history, the empire has gained territory, lost territory, regained territory, or even split up and later reunited. Both the Warring States and Three Kingdoms periods follow after the fall of a major dynasty (the ancient Zhou and imperial Han respectively) and involved disparate successor states vying among each other for influence. They were succeeded by the Qin Dynasty (recognized as the first actual "Chinese" empire) and the Jin Dynasty respectively.
</li><li> And on top of that, apart from the Yuan dynasty which was part of the Mongolian Empire, the Qing dynasty had the largest territory in the history of China. Even with the loss noted above, the current Chinese territory is still larger than most of the territories in other dynasties.
</li><li> Now that we come to Taiwan, the actual title as a country is the <em>Republic of China</em>, as opposed to the <em>People's</em> Republic of China that serves as the title for the mainland proper. Formerly a part of China itself, the territory developed its own distinct nationality when it became the refuge of the Chinese Nationalist government in 1949. For awhile, it continued to represent China and even retained its UN seat until 1971, when it was given to the PRC. As time went on and the government became more native, the claim to being the sole representative of China was de-emphasized to the point where it no longer exists in fact (theory is another question; see below). While relations with the mainland have thawed over the years, it is still uncertain at this point in time what Taiwan actually is: the remnant territory of the former Chinese government or an independent country in its own right? However it goes about it, declaring for one or the other has repercussions that would adversely affect the territory and its international relationships.
</li></ul></li><li> The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. At one point it was a Central European superpower, spanning from the Baltic Sea on the north to the Black Sea in the south. The Commonwealth managed to successfully invade what would later become the inpenetrable Russian Empire. <em>Twice</em>. They managed to survive near-total Swedish invasion, while defending themselves from Hungary, the Cossacks and other neighbours <em>at the same time</em>. They also saved Austria, and by extension, the rest of Europe, in 1683. Internal bickering, noble houses and confederations selling out to neighbouring superpowers, and general anarchy - all this led to the Commonwealth's three-stage partitions at the end of 18th century. Although Poland managed to rebuild some of its holdings after WWI, its current, post-WWII size is very, very unimpressive. Still, Poland's current borders are quite close to the way they used to be, pre-Commonwealth.
<ul><li> Size-wise it's not unimpressive at all, Poland still grew bigger, just in the western direction. The post-WWI "rebuilt Polish holdings" are now Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, with the terroristic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> added for free! And yet, the Poles are quick to blame the Soviets for capturing "their" territories, while preferring to forget that their new post-WWII territories were mercilessly taken from Germany by Stalin and then given to the "friendly people of Poland" by the same Stalin, with all the Germans deportated so that a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> wouldn't rise in Poland. In the end, Poland got these new, German-free lands, for a price of losing their chance to play the Empire at the expense of Ukraine and Belarus.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQTq07gihqg">The country's anthem<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> speaks <em>volumes</em> of this trope, the lyrics beginning with the phrase "Poland is not yet lost..."
</li><li> Applies more to the Lithuanian half of the Commonwealth. Before joining together with Poland, Lithuania was a vast empire stretching from the Baltic nearly to the Black Sea. Even as part of the Commonwealth, much of former Lithuanian territory was captured by the rising Russian Empire while its aristocracy largely became Polonized. It is now a tiny country on the Baltic. On the other hand, it did retake its old capital Vilnius from the Poles after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dutch Empire once consisted of the following: South Africa, Formosa (Currently Taiwan), Suriname, Sri Lanka and Indonesia (not including their various coastal settlements in Africa, America and Asia). The remnants of this empire are a few islands in the Caribbean and a large influences in all kinds of languages, ranging from Afrikaans, English and even Japanese.
<ul><li> The Dutch Province of Friesland used to be an kingdom stretching from Belgium to Denmark and Cologne. Since the middle ages its power declined and now it's one of the least populated provinces.

</li><li> The Kievan Rus' (the original East Slavic state) used to occupy what is now Northern Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Russia. It was a powerful state on par with the Western kingdoms whose royalty intermarried with the West. Then the Mongols came, completely devastating the princedom. In the following centuries, the nation would never again regain the former glory, although there were several attempts, such as Galicia-Volhynia, Svitrigailo's faction in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ruthenian Cossack state (eventually annexed by the Russian Empire under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>). Ukraine considers itself to be an heir to the Kievan Rus', especially since the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv was originally the capital of the princedom. Interestingly, the current territory of Ukraine (the second-largest nation in Europe after Russia) is not that much smaller than that of the Kievan Rus' at the height of its power (however, only central and western Ukraine correspond to old Ruthenian core territories, while southern and eastern Ukraine was colonized much later). Military and economic power is a different story, though. It's telling that the anthem of Ukraine starts with the words "Ukraine's [glory and freedom] are not dead yet".
<ul><li> Incidentally, the Grand Princes of Moscow (and later, the Tsars of Russia) were descended from a collateral line of the Kievan Rus', and they claimed to be the rightful heirs of the Roman Empire after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks by virtue of the fact that one of their rulers married a Byzantine princess. If you've been reading this list closely, you might have noticed a common theme by now.
</li></ul></li><li> Yugoslavia was originally an idea by Serb nationalists to create a Serbian empire out of the dying embers of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, this was going well - Serbia was given most of the Balkan territories of the two now defunct aforementioned empires, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was formed. Then came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and an Axis invasion in 1941. Two resistance movements emerged - a Serbian nationalist movement known as the Chetniks, and a left-wing front known as the Partisans led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosipBrozTito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosipBrozTito">Josip Broz Tito</a>. The Partisans won, and retained Yugoslavia as a socialist republic, but Serbia, now rather than being dominant, was one of six equal constituent republics in a federation. After Tito's death, Yugoslavia crumbled until by the late 1990s, only Serbia and Montenegro remained, continuing to call their state 'Yugoslavia' until 2003. In 2006 Montenegro seceded, and while it remains legally disputed, Kosovo has been <em>de facto</em> independent since 2008.
</li><li> Russia had fallen into this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>. Under the Soviet Union, Russian influence extended from the Pacific Ocean to the Danube to the Caribbean. They were the first to send a satellite, and then the first humans, into space. In the first post-Soviet decade, its military was engaged in bloody, indecisive war in Chechnya, had to abandon its only space station and struggled to maintain influence over the other former Soviet republics and remain a major power. Subverted in the subsequent decades which saw a recovery of Russia and the return of it as a great power. How long this lasts, of course, remains to be seen as Russia's actions in Ukraine has attracted the ire of every other Western nation, leading to sanctions and international pressure.
<ul><li> In some sense, Soviet Union was initially this to the Russian Empire. After defeating Napoleon, Imperial Russia dominated the stretch of territory from the English Channel in the west to the Rockies in the east, spanning most of Europe, all of Asia, and much of North America. In the hundred years afterwards, they lost influence over Central Europe, sold off Russian America, and of course fell apart completely during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. In a way though, the Soviet Union at its peak in the Cold War had practically half of the world under its influence much like the United States. Both nations appalled to anti-colonial movements early in the Cold War when possible to buy influence at the expense of the waning European empires, but the Soviet collapse and rising anti-American sentiment has arguably lead to a multi-polar world despite America remaining the sole hyperpower.
</li></ul></li><li> At one time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Croatia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Croatia">Croatia</a> was a really good example of this trope. Though not being an empire, but rather an administrative division with certain degree of autonomy within the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Croatia definitely was this in 1594, at the height of ottoman conquest of Europe. It had been reduced to but a shadow of it's former self. Fortunately it managed to pull itself from the brink due to a spectacular victory in the Battle of Sisak in which some 8.000-20.000 ottoman soldiers were either slain or drowned, whilst croats suffered a loss of mere 50 soldiers. This period also gave birth to a phrase "reliquiae reliquiarum olim inclyti regni Croatiae" ("remnants of the remnants of the once great kingdom of Croatia").
</li><li> Mexico had been a literal empire (emperor and all) for two short periods in the 19th century and for a short period of time officially governed over Central America (which would become the United Provinces of Central America, which still lives on in the flags of its former member states if nowhere else) and much of what is now the Southwest of the US. Mexico is still a big country by all accounts, but it's nowhere near "empire" big. However, in a weird inversion of this trope, the actual control of the central government is actually stronger today<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8f32r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8f32r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8f32r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> If you ignore the drug war that is</span> than when it nominally controlled "Alta California" and "Tejas".
</li><li> <strong>Belgium</strong> used to have an empire several times its own size when its king Leopold II managed to make what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo his personal property and Belgium later took it over as a "normal" colony. Nowadays Belgium is reduced to bickering over who gets to vote in the Brussels constituency and delicious waffles. On the other hand Belgium has mostly stopped massacring people in Africa, which is nice. In addition, Brussels serves as the headquarters for NATO and de-facto capital of the European Union.
</li><li> Jordan is arguably an example as, while not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> of a unified state/empire, it's the last state ruled by the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashemites">Hashemite dynasty.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The Hashemites were the rulers of Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in Islam, and for centuries were vassals to the Ottomans (whose Sultan used the empire's possession of Mecca to proclaim himself Caliph up until the new Republic of Turkey abolished the Caliphate in 1924). In 1916, Sharif Hussein ibn Ali revolted against the Ottomans and, with British aid, led the Arab Revolt which liberated many Arab lands from Ottoman rule over the following two years. Sharif Hussein declared himself "King of the Arab Lands", but British and French <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes-Picot_Agreement">politicking<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> prevented a unified Arab state from forming. Instead, Hussein was allowed to rule over the newly-formed Kingdom of Hejaz (the western part of the Arabian peninsula, along the Red Sea coast), and his sons Abdullah and Faisal were granted rule over the carved-out states of the Emirate of Transjordan and Mandatory Iraq, respectively, both states under the "protection" of the British (Interestingly, Faisal attempted to declare an independent Arab state in the French Mandate of Syria, but the revolt was put down by the French and left Faisal dependent on the British, who allowed him to become the King of Iraq in recognition of his popularity among Arabs, provided he stay loyal to them). Sharif Hussein soon proved unreliable to Britain, who switched their patronage to the rivals of the Hashemites, the Saudis, whose leader, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbdulAzizIbnSaud">Ibn Saud</a>, was building a state of his own in Eastern Arabia. Ibn Saud soon conquered The Hejaz (with Sharif Hussein forced into exile in Transjordan), and was eventually incorporated into the new state of Saudi Arabia. Faisal's branch of the family lasted a few more decades as Iraq was granted full independence from Britain in 1932, but Faisal's grandson (Faisal II) was killed in 1958 during a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_July_Revolution">nationalist coup<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by military officers who felt that despite nominal independence, the Iraqi Hashemites were still in essence British puppets. Today, Jordan (which was granted full independence in 1946) is still ruled by the Hashemites, under Abdullah's great-grandson Abdullah II, in a relative contsitutional monarchy that, while still granting real political power to the monarch, is far more liberal than the other monarchies of the region.
</li><li> In a small-scale example, countless chains of businesses, typically in the retail and/or food sectors, have fallen off the map either completely or partially as a result of changing markets, internal issues, or simple bad luck. For instance, while RadioShack used to be everywhere, thanks to their bankruptcies and sale to Sprint, only a few stragglers remain, typically independent franchisees who continue to use the RadioShack name and branding. Other places may be basically debranded versions of what they were before and may continue to offer similar products (especially in the cases of fast-food joints). Here's a blog that <a class="urllink" href="http://actionsdower.blogspot.com/">chronicles many of said broken chains.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> While Egypt was falling into and then in the first century of its 3rd Intermediate Period, its fellow Bronze Age empire of Assyria was in a vestigial empire phase of its own, contracting to its core territories in the wake of the Bronze Age Collapse, and remaining so for just over a century. Unusually for this trope, it then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurgentEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurgentEmpire">bounced back</a>, taking advantage of the fact that pretty much everyone around them had fared worse to found an iron age Neo-Assyrian Empire that would last for three centuries and reach farther than the Middle Assyrian Empire ever had.
</li><li> Bulgaria, twice. The first Bulgarian empire in the early middle ages encompassed the country's modern territory plus those of Romania, Moldova, Macedonia, and parts of Greece, Albania, Serbia and Turkey. Some time after its destruction it was revived as a smaller empire, but still spanning over much of the Balkans early on before it got reduced to what is now Northern Bulgaria and Southern Romania. After it too fell, its people struggled for centuries to liberate themselves and the country was finally restored and its goals for national unity initially featured regaining all territories of the Second empire. While the third state was initially a monarchy band called itself the same as its earlier incarnations ("Tsarstvo" literally means "empire" from Tsar = Caesar = Emperor), its rulers and citizens now thought of it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKingdom">The Kingdom</a>, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, Romania used to be an empire in the ancient times, called Dacia back then. Dacia ( ancient kingdom in Romania and Moldova) used to be a powerful empire and one of the bighest threats of the Roman Republic under <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> under the rule of the Mighty King, Burebista (reign:82 BC. - 44 BC.). Dacia under Burebista managed to conquer between 60 BC until the king's death in 44 BC many people,tribes and kingdoms like the celtic tribes in the Balkans and Central Europe(Boii,Scordiscii);the greek city state in the western shores of the Black Sea(from Odessa to Apollonia);the Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace;some germanic tribes(Marcomanni,Bastarnae) and dome sarmatian tribes. Burebista's Dacian Empire streched its boundaries from west, Bohemia(Czech Republic) and Bavaria (SE Germany) to east, Odessa,Ukraine and from the north, Southern Poland and Belarus and to the south, Thrace (European Turkey,Bulgaria and N-E Greece). Burebista was refered by governor of the then greek city colony of Dyonisopolos as "The First and the Greatest of all the thracian kings" or the King of King of his own empire. However, the Roman Republic under Caesar declared his empire, alongside with the Parthian Empire as the two great threats of Rome because Burebista supported Pompey during the brutal Roman civil war against Julius Caesar (49 BC - 48 BC) and was defeated in Greece and was killed in the Ptolemaic Empire of Egypt. Bur Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and Burebista will met the same fate afterwards in the same year. After Burebista's assassination, his empire was split in 4 and later 5 kingdoms in Dacia. After that Decebalus (reign: 87 AD - 106 AD) will unify Dacia one last time as a defensive kingdom against therapidally expanding <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanEmpire">Roman Empire</a>, but Decebalus' kingdom was a shadow of its former self as a conquering , powerful empire and the Dacian Kingdom will be absorbed by Rome in 106 AD. Burebista's Dacian Empire (82 BC - 44 BC) will be the only event in the Romania's history when the state chose the faith of conquering and becoming a mighty empire which was a short lived rival of Ancient Rome.
