In the story <em>Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night</em>, it is revealed that Danzo actually leaked the knowledge that Naruto hosts the Nine-Tails, to instigate hatred against him.
</li><li> Konohamaru and Hanabi have been a popular ship since Part 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, despite never interacting, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> element on NaruHina fans part. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em>, they're shown bonding over their shared love of Boruto (Hanabi's nephew and Konohamaru's student).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The author has a question and answer column, but half of the time when someone asks about a fact he'll agree with any reasonable guess the writer makes (for instance several of the main characters' birthdays).
<div class="indent"><strong>Fan:</strong> Chopper's birthday should be December 24th!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Oda:</strong> Okay.
</div></li><li> At one point, a fan noted that one of the villains of the show, Rob Lucci, had a name that that could be interpreted as "To rob the light" based on the (inaccurate) fact that Lucci is the Italian word for light. Oda's response was to the general effect of:
<div class="indent"> "You know me. I'm the guy who comes up with the deep meaningful names. Yep. In fact, "Rob Lucci" even means "steal the light," or SO I HEAR (had no idea)."
</div></li></ul></li><li> The authors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em> routinely adapted fan suggested characters into the story, both minor and major.
</li><li> Same goes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KongohBancho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KongohBancho">Kongoh Bancho</a></em>, where several fan-characters have gone on to become both minor and major antagonists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Battle Angel Alita Last Order</a></em> accepted a few fan-submitted characters into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">ZOTT tournament</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: During the first season, fans joked that Lelouch's maid Sayoko was secretly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">ninja</a>, explaining the occasional flashes of competence seen behind her quiet exterior. Between seasons the staff acknowledged the joke, and in <em>R2</em> it's revealed that she is in fact the heiress to the Shinozaki ninja clan.
</li><li> The author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em>, previous to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>, wrote down in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Cho</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Hakkai's</a> character profile "voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraIshida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraIshida">Akira Ishida</a>" as a joke, not expecting to be taken seriously, and was pleasantly surprised that her casting suggestion was accepted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some of the Super Saiyan forms and names of the villains were fan nicknames. Perhaps most obvious was "Super Saiyan Blue" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Resurrection 'F'</a></em>, which is officially termed "Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan." Fans decided that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">too much of a mouthful</a>. Later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Goku acknowledges the name length and "Super Saiyan Blue" is used officially from then on (though most official merchandise and video games still designate the form as SSGSS as opposed to SSB).
</li><li> Fanfiction gives Vegeta enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorEarth">long-lost siblings</a> to populate a galaxy (and then some). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallYoSonGokuAndHisFriendsReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallYoSonGokuAndHisFriendsReturn">The 2008 special</a> went ahead and ran with that premise, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedByCanon">Jossed all of the usual traits associated with them</a> (with Tarble being a weakling instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopycatSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopycatSue">Copycat Sue</a>)
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em> (a fan parody, therefore counts as fanon; in fact the most well-known of its kind) to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em>: Nappa hates the media.
</li><li> Freeza's race are widely known as "Frost Demons" among the fandom, due to the fact that all of the members seen have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">names related to cold temperatures</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse">Dragon Ball Xenoverse</a></em>, Cell refers to them using this name.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s English dub, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> Zeno is referred to as "The Omni-King", a term first used by fansubbers as a rough translation of the title "Zen'O" (literally, "All-King").

A sufficiently clever explanation would win the fan a "No Prize." When some apparently-not-so-clever fans started writing in asking when they would receive <em>their</em> No Prize, Marvel responded to them by mailing them... an empty envelope. Sadly, this practice has fallen to the wayside, though oddly, the empty "No Prize" envelope is considered of some value by the more hardcore fans.
<ul><li> One example: It was a fan theory that the Marvel Universe is called Earth-616 because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> #1</em> (the first Marvel Universe comic) came out in 1961 in month 6.

Decide for yourself whether this was simply the most obvious fix, or whether the legion of forum threads and fix-it fanfics using this exact scenario during the intervening years of her death inspired DC.
</li><li> There was a lot of controversy and in-fighting (some of it racial in nature) in the Batgirl fandom when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Cassandra Cain</a> (an Asian-American) was replaced by Stephanie Brown (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromeCasting">a white blonde</a>), and again when Steph was replaced herself when the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, returned. A common compromise in fan works was to feature all three Batgirls in a sort of "Batgirl Inc." or "Team Batgirl" grouping, and DC eventually instituted a similar idea with the League of Batgirls in the <em>Future's End</em> tie-in to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2011">Batgirl</a></em> run.

To make up for that Morrison makes them both materialize out of thin air and attack Animal Man, while he is thanking everybody he worked with on the series. He also mentioned that Buddy is what writers wants him to be, so if they'll decide to make him eat meat, he will. Next writer on the series decided to play with that and wrote a story where Buddy copies the abilities of a lion, is overcome by its instincts and tries to eat a gazelle.

It wasn't until 1992 that he was confirmed to be bisexual.
</li><li> This was the exact reason we have the explanation for the origin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s legendary shield. A fan by the name of "Fred Janssen" wrote in to the 60s-era Captain America comic with a theory involving Dr. Myron McClain and his work with Adamantium and Vibranium, the fictional super alloys in the Marvel Universe. Marvel liked the idea so much that, with a bit of altering, they took it and ran with it!

Due to this, the few times he did take it off, his hair color kept changing because the colorists didn't know what color it actually was, it ranged from blond to black and everything in between, except red. Fanfic writers decided that he dyed his hair, which was naturally red, to explain away the constantly changing hair colors. This was later made actual canonicity in an issue of Stormwatch: Team Achilles.

The Female Symbiote and another one got the names Scream and Lasher for a toy line while another symbiote in the line (though not from the comics) was called Riot; the other two had no names but were referred to by fans as Agony and Phage. Scream became canonical during a handbook released around the time of the Back in Black storyline in the mid-2000s while it wouldn't be until 2011's <em>Carnage USA</em> miniseries that officially gave the fan names to the other ones as well.

Tim Sheridan, the writer of the direct-to-DVD film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCurseOfThe13thGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheCurseOfThe13thGhost">Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost</a></em>, stated in a tweet that he counted 12 ghosts being recaptured with "Ship of Ghouls" included, which suggests that the ship captain being one of the 13 ghosts is now canon.

<ul><li> Ever since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">Alien</a></em> was released, there has been a persistent fan theory that the Xenomorphs were actually biological weapons. The argument goes that the Xenomorph is simply too powerful a predator to have evolved naturally, and there is no ecosystem that could have supported it. Since there was a ship with a bunch of Xenomorph eggs on it, which appeared to have been crewed by a completely different species, the theory went that the pilots of the ship (the so-called Space Jockeys) created the Xenomorphs as a biological weapon to use on their enemies. The ship crashed and the crew was killed when one of the Xenomorphs got loose. Many years later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus">Prometheus</a></em> confirmed most of this.
</li><li> When an aficionado asked the creator of the Na'vi language from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> if the word for "star" (tanh&igrave;; pl. sanh&igrave;) also was used for the Na'vi bioluminescent freckles, he said sure, why not.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>'s original Japanese name, <em>Gojira</em>, is generally accepted to be a portmanteau of the Japanese words for "gorilla" (gorira) and "whale" (kujira). So....GorillaWhale! Americans decided "God Lizard" was a better name. While the Japanese still call him "Gojira", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShinGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShinGodzilla">Shin Godzilla</a></em> makes a side comment that the name means "Incarnation of God" and some characters in the Japanese movie use the name "Godzilla" as well.
</li><li> The very last scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrifters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGrifters">The Grifters</a></em> is a distant shot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnjelicaHuston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnjelicaHuston">Anjelica Huston</a>'s character driving away down a dark street.

When someone asked the producer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, if it <em>was</em> Cusack's character, he reportedly replied, "Sure, Why Not?"

But fans, being fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBystander">latched on to this character</a> (played by Bret MacKenzie of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords">Flight of the Conchords</a> fame) and formed stories and relationships around him, bestowing upon him the name "Figwit" (an acronym for "Frodo is great... who is that?!"). So big was his fanbase that he was brought back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Return of the King</a></em>, actually given a couple of lines, and&mdash;though officially credited as "Elf Escort" &mdash; is called "Figwit" in the filmmakers' DVD commentary. Canonization was complete when MacKenzie's character appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, this time named onscreen as Lindir ("the singer").

They are occasionally referred to as such by Don Coscarelli during the DVD commentaries as well, suggesting that he's adopted this term for them.

This was likely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a> discussing it in interviews, since Richards was an influence on Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow.
</li><li> In the same film Barbossa's first name is "Hector", an idea that was worked out privately with Depp and Rush while filming <em>Curse of the Black Pearl</em>, and caught on with fans after Depp mentioned it in the DVD commentary.
</li><li> Lt. Theodore Groves, played by Greg Ellis, was just "Groves" in the first movie, but fans took a shine to him and gave him a first name and a backstory, much to the actor's surprise and delight, and the creators were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">onboard.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> canonizes Uhura's first name of Nyota, which was invented by fan William Rotsler and endorsed by Nichelle Nichols, and had been generally adopted for years. (Though, technically it's only <em>known</em> to be her name in the alternate timeline of the movie, not the original one.) The same movie canonized the names George and Winona for James T. Kirk's parents, coined in a novel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VondaNMcIntyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VondaNMcIntyre">Vonda N. McIntyre</a>.

</li><li> Kirk being from Iowa was fanon before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">Star Trek IV</a></em>. Someone told Nicholas Meyer, who was one of the film's writers, that Kirk was from Iowa. Consequently, it ended up in the film and became canonical.

It had reached the level of fanon that Boba Fett's armor was the type worn by the predecessors of the Imperial Stormtroopers during the Clone Wars (this was based on a statement in the novelizations, which said the armor dated back to the Clone Wars). This ended up being excruciatingly close to the truth (the Clone Troopers original armor was a mass-produced version of Jango Fett's armor without most of his cool gizmos.)
</li><li> Long before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> was a blip on anyone's radar, it was almost universally accepted fan lore that Darth Vader got his famous cybernetic enhancements after falling into a lava pit during his first confrontation with Obi-Wan Kenobi. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Background details</a> from the Original Trilogy stated that he had to rely on life support because Obi-Wan grievously injured him and left him for dead, and there's a vague reference to "memories of molten lava, crawling up his back" in the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, but nowhere is it explicitly stated that he and Obi-Wan had their first duel over a pool of lava. That detail was, of course, officially canonized with the Mustafar duel in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, which concluded the Prequel Trilogy. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cqux');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0cqux" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cqux');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It may also have had its roots in the originally planned ending for <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. Some unused concept art indicates that Luke's final confrontation with the Emperor was originally supposed to have taken place at the edge of a lava pit on the (then-unnamed) Imperial Capital. Some fans might have assumed that Vader got his injuries from that very same lava pit, which would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">given a nice symmetry to his arc</a>.</span>

Her name was eventually adopted by Lucasfilm for the commander of the First Order Stormtroopers, and she was geared with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion">chrome Stormtrooper armor</a> originally designed for Kylo Ren.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> officially canonizes a popular fan theory about Han Solo's famous Kessel Run. For years, seemingly every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fan had their own favorite explanation for why Han bragged about making the Kessel Run "in less than twelve parsecs" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, since a parsec is a unit of <em>distance</em> rather than time. Some believed that it was an intentional error, meant to demonstrate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Han was just talking out of his ass</a>; others believed that he was surreptitiously testing Luke and Obi-Wan's knowledge of space travel, and wanted to see if they would correct him; others believed that he was bragging about the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>'s navigational capabilities, referring to the specific <em>route</em> that he took through the Kessel system. The last explanation was incorporated into the film as a major plot point: Han once took a particularly dangerous shortcut through the Maw Cluster while smuggling valuable cargo from Kessel, allowing him to complete the run in a much shorter distance than normal. It <em>also</em> incorporates the "talking out of his ass" theory by Han insisting to skeptical onlookers that it's twelve parsecs "if you round down".
</li><li> <em>Solo</em> also confirmed the popular theory that Vader's famous theme tune "The Imperial March" is an in-universe military anthem used by the Galactic Empire (though this had already been done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>). Sure enough, it can be heard playing in the Imperial recruitment video that Han watches in the opening scene in the Corellia spaceport.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> doesn't reveal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s true origin, but that hasn't stopped fans from trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guess</a> it. The most popular one is that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromCamouflageToCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromCamouflageToCriminal">formerly a soldier</a> before turning to crime, which would explain his proficiency with military-grade weapons (most notably a rocket launcher) and his targeting of government bureacrats like Harvey Dent.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, a very common fan theory was that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a> was among the F-22s that fire on Megatron in the climax.</span> The producers haven't said definitely that it's canonical, but their stance so far has been "Sure, why not?" The tie-in comic <em>The Reign of Starscream</em> acknowledged this by having Starscream consider it, but decide not to. In the sequel, after Megatron is revived with the help of Scalpel, he accuses Starscream of this while beating him with his own severed arm. Starscream responds in a way that leaves it uncertain.
</li><li> When one of the writers was answering fans' questions in a forum topic on the movie's website, he was asked how Bumblebee was suddenly able to speak at the end of the movie. His answer was that the healing laser Ratchet used earlier in the movie had repaired Bumblebee's vocal processor. When another fan suggested that Bumblebee was healed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Allspark</a>, which was clearly shown to heal another damaged Transformer earlier in the movie, the writer admitted that that explanation did make more sense than his answer.
</li><li> A lot of fanfics center on the idea that Bumblebee was raised by the Autobots with Optimus himself usually being his central parental figure. In <em>Age of Extinction</em>, Optimus confirms he raised Bumblebee when discussing moody teens with Cade.

</li><li> Peter Goldworthy's <em>Maestro</em> features a piano teacher/virtuoso living in Darwin, Australia, having fled the Nazis from his native Vienna. As Maestro is a high-school study favorite in Australia, it spawned a classroom theory that this was intentional on the part of the author: Having fled from Der Wien in Austria to Darwin in Australia was a metaphor showing that the maestro had never really come to terms emotionally with his forced migration. On part of a speaking tour, one high school student finally got to put this theory to the author, and ask if it was true. Peter Goldworthy's memorable response: "It is now."

Early in the series, a few puns worked their way into the stories. A few young readers sent in pun suggestions, which Piers Anthony included in the next novel in the series and mentioned the readers by name in the author notes. Now <em>Xanth</em> is known for being full of these puns, which have directly and completely shaped the world, taking it from a rather static fantasy world to something decidedly more, and Piers Anthony is now known for his ungodly huge (chapter-sized) author notes thanking every single reader for every single pun he uses. To the point where he has spent the last several books asking his readers to ease off. He's repeatedly said the books would be much easier to write if the readers stopped trying to help him.

<ul><li> The tendency of the fandom to refer to the Power Coins by their totem animal rather than their color has absolutely no basis in the series itself, and its earliest known use was in the fanfics of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan">Joe Rovang</a>. However, as this caused a great deal of confusion when discussing different sets of coins with the same color, his precedent was followed above the show's. This is particularly apparent when Disney's official site for <em>PR</em> used "Dragon Coin" for the Green Ranger's Power Coin, as Rov did, rather than "Dragonzord Coin" as the morphing call <em>used in every episode featuring the Green Ranger</em> would imply.
</li><li> As it only originated in obscure production documents from Saban Entertainment, Billy's surname of "Cranston" was known mostly by fans. When Disney later culled the knowledge of these fans to construct their official site, they just ran with it. This also led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a> status of Jen and Katie's surnames from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em>.

<ul><li> The Klingons' gaining forehead ridges between the original series and the movies and later series has long been a subject of fan speculation. In a question and answer session at a Star Trek convention just after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> was released, James Doohan (Scotty) joked that the ridges were from all the tribbles he beamed to the Klingon ship in The Trouble with Tribbles. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space 9</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> episode "Trials and Tribble-Ations", two popular fan theories, including the tribble theory, are brought up by two non-Klingon characters, but are told by Worf that Klingons don't discuss the situation with outsiders. Odo seems to accept the tribble theory, joking about <em>the great tribble hunt.</em>. Eventually, the prequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>, which had ridged Klingons, had to tackle not just the "how'd Klingons get ridges?" question, but "how'd Klingons lose their ridges and then get them back?" A multi-part episode shows it happening in a way that actually incorporates both theories. Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> theory, which hasn't been endorsed by the powers that be yet, is that they underwent cosmetic surgery in between TOS and DS9. The real reason, which is not hidden, was the low budget of the original series, which was not intended to be so big. They seemed to have shot themselves in the foot by having Kor, Kang, and Koloth from the original series show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> as modern Klingons but the novel "Rules of Engagement" explained that away: the genetic engineering had been reversed. That and the in-series canon explains why the <em>Enterprise</em> Klingons do not look more like the <em>TOS</em> Klingons. This is probably why the deleted scenes from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> film show Klingons on Rura Penthe wearing masks. However, even the <em>Enterprise</em> explanation doesn't say that all Klingons lost their ridges. Apparently, the ridgeless ones were an embarrassment, so they were sent to do do the jobs that other Klingons despised, like patrolling the borders. This presumably explains why they were almost permanently disgruntled, hostile and rather lacking in honour when they met humans.
</li><li> "Future Guy"'s name in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> came from fans on the internet, and eventually the producers of Enterprise used it as the character's actual name in the script.

<div class="indent"> I must say, someone told me [about the anagram], and I think it's a complete mystery, because it's so complete. There does appear to be an anagram in the title. And it's a mystery. It was not intentional. But you know, I like those things, when things happen like that. It's kind of spooky.

</li><li> Some fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Custard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Custard">Custard</a> mistook the "D" in the band's signature typeface for an "O", which led the band to credit themselves as Custaro in some of their album artwork.

"Sitting Still" from Murmur contains the line 'We could gather, throw a fit'. When one fan told Stipe he had thought it was 'We could gather through our fear', Stipe told him &#147;No, but that sounds great. I might use that.

</li><li> In the Eye of Terror campaign, three Disorder players advised other players where best to attack. They called themselves the Triad. The next campaign newsletter detailed the lore of what happened, especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">Galactic Conqueror</a>... and his advisers, the "mysterious group known only as the Triad." Another fan, on the Tau Empire Third Stage Expansion front, posted messages as "Sa'Caea Sally", a human sympathizer urging the citizens of the Imperium to join the Tau. This also got a mention in the newsletter, and in the 4th Edition Codex.
</li><li> There was also one particular Order player, Canoness Astra, who had a Sisters of Battle army that coordinated the defense for one of the sectors of the war and got special mention in the game newsletters and in the summary at the end of the war.
</li><li> During a campaign the Orks were expected to try to hinder the Tau expansion. Unfortunately for the Imperium the Ork players were unhappy about being shafted like that, and instead banded together to start the 'Green Kroosade' which wound up with them sacking an Imperial Forge World. 'The Green Kroosade' was mentioned in name in official articles after the Eye of Terror.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> has, through its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">multi-decade run</a>, collected a wide variety of officially published interesting places to visit, distributed over a span of space that takes years to cross even with the fastest ships in the setting. <a class="urllink" href="http://travellermap.com/">Travellermap<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> started as an unofficial compilation of all these places. As of Mongoose Publishing's second edition, specifically the Great Rift books, this is not only canon, but a thing that actually exists in-universe: a "widely distributed" "astronavigational database" written for travellers (read: for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">Player Characters</a>) by the Travellers' Aid Society. The (less canonical) edges of the map are still being explored, so naturally they are updated over time. All discrepancies are explained: scientific anomalies (especially in areas with no habitable planets) are left off because that is not the target audience for the map, military secrets are not available to the mappers, conflicts with prior published charts are things the mappers are no longer sure were there in the first place, and so on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> had an entire wing of it's design inspired by this. Early on, players came up with the idea of "Limited," a way to play where each player brought a small amount of unopened booster packs instead of a deck. Each player would build a deck that 2/3 the normal size out of these cards and then play each other. This proved to be so popular that sets began to be designed with Limited in mind starting with 1996's <em>Mirage</em> expansion. Limited is now divided into multiple formats and is a part of nearly every major tournament. In fact, most new collectible card games include some form of Limited straight from the get-go.
<ul><li> Similarly, the format/alternate game type known as EDH/Commander. Originally invented by Judges waiting for events to get started, the game is notable for its extra rules, both in deck construction<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ed1e');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4ed1e" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ed1e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">99 cards + 1 "commander" that starts the game in a separate zone and not your library. With the exception of a small banlist, any card ever printed is legal to use in and EDH deck. Also, no card in the 99 can have a colored mana symbol that the commander doesn't have; a commander that's Blue/black/red can have any combination of those three colors and colorless cards, but none that have white or green</span>, and in game play <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ekma');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5ekma" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ekma');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Starting life total is 40 and you can cast your commander from your command zone. Whenever he dies or is sent to anther zone,you can return it to the command zone to cast him again, but each time you do, he costs a cumulative 2 more mana. Also, there's a new win condition: If any commander deals 21 or more combat damage to a player, they immediately lose the game.</span>, as well as its focus on multiplayer; games with 4-6 players are common. It's since exploded in popularity<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6wo8a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6wo8a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6wo8a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's also spawn two similar formats in Brawl (60 cards, 30 life (25 in 1v1), any legendary or planeswalker can lead the deck, but only Standard legal cards can be in the deck) and Oathbreaker (60 cards, 20 life, any planeswalker + one 'signature spell' that can be any instant or sorcery (banlist notwithstanding) and has the same cumulative cost, but can only be cast when the commander is in play.)</span> to the point that it's theorized that it's the most played format in the entire game.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuGiOhTradingCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuGiOhTradingCardGame">Yu Gi Oh Trading Card Game</a> has had various 'Master Rules', the official rulebook that comes in the OCG which changes the gameplay slightly and explains the new game mechanics. The first three were Master Rule, Master Rule 2, and Master Rule 3. The next two were the New Master Rule and Master Rule Revision April 2020 - but, for convenience sake, the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequels">Oddly Named Sequels</a> are simply called Master Rules 4 and 5.

<ul><li> In the initial Two River production in 2015, Michael's sexuality is left ambiguous. Because of that as well as the lack of a Two River bootleg allowing for more room for interpretation, many fans at the time headcanoned Michael as being gay, and often portrayed him as wearing an LGBT flag patch on his jacket. The LGBT flag patch was made official in the 2018 Off-Broadway run and the story hints more at him being gay now. Official productions from here on keep this, making it canon.
</li><li> Fans came to the consensus that Rich used to have a lisp before his Squip made him work past it. This never received any nod in the Off-Broadway run, but it became canon once it moved to Broadway - at the end of the show, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once the Squip is gone forever</span>, he has a lisp again.

<ul><li> The names of the Hitchhiking Ghosts at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheHauntedMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheHauntedMansion">The Haunted Mansion</a></em> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disney Theme Parks</a> (Gus, Ezra, and Phinneas) were thought up by Cast Members, and eventually became popular enough in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> that it was semi-officially adopted.
<ul><li> Another Mansion example. For years, fans thought that a small circle of metal embedded in a brick outside the ride's exit was either Master Gracey's or the Bride's wedding ring, which was thrown from the attic window (in Gracey's case, he tossed it before committing suicide, while the Bride was said to have hurled the ring out of grief for losing her husband). The real explanation was far more mundane&mdash;the metal was the remnant of an old post used to keep guests in a line&mdash;but the theory became so pervasive that when the Mansion's queue got a massive remake, the Imagineers included a small wedding ring hidden in one of the bricks.
</li><li> Heck, even the <em>main character's name</em> is a bit of Ascended Fanon. One of the joke tombstones in the queue reads "Master Gracey, Laid to Rest&mdash;No Mourning Please at His Request." Riders began to assume that this "Master Gracey" was the "master" of the house, and quickly began ascribing him every role, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">Rapid Aging</a> man in the foyer's painting to the "Ghost Host" to the hanging corpse in the Portrait Room. None of these were the case (in fact, the term "master" was used by the servants of a household to refer to every male <em>but</em> the owner/patriarch, who was simply called "Sir"; the owner's official title would probably be "Lord"), but as before, Disney eventually canonized the term in both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHauntedMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHauntedMansion">the movie</a> and a series of comics based on the ride.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em>:
<ul><li> A previously unnamed team of heroes, with mostly unnamed members, was used to explain a bizarre similarity in names. A volcano that housed the fire village and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s lair were called Mangai and Mangaia, respectively. A fan had the idea that the aforementioned team be called the Toa Mangai, Mangai meaning protector, with the volcano being named after them. Mangaia would then be an archaic version of the same word, the lair being named that before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>. This led to many of the island's locations being retconned into the names of fallen friends of the village leaders.
</li><li> A higher-profile example is that a group called the Piraka used turrets called Nektann, and when another member of their race showed up in a story, a fan suggested "Hey, maybe the turrets were named after him?" The writer was like, "Okay," and wrote the newly-christened Nektann into a web story to make it official. A couple years later, it was promoted to the toyline when Lego made a new Piraka toy that didn't match any of the existing characters, so it was decided that it would be Nektann.
</li><li> This phenomenon has elevated to such heights that the fans have formed an official Story Squad that let people vote for whichever idea they would have liked to make canonical. If the "Aye"s outweighed the "Nay"s, the proposals were taken to official story writer Greg Farshtey, who then approved them, but only if they were to his liking. As with many things, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">upset</a> a number of fans, since the majority of voters also had a "Sure, why not?" attitude.
</li><li> Later on, Farshtey was denied access of fansites, so fans began dumping canonization requests at him through other means. This means that, even though the original <em>BIONICLE</em> storyline and universe has been abandoned for years, new ideas, concepts, names and retcons are still carelessly added to it in an unrelenting pace, and without the consent of the larger fan-base. Basically, it's a canonization free-for-all &mdash; no matter how pointless or how many long-time fans it might upset, if a fan idea has <em>any</em> sort of basis in the established canon, it has a good chance of becoming canonical itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> This appears to be pretty much what happened to the toyline-only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> character Sonar. Due to a gender-neutral bio, they were eventually labeled female by fans, and then it appeared in the official BotCon comics, and everything else followed suit.
<ul><li> The original toy of Rhinox came with what was intended as a spinning melee weapon. However, the show retooled it into a gun, which fans dubbed the "Kickass Chaingun of Doom." When the toy was rereleased for the series' 10th anniversary, the name (minus the "kickass" part, for obvious reasons) made it onto the box art.
</li></ul></li><li> Decepticons who turn into planes are referred to as Seekers. This term was possibly invented by the fandom and got adopted as the official term, but there are still questions over whether an old catalog advertisement citing them as "Decepticon Seekers" influenced the use of the term years later.
</li><li> The official <em>Universe</em> bio on Ratchet ascends his typical fanon interpretation as a cranky old doctor (at odds with his original G1 bio which notes that his love of partying interfered with his duties), while Wheeljack's <em>Generations</em> bio makes reference to his lab exploding on a regular basis&mdash;something not indicated in his original G1 bio, but a popular event in G1 fanfiction.
</li><li> In the Transformers Movie comic, a reader emailed in-character as their neutral fan-character and flirted with Barricade, asking to play 'Bad cop bad-cop-pretending-to-be-good-cop'. He flirted back. It is now pretty much canonical that Barricade likes chicks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse">Masters of the Universe</a></em> the race of the pre-accident Skeletor blue elf Keldor is known as "Gar" and has been officially referenced as such in the Classics toyline bios. This is because in the 2002 MYP Cartoon series there is an island called Anwat Gar. This is a clever play on the name of the Asian city of Angor Wat. The only resident of Anwat Gar is Sy Klone, a character based on the vintage toy that happens to have a blue face. So it is reasoned by the fans that Sy Klone must be a blue elf (by virtue of his skin color) like Keldor. And wouldn't "Gar" be an obvious name for the race, since it could be reasoned that Anwat Gar sounds kinda like it could be a foreign term for "City of Gar" or something like that? After years of common usage by fans on fansites, etc, Mattel decided "sure, why not?" This extends to the point that the modern DC comic series depicts Gar military uniforms looking almost identical to Sy-Klone's outfit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fans pleaded and petitioned for years with Kenner to make a Slave Leia (Leia in the metal bikini from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>) action figure; such a figure was #1 on <em>Wizard</em> magazines Top Ten Most Requested Action Figures for months.

Then she quietly asks him if he has done the math. During playtesting, right after she said it, Dog, as part of his idle animation, shook his head.

<ul><li> The "DS" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> originally stood for "Developer's System," as units released at that time were purely for developers to use in their production process. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note70ms5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note70ms5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note70ms5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The intended name for the final product would have been the "Nintendo Nitro".</span> The press kept insisting it stood for "Dual Screen", so Nintendo, realizing that they were already getting brand name recognition from it, just made DS the official name. Another theory is that the name "Developer's System" only came about because of a misinterpretation of what was said in an interview about how easy it is to develop for the DS, but the Internet took the quote and ran with it until suddenly many people thought DS originally stood for "Developer's System."
</li><li> This happened <em>again</em> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>.

The games were also playable on monochrome versions of the Game Boy, so for their sake the Pok&eacute;mon also emanated stars, earning them the nickname "shiny Pok&eacute;mon".

Anne had set sail. Like nearly everything else in the first-gen games, the fact that it existed at all yet didn't do anything immediately apparent made players make up all sorts of crazy rumors about how to get Mew and other unknown Pokemon from it.

The existence of alternate timelines was confirmed in the Hoenn remakes, however they imply the <em>X/Y</em> games takes place in a timeline alongside the <em>R/S/E</em> remakes.

Blue also makes several jokes about him being quiet.
</li><li> Prior to Generation VI, it was popular to hack Wonder Guard onto the Dark/Ghost-type Spiritomb ("Wondertomb") and Sableye ("Wondereye"), as their complete lack of weaknesses made them impervious to practically all direct damage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10azw1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10azw1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10azw1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">From Generation VI onward, this type combination is now weak to the Fairy type</span>.

Abominations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft">WarCraft</a> 3</em> did have hooks, but the ability to pull enemies in was originally an ability for an Abomination hero in the popular custom map <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em>.

However, it is likely that Alexstrasza was referring to a different plan for the character, as Arthas was shown retreating through the wrathgate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">without Bolvar's corpse, leaving it outside where anyone else who could have taken the corpse was killed</a>.
</li><li> The notorious Corrupted Blood Incident was a glitch made worse by malignant trolling players, and was never intentional, but it did give the developers some ideas. The Great Zombie Plague of 2008 (an event used to promote their <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> expansion, was similar and intentional. (However, unlike Corrupted Blood, which was 100% contagious and fatal, this zombie plague had minimal risk of player-to-player infection.)
<ul><li> Not only that, but the event itself was made canon in <em>Battle for Azeroth</em>, although as a historical epidemic rather than a recent one.
</li></ul></li><li> The quest chain to get the optional skin for the Retribution paladin artifact in Legion (Corrupted Ashbringer) is nearly identical to fan speculation about how to get the Ashbringer in vanilla (only a corrupted version of the sword existed in-game at this time). Players speculated endlessly about how you might acquire it. Blizzard compiled all this speculation and turned it into an actual quest chain in Legion.
</li><li> Back in classic <em>WoW</em>, many players speculated what the next Alliance race would be, with Worgen proving to be an immensely popular choice on the forums. While the Draenei had already been chosen as the next race, Blizzard seems to have held onto the idea, and would make Worgen a playable race come <em>Cataclysm</em>.
</li><li> Jed'hin, a draenei form of martial arts invented by roleplayers, was made canon in <em>Legion</em>.

<ul><li> Fan use of the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Werehog</a> was so commonplace in both the English and Japanese fandom, that Sega made it its official name (similarly, WereSonic was used to describe the character in the Wii/PS2 version on several occasions).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> canonized the Classic characters as being younger versions of the Modern characters, as well as Bark and Bean being antagonistic (according to Japanese-only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheFighters">Sonic the Fighters</a></em> supplementary material, they were intended to be Sonic's friends).

For unknown reasons a single Level 1 snail, the weakest enemy in the game, would randomly spawn in Drake's Meal Table, a high-level map, right along side Level 50+ drakes and other powerful monsters. Fans named the snail Bob and came up with various lore including that he is older than Grendel the Really Old, and that he is actually a hero who protects the world from the drakes. Many of these theories have been stated to be completely true and Bob is now an official boss enemy. Unfortunately, hero or not you still have to kill him for a number of quests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Guile's military buddy and mentor was originally known by two names: "Nash" in the Japanese versions and "Charlie" in the overseas versions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Many fans</a>, however, liked to render his full name as Charlie Nash (most likely influenced by the live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> film and subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter">cartoon series</a>, where Charlie and Blanka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">were combined into one character</a> named Carlos "Charlie" Blanka), a full name which was even adapted into UDON's comic adaptation. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, the designers decided to just go with this as Guile can be seen looking at a dog tag that reads "Charlie Nash" (likely to avoid having to drawn two versions of the same scene with a different name). By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, he now goes by Nash in every region.
</li><li> After <em>Street Fighter V</em> introduced a shirtless, bearded alternate costume for Ryu, the internet fell in love and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">dubbed</a> the design "Hot Ryu." When Storm Collectibles produced an action figure of Ryu in that outfit for their <em>Street Fighter</em> line, they officially named it Hot Ryu.
</li><li> A background character in Ken's stage in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> has been said by fans to resemble Q from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em>. It definitely wasn't intentional, since Q wasn't conceived until years after <em>II</em> came out. However, in supplementary materials written about the series and its lore, it's mentioned that Q was first spotted in an American harbor, which is an exact description of Ken's stage.
</li><li> The character Akuma owes his entire existence to this trope. In 1992, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> ran an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools</a> joke centering on Ryu and Ken's master Sheng Long <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13dasu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13dasu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13dasu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">inspired by Ryu's win quote "You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance"; in this case, "Sheng Long" is a mistranslation of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken">Shoryuken</a>"</span> and claiming that it was possible to fight him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> if one fulfilled some pretty ludicrous prerequisites. Capcom USA actually called up Capcom Japan to confirm if this was true or not; Capcom Japan decided to just run with it, inventing the character of Akuma and putting him into <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo</em> under a much less strict set of conditions. EGM revived the rumor in 1997, updated for <em>Street Fighter III</em>.
<ul><li> Years later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> made Ryu and Ken's <em>actual</em> master, Gouken, a playable character for the first time ever (he became canon in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em> series, but didn't appear before <em>IV</em> because he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">Only Mostly Dead</a>). Gouken's appearance was directly inspired by the EGM <em>Street Fighter III</em> rumor, and Producer Yoshinori Ono said that his inclusion was in response to fans who had been clamoring for Sheng Long for years. Players can even earn the gamer card title "AKA Sheng Long" by playing as him.
</li><li> Sheng Long himself has skirted this trope a few times over the years. He was almost included in the video game version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie">Street Fighter: The Movie</a></em> but had to be cut due to time constraints, and the Capcom Fighting Network website published a (tongue in cheek) <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328181753/http://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/column/131583">character profile<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for him, though it was later taken down.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the more infamous hacked versions of <em>Street Fighter II</em> is the so-called "Rainbow Edition", AKA "Street Fighter II Koryu", in which every character has crazy movesets: practically everyone can throw Hadokens, throws can hit from anywhere on screen, and you can change characters mid-fight by hitting Start. Capcom was unimpressed with the gameplay, but noticed that the game itself was faster than official <em>SFII</em> games, which lead to the creation of <em>SFII Turbo</em>. Additionally, a few ideas from <em>Rainbow Edition</em> filtered into official games, like Chun-Li gaining her own fireball (the Kikoken) in later iterations of <em>II</em>, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em> Ryu was given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">exploding</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">rapid-fire</a> Hadokens based off of some of the crazy ways projectiles acted in <em>Rainbow</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The overseas versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaturdayNightSlamMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaturdayNightSlamMasters">Saturday Night Slam Masters</a></em> states that Gunloc is rumored to be related to a famous street fighter, implying a relation to Guile due to the similarity of Gunloc's Sonic Fist attack. Gaming magazines further spread the rumor that Gunloc and Guile were brothers. Blade's ending in the arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie">Street Fighter: The Movie</a></em> reveals that he is actually Gunloc operating undercover as a Shadaloo trooper. It also reveals that he's Guile's brother, making the connection canon to that continuity. As for the main <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> continuity, this is not confirmed, though there is a profile for Blade on the Capcom Fighters Network website that describes him as a member of the North American branch of Shadaloo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken Tag Tournament 2</a></em> allows Jun Kazama to transform into Unknown, confirming fan theories that they are the same person. This only applies in the <em>Tag</em> universe as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame">they have a separate continuity from the main series</a>. Also of note is the fact that, in the original <em>Tag</em>, Unknown was intended to be Jun's sister, an element that was dropped when the game became a spin-off instead of a canonical entry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:

BioWare seemingly confirmed this with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomNod">Fandom Nod</a> in the third game, where if FemShep decides to romance Samantha Traynor, one conversation has Shepard defend <em>Vancouver</em> as being just as romantic as Paris or Tokyo.

In the <em>Citadel</em> DLC, Traynor makes them at a party.
</li><li> The fans felt that Kaidan had a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> with a male Shepard, although it's unclear whether they were deliberately planning on making him romanceable and cut that content or if it was just an artifact of BioWare's recording process. Cut to <em>3</em> and Kaidan becomes an acceptable romantic partner for both male and female Shepards.
</li><li> On the Bioware forums, there were various ideas for Reaper playable characters for the multiplayer. When the Leviathans were introduced, they became the most popular and lore-friendly excuse for such things. The Awakened Collector was introduced in the <em>Reckoning</em> DLC, being former Collectors who had their ties to Harbinger severed by the Leviathans.

Come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em>, the writers establish in the <em>character creation screen</em> that the protagonist has an opposite sex twin that's part of the adventure, though you only play as one twin.

An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">Urban Legend of Zelda</a> had it that clicking it a certain number of times or performing some arcane feat would unlock a Secret Cow Level.

</li><li> Kojima has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">tweeted</a>, repeatedly, on the topic of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Solid Snake/Gray Fox</a>, referring to Snake as "<em>Frank no ai</em>/Frank's love" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourGays">translated as "lovely" for the English Twitter feed</a>) and also calling Frank a "pervy masochist" who wants to get beaten up by him out of love. This was certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext">Subtext</a> in the original game, but seeing it confirmed so readily was unprecedented.

When Episode 6 rolled around, the creator made the fan design official.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>, it's stated once that the player character's hat has something written on it, but what this writing says is never revealed. When concept art of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">beta version</a> was released, fans noted that the protagonist's hat said "Curly Brace"&mdash;which was the character's name at that point in development. While, in the finished game the protagonist's name is something different&mdash;and Curly Brace is instead the name of an important <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>&mdash;fans insisted that his hat still said "Curly Brace" in the finished game. Daisuke Amaya eventually gave his blessing to that particular theory.
</li><li> Roleplayers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, having noticed that Caldari names looked like a cross between Finnish and Japanese, created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Caldari language</a> inspired by these two languages (and the few words already mentioned in official sources). The Arek'Jaalan event, whose main character &mdash; played by an actor from CCP's staff &mdash; is a Caldari scientist who defected to a Minmatar corporation, is named after said character's ship &mdash; which means "to make dissidents" in the Lonetrek dialect, also invented by players. Other roleplayer fanon to dribble into official articles or events includes discontent among the Intaki (a founding Gallente <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Federation</a> member) over cultural assimilation and poor security in their home region with nods to player-originated "Intaki Seperatist" movements.
</li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> compiled info on the series in a <em>Halo</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.halopedia.org/">wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> online. While wikis are good, they're not perfect. When the original edition of the official <em>Halo Encyclopedia</em> was released, it was clear that it had copied material directly from the wiki because it duplicated some of its errors and flawed ways of presenting information<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note155vg6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note155vg6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note155vg6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The wiki itself has since then corrected those errors, with the 2011 edition of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> following suit (partly; a few errors still remained)</span>. While almost all of the <em>Encyclopedia</em>'s errors, like the fleet at Reach being 750 ships instead of 314 and there being a First and Second Battle of Earth, were recognized as mistakes even by the very people responsible for publishing it in the first place, one bit of fanon that snuck in has managed to become official canonicity; the United Rebel Front, which originated as a misinterpretation of a one-line reference to a "united rebel front" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGhostsOfOnyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGhostsOfOnyx">Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</a></em>, was established as an official faction in later <em>Halo</em> media, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloNewBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloNewBlood">Halo: New Blood</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16hyuy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16hyuy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16hyuy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The official <em>Halo</em> website even has a nod to this; on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/universe/characters/colonel-watts">Colonel Watts's character page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it's noted that the name "United Rebel Front" originated as an unofficial designation</span>.

That Waddle Dee is the same from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbySuperStar">Kirby Super Star</a></em>, and he returned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JavelinThrower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JavelinThrower">playable character</a>, but his name was still "Waddle Dee" just like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">normal enemy</a>. That caused some confusions so many players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">started calling him Bandana Waddle Dee</a> (or Bandana Dee for shorts).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several gameplay-expanding functions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, such as the weapon modifications (which allow you to fit certain weapons with scopes, sights and expanded magazines), were directly adapted from fanmade game modules for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>. Interestingly, while the NV modifications only worked for a few of the weapons, the original designer went on to make <em>another</em> module for NV that provided a full three improvements for <em>every weapon in the game</em>. Including the DLCs and some more popular modules.
</li><li> The Scorched Sierra Power Armor first appeared in a PC mod, before the developers officially added it in the <em>Lonesome Road</em> DLC.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>'s Keychain likely drew inspiration from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderscrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderscrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>'s Keychain mod, which changed miscellaneous items being all in one place to grouping all the keys together.

The <em>Honest Hearts</em> DLC introduces a tribal named Two Bears High-Fiving as a Wild Wasteland encounter, and the staff has admitted that now, they can't help but see the picture that way.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> had Beta 1.8, the Adventure Update, leaked to the public early by mistake. Instead of trying to rectify the problem, Mojang decided to have pre-release versions of the next update revealed to the public from now on in the form of "snapshots". The results were twofold: players can get a sneak peek at new features and bug fixes while Mojang gets feedback from the players about the snapshot so they can fix whatever bugs there are before making the snapshot official.
<ul><li> The completely unused and unimplemented Pigman mob, which is important as it's the basis for the Zombie Pigman mob and inspiration for Villagers, was suggested by the user Miclee, who got rewarded with the Bacon Cape.
</li><li> There have been multiple instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> features being implemented into <em>Minecraft</em> throughout its history:
<ul><li> The very earliest, in Infdev, was the implementation of Scaevolus's Fast Renderer mod, increasing Minecraft performance.
</li><li> The first important implementation of a mod was the addition of the Region level format, the sole feature of another of Scaevolus's mods called McRegion, in Beta 1.3. This made a big change in performance, as the grouping of chunks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1761h0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1761h0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1761h0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">16*16*128, now 16*16*256, parts of the world. Blocks are grouped into them and the prior level format used a separate file for each chunk, which obviously added up to a lot of files</span> into 32x32 chunk "regions" decreased file sizes a lot and lowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">world gen</a> lag.
</li><li> The most well-known case occurred in Beta 1.7, where Hippoplatimus's Piston Mod was mostly implemented. This allowed Redstone to interact with the world in powerful ways, paving way for self-rebuilding walls, better cobblestone generators and other things. The one feature that was not implemented, the ability to launch entities and falling blocks into the air, was given in Minecraft 1.8 via slime blocks.
</li><li> A debatable case: Minecraft 1.5, the Redstone Update, introduced blocks made specifically for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation">Gameplay Automation</a>, most notably the Hopper, a simple item catcher and transporter, the Dropper, a Dispenser relative that only drops items without "using" any and can move them into inventories, including vertically, and the Comparator, a multi-purpose Redstone gate that can also sense the state of inventories nearby. This was the single biggest addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAutomation">Gameplay Automation</a> into the vanilla game, one that made mods no longer a necessity for many gameplay styles.
</li><li> The most recent case: Minecraft 1.6 implemented horses by Mojang's cooperation with Dr. Zhark, the maker of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoCreatures">Mo' Creatures</a></em>, a famous, complex and influential mod that adds extra animals, including horses. While the vanilla horses do not have all the features of the mod, such as supernatural breeds, the fact stands that horses are in vanilla and use Dr. Zhark's code. The same version brought another debatable case in the form of the new launcher, which allowed players to play old versions and switch Java parameters effortlessly thanks to the profiel system, similar to what custom launchers of the good old days like the Magic Launcher provided. In this case however, the old releases are efortlessly downloadable via the launcher and there's no need to scour the Internet for old JARs.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>beatmania IIDX</em> was originally titled "<em>beatmania II</em>," with a significantly more extravagant "deluxe" version of the arcade cabinet labeled "<em>beatmania II DX</em>". The DX cabinets were much more popular, to the point that Konami gave up on producing the non-DX cabinets. Combine that with the way the "II" and "DX" were close together on the logo, and everybody started calling the game "beatmania IIDX." It has since become the official name for the series.
</li><li> The Sudden+ option. Initially, some players would drape a towel over the screen to cover part of the note lanes, in order to force themselves to focus on only the most imminent notes. (There was already a "Sudden" option, which would cause notes to be invisible until about halfway down the screen, but it wasn't adjustable whereas a towel was.) This led to the introduction of Sudden+, which puts a static "Lane Cover" image on the screen covering just the top portion of the lane, and each player can individually adjust how much of the lane it covers. The image itself is also selectable from a few dozen options, most of which are based on songs in the game, but as of <em>IIDX 19: Lincle</em>, one of them is a towel.

</li><li> The boss song for <em>DDR Extreme</em> was originally rumored to be a 400 BPM song titled "Max To the XXXimum." There was a Stepmania fan remix with this title using sped-up segments from "Max 300," "Legend of MAX," and "Max Resurrexxion," another fan remix. Then came <em>DDR Supernova</em> with an official 400 BPM boss song titled "Fascination MAXX."

The new TP+ yachts, TS+ heavy transports, M2 superheavy destroyers, and M7C carrier-frigates all came from <em>Xtended</em>. The Stock Market mod became a base part of the game. EGOSOFT also wanted to use the completely revamped racial space stations introduced in <em>Xtended</em>, but were politely turned down as it would have made the mod largely irrelevant.

After she was given a full makeover, her previous appearance, including the signature Siren tattoos, were given to an antagonist, Commandant Steele. Fanon insisted that Steele was a Siren as well, and Gearbox Software ultimately agreed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not that it mattered much by the final boss.</span>
</li><li> The Commodore 64 version of <em>Jet Set Wily 2</em> was not only a way better version than the original on the ZX Spectrum, it also contained an island which you could visit at a certain time period.

As such, most of the books are completely ignored by the actual video game continuities (i.e. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em>, etc.). However, some of the elements from the novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlasterMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlasterMaster">Blaster Master</a></em> were incorporated in the PS1 sequel, <em>Blasting Again</em>, making it the only <em>Worlds of Power</em> novelization to be considered canonical.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">second game</a>, Imoen's class was officially changed to dual-classed thief/mage.

<ul><li> The enigmatic empty yellow animatronic suit resembling Freddy Fazbear was called the uninspiring "Yellow Bear" in the files, and unnamed in the game. Fans instead called it "Golden Freddy." The developer, Scott Cawthon, decided to go with it, and the custom A.I. screen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2">the second game</a> confirms Golden Freddy as the official name.
</li><li> The original game had a "Custom Night" where you can set the difficulty level of each animatronic. The highest difficulty was Level 20, and thus setting all four animatronics to 20 was known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">4/20 Mode</a>." When players began winning this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, the game's creator added a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> for beating it. In the second game's Custom Night, there were pre-made difficulty settings.

Finally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys4">fourth game</a> has no Custom Night, but it does have a secret "20/20/20/20" level.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>, the character of Clem originated from a <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/a/i0zW5">series of comics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about a Grineer soldier who wants to be just like the Tenno. Eventually, Clem was made into an actual character in the game and had a series of sidequests dedicated to him that had various nods to the original comics.
</li><li> For the longest time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> fans have theorized the post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">64</a></em> games take place in a tournament where Master Hand transported people from various universes to fight for him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Snake</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em> implied a tournament exists and trailers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">3DS/Wii U</a></em> on showing characters getting invitations all but confirmed it.

</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> games, those who got bored of the normal gameplay eventually started completing the missions in the default suit, with "Silent Assassin, Suit only" being often the hardest way to complete a level. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution">Hitman: Absolution</a></em> made completing a mission without changing the default outfit a challenge in most missions. Not only did the "suit only" challenge return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016">HITMAN (2016)</a></em>, the developers also made "Silent assassin, Suit Only" a challenge.
</li><li> According to the end credits of the twelfth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkParables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkParables">Dark Parables</a></em> game, the developers were inspired by a number of fanfic writers to make the pairing of Prince Gwyn and Gerda canon.
</li><li> Farseer Macha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> became very popular among <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer</a></em> fans, especially within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>'s /tg/ board, despite being a somewhat obscure character in the grand scheme of the franchise. She is fully armored in the game and her face is never seen; however fans on /tg/ began drawing fan art of her where she has long red hair and three red paint stripes on each of her cheeks. Much of said fan art was salacious in nature (as was also the case with the heaps of fan fiction), but none the less this particular character design stuck and the character's popularity endured. In 2016 ''Dawn of War III" was announced, and Macha returned as a hero character for the Eldar army sans helmet, sporting the exact look that she was given by the /tg/ community.
</li><li> The character "Fuze" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixSiege">Rainbow Six Siege</a></em> is listed in his character bio as having a strong moral compass. However, in game his cluster charge special ability is so powerful and unpredictable that it routinely massacres the hostage you are supposed to be saving or racks up team kills. This was so common in game that later DLC characters' bios note that Fuze is hard to work with due to a casual disregard for human life, and his own elite skin includes the phrase "Fuze the Hostage!" written on his machine gun.
</li><li> The now defunct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame">Mobile Phone Game</a> <em>Transformers Legends</em> utilized character descriptions from the wiki articles available on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWikiDotNet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWikiDotNet">TFWiki.net</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> fan artists came up with a tongue-in-cheek way of preventing/reverting Abigail Williams' transformation into her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">stripperiffic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> form, by applying a pair of crossed bandages over where her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdEye">Third Eye</a> appears.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune">Deltarune</a></em>, the follow up game to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> by Toby Fox, includes a particular bit of common fanon in its worldbuilding. The character of Asriel Dreemurr is one of the few characters in <em>Undertale</em> who doesn't receive any proper closure or a "happy ending" to his character arc, as opposed to practically every other main character in the game. This inspired many fanfics, comics, and entire alternate universe settings dedicated to correcting this perceived oversight and giving Asriel a happy ending as well. Flash forward three years and one of the first things the player learns in <em>Deltarune</em>&mdash;a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> featuring the characters from <em>Undertale</em> in similar roles and a different setting&mdash;is that Asriel is alive and well and happily attending university and due to arrive back home fairly soon. The player then spends the majority of the game with a character known by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">Significant Anagram</a> of "Ralsei", who fills a familiar role to Asriel's in <em>Deltarune</em>'s story, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">looks suspiciously similar to Asriel following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> at the end of Chapter 1</span>. He's even called "Azzy" by several characters, a name commonly given to him in fan works.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerRangersLegacyWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerRangersLegacyWars">Power Rangers: Legacy Wars</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerRangersBattleForTheGrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerRangersBattleForTheGrid">Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid</a></em>, by the same developer, both feature "Green Ranger V2", an armored version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">original Green Ranger</a> wielding the Sword of Darkness that originates from an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperPowerBeatDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperPowerBeatDown">Super Power Beat Down</a></em>.
</li><li> The boxart for the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> features the Doomguy armed with a rifle-type weapon that doesn't actually appear in game. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom">90s novelizations</a> incorporated that weapon into their take on the setting in the form of the Sig-Cow semi-auto assault rifle. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom">Brutal Doom</a></em> promptly followed suit by replacing the pistol completely with an assault rifle based on the Sig-Cow. These made such an impact that a machine gun was added into the Doomguy's arsenal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, with equivalents following in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal">Doom Eternal</a></em>.

As such, the wiki is essentially considered canon, as far as that applies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">such a series</a>. As an example: the wiki insisted on referring to the "Everybody to the Limit" robot as the "Visor Robot" in spite of the character having been referred to as the "Fhqwhgads Robot" by the site itself. The fanon name was later mistaken as canonical <em>by the creators themselves</em>, and was eventually adopted as its official name in-universe.

<ul><li> Fans of the show took the show-wide colour-theme-naming and ran with it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticShipNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticShipNaming">produce shipping names</a> based on each character's theme colour. In Volume 2, Ruby introduces tag-team combination attack moves, listing each pair involved in the relevant tactic by their shipping name, including Bumblebee (Yang (Yellow) and Blake (Black)) and Freezerburn (Weiss (white and uses Ice Powers) and Yang (Yellow and is associated with fire)). In Volume 3, Jaune unsuccessfully attempts to convince his team to use combination attacks that are also named after fandom pairing names, such as Arcos (Jaune and Pyrrha's surnames (Arc + "os" from Nikos)) and Flower Power (Ren, whose symbol is a flower, and Nora, who is based on Thor and therefore is the show's power-house fighter)).
</li><li> Volume 3 ends with Ruby, Jaune, Ren and Nora joining forces to travel across the continent of Anima together, searching for answers to who the villains are and what their plans are. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtranormalInstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtranormalInstitute">Huntsman Academies</a>, students work and graduate together as a team of four, with a colour-themed team name that is bestowed by the headmaster. As the four students came from two different teams, the fandom debated what new team name they should have for the future Volume 4 and settled on two possible options, with associated pros and cons: Team JNRR (Junior) or Team RNJR (Ranger). When Volume 4 started, the first episode opened to Ren, Nora and Jaune arguing about whether to call themselves Team JNRR or RNJR. Team JNRR initially wins due to Nora and Jaune favouring it, until Jaune decides it doesn't work when spoken aloud, making Team RNJR the default. At the end of Volume 5, Ruby officially calls them Team RNJR.
</li><li> A Reddit Q&amp;A held after the end of Volume 5 included a question about whether or not Qrow's weapon had a name. The creators admitted that the weapon didn't have a name until they spotted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> name "Harbinger"; they liked it enough to adopt it as the weapon's official name. Although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> name gained popularity due to crows being considered harbingers of misfortune and death, the creators only stated they adopted the name because they liked it.

Examples include:
<ul><li> "Mutie", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> given to the mutant kitten Rose found, became the <em>actual</em> nickname that Rose later gave it (short for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Vodka Mutini</a>".)

Hussie changed his mind on that last one, having said that logically Dave and Rose should have the same hair color. Since most fans don't agree with Rose being a redhead, they eventually mostly decided on either blonde or just blank white hair. Sometimes Dave gets strawberry blonde hair as a compromise.

</li><li> After the mysterious villain Lord English was finally revealed, someone made <a class="urllink" href="http://ib.skaia.net/post/view/22819">fanart of him<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the style of a classic monster movie poster. Then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jake English</span> was introduced, and the walls of his room were completely covered in movie posters&mdash;and that Lord English fanart was one of the posters.
</li><li> On <a class="urllink" href="http://mspandrew.tumblr.com/post/12680094125/answers">his tumblr<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Andrew Hussie (facetiously, we hope) declared that all fantrolls, ever, are now canonical.
<div class="indent"><strong>Q:</strong> Will another 12 alternate trolls be introduced? <br><strong>AH:</strong> ...How about if I introduce 10,000 new trolls? Watch this. <br>I hereby declare all of your fantrolls to be canonical. <br>Yes, even the shitty ones.
</div></li><li> Many of the Dancestors are parodies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">how the original trolls are written in fanfiction</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mspaforums.com/showthread.php?31279-Spades-Slick-Chat-XXXVII-Tesseract-confirmed-for-best-poster&amp;p=4016193&amp;viewfull=1#post4016193">On this post in the forum<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Hussie suggested that the Troll Empress could have survived the Vast Glub. The very next post in response? "In before she's recruited by Lord English as well." About a year later, that's exactly what happened. It's even funnier when a later post on that page discusses this trope.
</li><li> While Hussie is very fond of taking interesting fan theories and canonizing them, he is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a>, and just because a theory becomes canonical that doesn't mean it's going to happen in a way anyone expects. Case in point: UU. By Act 6 Act 3, the theory that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she wasn't actually a troll but just someone cosplaying was quite widespread, and no-one was too surprised when it became canonical. What <em>was</em> surprising was the fact that she was revealed to not be a human, either, but a <em>completely different species that was not revealed until that update</em>.</span> Well played, Hussie.
</li><li> The many sprites in the Ministrife were drawn by a fan with apparently pretty broad discretion, and so they included a number of nods to the fandom, particularly the canonization of the popular fanon that, under his helmet, Mituna has dandelion hair - thick, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair">Messy Hair</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs">covers his eyes</a>.
</li><li> The popular fan adventure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Promstuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Promstuck">Promstuck</a></em> contains a gag where Vriska shows John a spiral notebook containing her drawings, which she has <a class="urllink" href="http://blingee.com/">Blingeed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. John wonders how she was able to Blingee a spiral notebook. Much later on, in <em>Homestuck</em>, there is a scene where the Condesce gives Roxy a binder which is covered with gaudy animated gifs (some of them of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse">ICP</a>), and Roxy wonders how she was 'able to get the clowns to dance'.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005748">One page of the comic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> showed Karkat drawn at a very low resolution in such a way that made it look to some like he was wearing a pair of pants that went all the way up to his chest. People thought that was hilarious and began drawing him in that same way. Flash forward to when we learn about Karkat's ancestor, who is described as wearing "Righteous Leggings." Another troll says that she made his pre-scratch dancestor Kankri a red sweater because she couldn't bare to look at his ridiculous pants any longer.
</li><li> One of the early oddities of the fandom was a popular joke going around that Shrek was Eridan's father. There was fanart of it everywhere. Eventually the fandom moved on to newer memes and completely forgot about it. Years later, in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/collide.html">one of the most important flashes in the entire comic,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at around the 10:58 mark, you can see a doomed Eridan riding on the shoulders of his loving lusus Shrek, eating cotton candy. This is also the only time Eridan smiles in canonicity.
</li><li> At one point early in Act 6, Jane is shown to be in possession of a <em>Detective Pony</em> book which her friend Dirk has humorously defaced, with only a couple pages shown to the reader. One enterprising fan took it upon themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPalsDirkStriderEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPalsDirkStriderEdition">write a full version of the story</a>, which gained a substantial following and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">many imitators</a>, in particular the signature "meme rant". Years later, the comic's official follow-up, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck2">Homestuck^2</a></em> would officially make this version of the story canon, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terezi</span> even directly quoting the iconic line "Remember Longcat, Jane?"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freefall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freefall">Freefall</a></em> has <a class="urllink" href="http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff1500/fc01441.htm">Nickel's new legs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> When someone asked Mark Stanley what the FTL drive in his 'verse as called, he said "Dave." A fan suggested that this was a tongue-in-cheek acronym for "<strong>D</strong>angerous <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>V</strong>ery <strong>E</strong>xpensive", and Mark promptly declared it canonical.
</li><li> Mark also included a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to a popular <em>Freefall</em> fanfic. The fic featured another Bowman's wolf, Donna Morris, working as a hospital volunteer and hoping to become a nurse; Donna's name and occupation were made canonical in a casual remark by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doctor Bowman</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2010-02-02">one of the Q&amp;A strips<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em>, the author acknowledges <a class="urllink" href="http://elgoonishshive.wikia.com/wiki/El_Goonish_Shive_Timeline">a fan-made timeline<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the series and declares in the commentary that he considers it canonical.
</li><li> In one battle scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins">Goblins</a></em>, there was one goblin (who was somewhat fatter than the others) the fans named "Joe Chubbs", and started writing legends of him. While the author usually doesn't let himself be influenced by the fans, he decided to draw that goblin in other scenes, one of them featuring him as the only character for a few panels.
</li><li> A similar thing happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LookingForGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LookingForGroup">Looking for Group</a></em>, where a small girl zombie featured in a few strips gained a fandom and name of "Kalima", after the Kali god. When questioned on this at a convention, the artist Lar said (paraphrased) "Well, I guess if that many people say it, it must be true."

The Flash says "Running late. The Batmobile, it lost a wheel. The Joker got away. That's what I heard."
</li><li> Also in <em>Justice League</em>, the entire flirting between Batman and Wonder Woman came because of a scene in Gorilla Grodd's introduction episode, in which Batman, believing Wonder Woman was crushed by rubble, started digging with his hands. After escaping by herself, she saw Batman's hands covered in dirt and gave him a gratitude kiss in the cheek. Batman blushed at this, and fans believed there was something between them.

Apparently, this pony's face was supposed to have been blocked by another pony in front of her, but that pony was removed from the background in the final shot, thus exposing the odd face to the camera.</span>Fans quickly noticed and nicknamed this pony "Derpy Hooves". She quickly started getting scripted appearances, complete with crossed eyes. In the second season episode "The Last Roundup", both her name and the fanon personality (a klutzy but friendly mare) were briefly made canonical. She was made into a "Fashion Style"-sized toy as a 2012 San Diego Comic Con-exclusive, her box decorated with muffins (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">an obsessive fixation on muffins</a> being one of the most pervasive aspects of her fanon personality). She also made it into the second Fan Favorites set of normal-sized toys, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTropeFormerlyKnownAsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTropeFormerlyKnownAsX">with her name replaced by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyCharmsTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyCharmsTitle">a muffin symbol</a>. She's seen wearing a bag with a muffin clip on it when shopping in "Putting Your Hoof Down", then showed up twice in <em>Equestria Girls</em> both times holding a muffin. Also, while the comics had referenced it, it wasn't until "To Where And Back Again, Part 1" that show confirmed her job as a mailmare.
<ul><li> At this point, the only part of her fanon characterization to not make it into the show is her being the mother of Dinky, a background filly with a similar color scheme.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the background ponies with a lyre cutie mark was dubbed "Lyra" by the fans. When the fourth wave of blind bag toys were released, the pony with the same coloration and cutie mark was officially named "Heartstrings". The fans compromised by making "Heartstrings" her surname, and when the fifth wave of blind bag toys rolled around, the character was officially referred to as "Lyra Heartstrings".
</li><li> Lyra and another background pony, Bon Bon (or "Sweetie Drops", once trademark loss required that the name, seen in her earlier merchandise, be changed &mdash; though not the Gameloft game, strangely), were frequently paired together in crowd shots due to how their color schemes matched up, leading the fans to believe that the two are either inseparable best friends or romantic partners. So influential was this fan-interpretation that the Lyra/Bon Bon pairing is <strong>the</strong> most widely accepted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">ship</a> of the entire show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">by a long shot</a>). The famous 2011 Comic Con poster intentionally placed the two next to each other as a nod to this (and next year's Season 2 poster did likewise), and in Season 2 they were allotted their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Events</a> in "Secret of My Excess" and "Putting Your Hoof Down".

Finally, in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS9E23TheBigMacQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS9E23TheBigMacQuestion">The Big Mac Question</a>," the two of them engage in a simultaneous marriage proposal in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulBackgroundEvent">Meaningful Background Event</a>, giving the two of them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> and making them into a canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>.
</li><li> A similar case to Lyra's aforementioned renaming happened to minor antagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Trixie</a>. One of the blind bag glitter ponies bearing Trixie's color scheme and cutie mark was named "Lulamoon", presumably because the name Trixie couldn't be trademarked. Fans took it as either a last name or a stage name. The fifth wave of blind bags went with the former.
</li><li> The official pony trading cards refer to the mayor of Ponyville as "Mayor Mare", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> that had been used by the fans since the character's introduction.
</li><li> On the same card as Mayor Mare, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a>-esque pony referred to by fans as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Whooves</a> was given a name and background that tied into the fanon circulating around him: Time Turner, Ponyville's official timekeeper, responsible for maintaining the town clocks, running the timer for competitions, and all other things "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">timey-wimey</a>".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note219aj1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note219aj1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note219aj1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Yes, that last part is an explicit <em>Doctor Who</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>, and they actually put it on the card.)</span> And then in the official IDW comic book, he found his fob watch and got his memories back. He was later officially named Dr. Hooves (as with Trixie, the omission of the W at the beginning was almost certainly due to copyright/trademark anxiety), and played with the view that he's The Doctor regenerated as a pony (heck, they were even going to have David Tennant voice him). For what it's worth, given there was a point about it before the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary special shown in theaters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod">the BBC are totally fine with it</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of the cards, they also put fan-favorite pairing (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">platonic</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles">otherwise</a>) Octavia and Vinyl Scratch/DJ-PON3 on one, despite the two <em>never sharing an episode</em> prior to "Bloom and Gloom" (and that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>). As with Lyra and Bon Bon, Tavi and DJ get a major nod to their fan relationship in "Slice of Life": they live together, and their house is painted and decorated one way on one side and quite differently on the other, divided right down the middle in a way that brings to mind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMySide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMySide">This Is My Side</a> arguments seen in many a cartoon (hinting at a clash between their styles, though we don't see it in the same way as they do fanfics &mdash; in fact, Octavia asks Vinyl to help spice up her version of the wedding march.)
</li><li> One of the more bizarre examples of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> being made official was a sea serpent from the two-part pilot given the non-sequitur name "Steven Magnet" for his toy figure. The name originally came from, of all things, a screenshot of the character with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> Automatic Caption "steven magnet" below him (YouTube captions tend to be hilariously wrong and nonsensical at times).
</li><li> Fan-art often portrayed Wonderbolt stallion Soarin as having exact same cutie mark as he does with his flight suit on. This eventually became canonical in the season 2 finale where he can briefly be seen without it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">However, he receives a new cutie mark in Season 4.</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> from Season 3's "Magic Duel" is called the "Alicorn Amulet", referencing the fan name for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedUnicorn">Winged Unicorns</a> like Celestia and Luna. This was later confirmed by the season 3 finale, which uses the term "alicorn" to refer to such winged unicorns.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E6SleeplessInPonyville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E6SleeplessInPonyville">Sleepless in Ponyville</a>" rendered two long-standing fan theories canonical: the first being that Scootaloo views Rainbow Dash as a big sister figure, and the second being that Luna is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWalker">Dream Walker</a> who protects people from nightmares.
</li><li> Fans had repeatedly commented on how young pegasus pony Scootaloo never flies on-screen, some wondering if she could at all. In second-season episode "Ponyville Confidential", a nod was made to this where she frantically flaps her wings while falling out of a tree, but still lands in the mud. Eventually, "Sleepless in Ponyville" shows her in real danger due to not being able to fly, and the fourth-season episode "Flight to the Finish" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">said outright that she's not able to fly, and treated this as a disability</a>.

When he was destroyed by the Crystal Heart, his horn could be seen flying out of the detonation, giving rise to the popular speculation that he could regenerate his body <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">from his horn</a> despite claims by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that Sombra was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. His official trading card has come out mentions that his horn's survival could lead to the possibility of an eventual return from him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Sombra did eventually return in the Season 9 premiere, but it had nothing to do with his horn. Even then, he was vaporized completely after his resurrection, meaning Sombra is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a> now.</span>

In this episode, our villain does just that.

</li><li> Earth Ponies being stronger than the other two tribes was a piece of fanon so common that it was near-universally accepted. There had always been things such as <em>only</em> earth ponies plowing snow in "Winter Wrap Up", or Cheerilee and Ms. Peachbottom's <em>epic</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">Juggernaut</a> moments in "Hearts and Hooves Day" and "Games Ponies Play", respectively, and Big Mac and Maud's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of <em>insane</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>. Celestia confirms this as canonical when she mentions that "without their strength" (drained by Tirek) they would not be able to tend the land.
</li></ul></li><li> Several fan works portrayed Octavia Melody and Vinyl Scratch/DJ-PON3 as roommates. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerDeckEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowerDeckEpisode">Lower-Deck Episode</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E9SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E9SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>" made that official by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Rhpvx58iq00">showing them sharing the same house<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Also, it established that Octavia speaks with a British accent.
</li><li> In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E15ScareMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS5E15ScareMaster">Scare Master</a>", Fluttershy has pony versions of various anime characters hanging from her ceiling, leading to some fans thinking she's an anime fan. A trading card makes reference to this, even mentioning a few other well known anime characters as well. An issue in the official MLP comic series even depicts her as an artist with a booth at an anime convention.
</li><li> One of the most direct examples would have to be "Keep Calm and Flutter On", whose basic premise was created by one of the fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">who then worked with Meghan on the script</a>.
</li><li> Fans had mused over the possibility that not all of the Pinkie clones from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E3TooManyPinkiePies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS3E3TooManyPinkiePies">"Too Many Pinkie Pies"</a> were found. When Pinkie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">alludes to this episode</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E10TheSaddleRowReview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E10TheSaddleRowReview">"The Saddle Row Review"</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://derpiboo.ru/1159260">we see one of the clones looking over her shoulder<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The seventeenth wave of blind bags in 2016 finally made the fan nickname "Cloud Kicker" official for the blonde-maned lavender pegasus.
</li><li> The changelings being true bug ponies with a hive, being born as grubs, etc. All made canonical via Thorax's flashback in "The Times They Are A Changeling" and delved deeper into during the finale, "To Where and Back Again (Part 2)"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">Hippogriff</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">Original Characters</a> and shippings between ponies and griffons are reasonably common in the fandom. Hippogriffs were formally introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017">My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)</a></em>, and hippogriff characters were introduced to the show proper in season eight. (They clearly aren't what you get when a pony and a griffon love each other very much, though.)
</li><li> Similarly, Kirins are now a thing, though they're not dragon/pony offspring.
</li><li> Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich is a popular ship because of their similarities and excellent chemistry. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS9E26TheLastProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS9E26TheLastProblem">The Last Problem</a>" reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">they got married</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">had a son</a> together</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> It was a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a> theory for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> that Ginger, the Asian Fireside Girl, was Stacy's little sister (probably due to there not being too many other Asian people in Danville). The season 4 premiere "For Your Ice Only" officially made this the case.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> there was no evidence supporting anything but typical friendship between cast members, but this didn't stop the wide portrayals of certain characters as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interests</a>, mainly Fred and Daphne in the late 60s and early 70s, and then in contrast between Daphne and Shaggy in the 80s. But at no point was any of the franchise really presenting love interests until Shaggy's tussles in the Superstars 10 films. From then on the general stance became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>, and by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> such relationship hints became a part of the plot. And <em>Scooby Doo Stage Fright</em> turns it back into a subplot and throws it back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> in the very next film.
</li><li> A theory among <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> was Sideshow Bob's up-and-down bouts of mania being attributed to a heart condition. This ended up becoming a plot point of sorts in a Season 19 episode, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a vial of his nitroglycerin medication is thrown out a window and he subsequently "dies"</span>.
</li><li> Craig and Tweek were a popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> pair for years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipsThatPassInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipsThatPassInTheNight">despite little interaction</a> between the two. The writers took note in a 2015 episode where they poke fun at yaoi fangirls and have the kids complain about the ship. And then they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">canonized</a> the couple.
<ul><li> "Carol" was a popular fanon name for Kenny's mom, as it had been used for several other moms before they each got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenNameChange">Sudden Name Change</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a></em> makes this official.

<ul><li> Upon his introduction into the show early in season 2, fans took note of Captain Rex's resemblance to one of the members of the Rebel strike team in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> and decided that was him.

However, they ultimately didn't go through with it.
</li><li> The episode Empire Day establishes that the Imperial March is the Empire's national anthem.
</li></ul></li><li> While most fanon for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em> remains only that, the concept of Lord Stingray being yellow-skinned seems to have been referenced by the colorists for the season 4 premiere (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">though he was previously visually implied to be a generic white guy</a>). The yellow skin used by fan artists was either utilized to depict him as a mutant, or used as a placeholder color due to him not having been seen outside his uniform at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Raven and Beast Boy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> were supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> and wouldn't work well together. Despite this, it is one of <em>the</em> biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan Preferred Couples</a> in western animation and it is widely considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a>, with many fanworks depicting at least a one-sided crush between the two. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> completely embraces the idea, however. Beast Boy openly flirts with Raven, Raven has a canonical crush on him, and they've had a few episodes focused on them. Beast Boy's canonical love interest Terra pops up, but has been given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> treatment to be more in-line with her comic version: originally loathing and exploiting him but eventually warming up to him. Still, she is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">'Betty' to Raven's 'Veronica'</a> and BBRae is given much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>.

Not only does he appear a lot more in the third season, the show's official blog refers to him as "Billy".

Though he was just being theatric, fan use of the name led to the name being used for the BotCon 2006 (convention run by the officially Hasbro-licensed fan club) exclusive toys and the accompanying comic book (as Darks<em>y</em>de), and thus the official name.
</li><li> Rhinox's chainguns, most famously used in the first season episode <em>Chain of Command</em>. The unofficial name given to them by the fandom was "Chainguns O' DOOM" and the phrase eventually appeared on Rhinox's bio cards in later toy releases.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, Marty Isenberg liked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> for Lugnut's exploding-rocket-fist-thing ("Punch of Kill Everything") so much he had the name used in the fourth issue of the comics. Supposedly, he tried to use it in the show, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">Never Say "Die"</a> reared its ugly head, and no other word really worked there (with the possible exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">"Krush"</a>) to make it abbreviate to POKE.
</li><li> The POKE appears again, with its proper name and everything, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron">Transformers: War for Cybertron</a></em>; a special move damage upgrade for the Soldier class is called "POKE Alpha", and one of the Leader class's killstreak rewards is the "POKE 2.0", a temporary one-hit-kill melee attack that, when equipped, will prompt the announcer to say, "Punch of Kill Everything equipped!".
</li><li> Many fan terms from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a> became official canonicity over the years. The term "Seekers" for the Decepticon jets (taken from of all things, a toy flyer from 1984), "gestalt" as a catch-all term for combiners (much better than their at-the-time only canonical name from the comcis "fusilateral quintocombiners") and the concept of subspace to explain size changes, suddenly appearing weapons and trailers, etc. have all popped up in official stories.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Breakdown and Knock Out</a> were shipped together a whole bunch after their debut. They never managed to get together in the show but appeared as a couple in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersWindblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersWindblade">The Transformers: Windblade</a></em>.

<ul><li> This is usually how words change meaning. Enough people start using it the wrong way that it becomes the new definition. This is also sometimes why words have silent letters: enough people slur the word when pronouncing it (typically because saying it with the silent letter is difficult e.g try pronouncing "listen" with the T not silent) that the wrong pronunciation becomes accepted, and since spelling is more permanent, and thus slower to change, than pronunciation the extra letters remain.
