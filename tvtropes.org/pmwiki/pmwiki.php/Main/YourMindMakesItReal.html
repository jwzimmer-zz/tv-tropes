</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>You'd think that it all being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">just a dream</a> would let you do lots of cool and risky things since it's not real anyway, and therefore you can't get hurt.
</p><p>Not so.
</p><p>There's an old wives' tale which claims that if you die in a dream, you die for real. Although a potential mechanism is suggested in "Real Life" below, it remains not exactly clear how anyone could have determined this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">since the only witness would be unable to confirm it</a> (unless you believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpookySeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpookySeance">spiritualism and he contacted you from the next life</a>). Yet it persists, and a lot of people believe it.
</p><p>So, if you're in a dream, hallucination, or VR simulation, death can be <em>plenty</em> lethal. By extension, if you're a hacker in a high-tech futuristic world where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace">Cyberspace</a> is navigated through a realistic simulation, intrusion countermeasures can kill you dead. To be fair, certain depictions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace">Cyberspace</a> require users to link their brains to the network electronically, which would provide a relatively obvious threat to incautious intruders. However, even hackers who operate in worlds without such dangers may be vulnerable to seizure-inducing graphics.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Often, fictional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberspace">cyberspace</a> ICE (intruder countermeasure electronics) is said to work by channeling lethal voltages into the brain of the invading hacker, but it seems that any techhead with even an ounce of common sense would put at least one fuse, circuit breaker, or voltage regulator on any line connected directly to his brain. Presumably, most users do not know about such things, given their willingness to use an interface that could turn them into a vegetable or corpse at a moment's notice. Authors who put a little more thought into the matter may come up with some variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">motif of harmful sensation</a>, implying there's some kind of malicious out-of-band signal which triggers a nasty (usually fatal) seizure in its victims or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveInstrumentation">blows up their computer</a>.
</p><p>As for the rest? Let us be very clear: there is no obvious or immediately compelling reason that dying in a dream or hallucination would actually kill you, unless you are <em>really</em> gullible and you live in a world where the Nocebo Effect is <strong>much</strong> more powerful than it is in real life. Obviously, magic spells can do as they like, but the only reason that you would be actually harmed by dying in a VR simulation would be if the VR simulator was intentionally and specifically designed to murder the operator. This makes sense if it's part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">insofar as a death trap ever makes sense</a>), but usually this is some commercial, publicly-available system, often with no stated purpose beyond simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinToExit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinToExit">playing games</a></em>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>As an extension, perhaps to justify this trope, such systems often propose that the user's mind actually <em>is</em> inside the machine, having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">literally downloaded</a> out of his physical brain. Thus, destroying the machine would leave the user's body comatose &mdash; but destroying the physical body might leave the mind intact to have a go at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">possessing someone else</a>.
</p><p>An increasingly common justification of this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">Synchronization</a>; directly wiring your brain to the machine gives you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath">Technopathic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Power at a Price</a> of a potentially-fried brain. Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a> games &#151; such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> &#151; use this justification, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> it with alternative safer but far-less effective interfaces which someone risking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface">Brain&#150;Computer Interface</a> can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">destroy with ease</a>.
</p><p>This tends to apply to video game levels that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> or a virtual reality simulation as a function of gameplay: If your character dies, it's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>.
</p><p>When you are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInYourDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInYourDreams">Talking in Your Dreams</a> with someone else and they go to kill you &#151; this may come into play. This may also come into play if, in a dream, a character dies, and that character dies in real life, however, this would be an overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImNotAfraidOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImNotAfraidOfYou">I'm Not Afraid of You</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">Master of Illusion</a> might use this principle to make their illusions harm victims, like making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdFlames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdFlames">Cold Flames</a> actually burn.
</p><p>Note that if you're talking about the mind making things literally real <em>in general</em>, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>, not this. This trope is only about the dying.

In other words, whatever they imagine exists, exists. Ergo: Your mind makes it real.
</li><li> The series <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr_Force_Exe">BALDR Force .exe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> is based around this concept.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess">Scrapped Princess</a></em>, when the titular character enters a VR program to save her brother from being brainwashed, only to be promptly impaled by him when he fails to recognize her. There is a moment of shock, and then she slaps him in the face and continues to shout at him with his sword still stuck through her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetBackers">Get Backers</a></em> is fond of this trope, and used it in the IL and Divine Design arcs.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack series</a>, characters hit by the <em>Data Drain</em> attack within <em>The World</em> are usually sent into a coma in the real world, and are temporarily knocked unconscious at the very least.
<ul><li> Some characters eventually realize that somehow their minds are taken <em>inside</em> the game world, experiencing it with their character's own senses instead of being at home with a headset and game pad. Naturally, they become deeply concerned about what's going on with their physical bodies, and what happens if their characters are "killed" in this state.
</li><li> There's a bit of question in regards to whether the player stuck in the game and the coma victim are related in that manner. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has dropped that the original coma victims were placed in a coma due to noise affecting their mental state, placing their reliance of the physical body explainable only under the conceit that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">Everything Is Online</a>. In the latter anime and game series, ROOTS and G.U., the danger is a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">viral <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareBody">Wetware Body</a> existence that uses Harald's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">original human observation algorithms</a> to affect the mind directly</span>.

In short, enough willpower on the target's part renders the technique void.

Although he tells everyone to be careful in spite of this new development it doesn't sink in with Tai, the goggle boy leader of the group, and he starts acting like a jackass under the flawed logic that he'll somehow survive regardless of what happens. It takes Izzy telling him that he would more than likely die in both worlds if he messed up to put a stop to his nonsense. Unfortunately, this happens just after a member of the team is kidnapped and they're about to cross an electrified gate to go after her. He loses his bravado right there and the kidnapper gets away more or less scott-free, leading to a short term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> for Tai.

It all boils down to belief. When there is enough belief in something (through numbers and/or intensity), it manifests. Such as with Lil' Slugger/Shounen Bat.

Eventually, the late episodes show the manifestation of imagination beginning to intensify: Ikari's "ideal world" and Maniwa's half-crazed journey to discover Lil' Slugger's origins (the line blurs here because, despite them seemingly being delusions, he learns real facts).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Rojuro "Rose" Otoribashi's Bankai generates music that causes the listener to experience illusions.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers">Gundam Build Divers</a></em>, Tigerwolf tells Riku and Yukki that, since GBN is a virtual world, they run no risk of actually getting hurt and, with practice, can achieve great feats. Since they're newbies to game, though, it doesn't sink in immediately and it takes a few reminders throughout the series to understand that.

It is initially stated that if you die during a Lifelight "jump", you simply wake up from it. However, once the Reality Bug is introduced into Lifelight in an attempt to make it less perfect and addicting, this trope gets taken to absurd levels. Not only do you die in real life if you die during a jump, but any injuries you get appear on your real body, even <em>damaging your clothing</em>. And after the Reality Bug manifests in a jump as a giant shape shifting monster, it is somehow able to enter physical reality by burrowing down through the ground.

Holbrook notes that Faulks had started to have an increasingly vivid recurring dream, such that smell and tactile sensation emerged. It appears that the personages in Faulk's dream (such as a woman named Dawn Winter) had started to manifest in the waking world. Templar notices curious phenomenon which seem to support Holbrook's claim: Simon sees his own reflection fine in a small mirror, but Dawn's features are "blurred, run together, an amorphous mass"; when every single character repeats the same cluster of honorific catch phrases when they first meet the Saint; and the phenomenon of time compression that Holbrook identifies as an aspect of dream (a group of thugs searching for Holbrook and Winter say they will travel a long distance to fetch their boss from the town return in less than thirty minutes). Though one of the thugs opens fire on Templar, he has no wounds in the morning. However, when he visits Glendale, California to look up Andrew Faulks, Faulks has died after slipping into a coma.

It was later discovered that the only one of the six known Primes that did have that condition was Siglen, who had an inner ear condition that really did cause her to fall ill. Siglen's giant ego ascribed this to "the burden Primes must bear for their power," rather than have herself checked out. Since Siglen trained or trained with all the rest of the Primes, she mentally pushed her condition on the rest. The Rowan was the only one of the original five young enough to train herself past her conditioning. And then, preferred staying on her home base of Io, Jupiter's moon, unless she had to travel.

He pays an exorbitant sum to an acquaintance of his to sign him up for the game. However, playing the game requires an implant that allows the simulation to be extremely realistic. Luckily for Xander, he had a similar experimental implant put in him a few years ago in his thirst for greater realism in games. After logging into the <em>Phantom Server</em>, he finds out that the game might as well be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, if real life had players in a remote, hostile star system with dangerous enemies. Any pain Xander's character experiences, Xander feels too, thanks to the implant. In addition, certain locations or states automatically disable the logout button, so he can't even cut the connection if things get too hot to handle. Now, the company developing the game makes sure that every player's physical body is plugged into a life support system, so they can't starve or die of thirst. Still, Xander starts finding bodies of people he initially assumes to be NPCs, except they don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades">fade</a> and actually undergo a realistic decomposition process. He realizes that the sheer realism of the game, coupled with the pain might very well result in player deaths. He recalls his acquaintance telling him that many gamers went into the game, but few came out. Back then, Xander dismissed the warning, assuming the game was simply so cool that no one wanted to leave. Now he realizes people may have been actually dying in the game. There's also the very real threat of going insane, especially in certain locations that continually kill and respawn players, only to kill them (very painfully) mere minutes (or even seconds) later. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then alpha testing ends, and the developers decide to remove any testers, who are still alive and sane (i.e. haven't turned into NPCs), as witnesses.</span>

At some points, individuals manage to temporarily see through the illusion to the more mundane reality beneath. However, when everybody present agrees that a thing is happening, and it's convincing enough that people die because they believe they've been killed, the distinction is largely moot, and Jago poses a genuine threat.

In a number of episodes, it's shown that if Chuck isn't aware of a source of electricity, he doesn't suffer his symptoms because he doesn't realize he's supposed to be doing so. Much of the reason he sticks so fervently to this is that he doesn't want to be seen as "crazy"; he would rather be though of as laid low by an incurable illness than a mental disorder, so he lies to himself and refuses to see treatment or diagnosis for his condition, even though it's clearly not what he claims it to be.

Price later demonstrates his ability to the other people in Big Bob's diner when he makes a T-bone steak appear on the counter. He says that he has met four other vets with the same ability and that one of them speculated that their powers are as a result of being sprayed with a strange Soviet chemical by the Viet Cong.

These spells create illusory constructs or facsimiles of spells from other schools, and have reduced effects on characters that successfully "disbelieve" them. Naturally, they always have this reduced effect on objects and creatures with low intelligence, such as constructs.
<ul><li> Some Phantasm spells, such as <em>Phantasmal Killer</em> and <em>Weird</em>, make you save or die upon failing the roll to disbelieve, doing nasty damage even on success. Annoyingly, <em>Death Ward</em>, which protects against other spells that make you save or die, won't protect you against this because it's an illusion based on fear, since <em>Death Ward</em> protects only against direct, external magical energies that cause death, while these illusions essentially rely on tricking the target into killing itself. 5th edition alters both so that, while they're not instant death, their torment lasts longer, Frightening the target(s) and damaging at the end of each round until it's over or they <em>finally</em> make their save to disbelieve it.
</li><li> One of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> game modules had the player characters travel into a living nightmare to end its hold over an elven kingdom. Many of the monsters the players encounter are in fact creations of the dream, and can be made harmless if players state they don't believe in them. Unfortunately, quite a few of those monsters are very real, and will attack the players anyway, and it's very difficult to tell the difference.
</li><li> Some D&amp;D-based literature describes the physical threat of illusions. <em>Trollshead</em> (in The Dragon, #31), describes how some people ran through the illusion while others were burned alive and left charred.
</li><li> The psionic powers "Recall Agony" and "Recall Death" cause the target to see into the future &mdash; specifically, to witness a possible future in which the target dies horribly. This can cause the target to die horribly.

Under normal circumstance, attacks in the Astral Realms don't harm health, but instead reduce Willpower (a person's reserve of mental and emotional strength). If a person loses all of their Willpower (not necessarily from being attacked) they return to the waking world, unable to maintain their Astral self and completely emotionally drained, but otherwise unharmed. There are however ways in which the person can be damaged or destroyed <em>mentally</em>. For example, being attacked by an ideology until the person's identity is completely buried beneath fanaticism, being drawn into the hold of an insanity realm until one's personality is utterly destroyed from that insanity, or going to the Dreamtime unprotected, where one's mind will be completely washed away by a consciousness which is incompressible to and uninterested in human perspective or individuality (essentially, your sense of identity is lost among the thoughts of something which has existed before there was life). In these cases, the body becomes a completely healthy vegetable. There are also beings capable of inflicting actual damage from the Astral Realms, though this is more to do with magically being able to target your body directly rather than because Their Mind Makes It Real.

When two characters meet while Dreaming any combat between them is usually harmless - any character who is knocked unconscious or killed just wakes up.

The Ripper's ability takes the form of a "software rewrite" of the victim's "brain software": the hormonal and electrical layers of the human brain. When triggered (through use of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a> telephone call), the fluid and air pressure within the victim increases rapidly causing them to violently explode. The protagonist has to have his own "software" modified with an immunisation so that the Ripper can't use the "long range doohicky" any longer (he is still vulnerable if the Ripper chooses to attack him "face to face" in the virtual world). <br><br>Later, the Ripper calls all of the surviving characters into the virtual world, and demands the protagonist choose who they think it is. The protagonist at this point has armed himself with a single-use "virtual weapon" in the form of a pulsing orb of energy. Each of the characters make their case to the player, and the player must use the virtual weapon on the character they think is the Ripper, presumably killing them, as the ending narration is spoken in the past tense. Choose badly and not only have you killed an innocent person, the Ripper attacks the protagonist directly and kills him as well.

Especially odd since it's not virtual reality. I assume the computer interface is just that realistic. On the other hand, you <em>are</em> standing right next to whatever thing you're trying to hack and, in fact, probably touching it, so it could just be zapping you. Also, doors mostly just increase their security, and supply crates will break or explode as retaliation, and enemies mostly just realize you're standing there and stop standing around in a peaceful manner. And maximizing your crack level removes all harmful effects of failure.

Whether this is an intentional feature of the system or whether it is a side-effect of the time-projection technology is never stated. Late in the game, the player learns of an arguable inversion: characters crashed by the player are, due to the player's unorthodox presence in the system, misread by the controlling AI as having been disconnected from the game; the AI then responds by shutting off life support. Thus, characters crashed by the player die because the AI's mind makes it real.

<ul><li> Certain Indigenous Australian tribes have a death curse for criminals that involves wrapping a piece of the cursed person's hair around a kangaroo bone and performing rituals over it. A special shaman hunter then finds the person and points the bone at them.
<ul><li> Similar claims have been made of some believers of Vodoun in Haiti and Africa. It is believed by some that Christianity has affected some people strongly enough to cause psychosomatic stigmata to form on their palms, as well (the real wounds of crucifixion would be on the wrists, by the way).
</li><li> It's no coincidence that two of the most common "curses" which folklore alleges can be inflicted via supernatural means are "breath stealing" and impotency. Directed against someone with even a minor predisposition to allergies, asthma, or an active respiratory infection, the sheer anxiety of <em>believing</em> their breath has been "stolen" could bring on an attack of breathing difficulty. Likewise, performance-anxieties exacerbated by an impotency "curse" may impair a male believer's capacity to relax, to such a degree that the parasympathetic reflexes of erection can't take place.
</li></ul></li><li> Hypnotic suggestions work this way. It is possible for somebody in a deep hypnotic trance to feel things that are not present, which leads to some real-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">Power Perversion Potential</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect">Placebo Effect</a>. Believing that you are taking medicine causes you to experience a reduction in symptoms and occasionally the cause of the symptoms. It bears mentioning that Placebos seem to have something like a 60% effectiveness rate. Even on <em>cancer</em>.
<ul><li> One anecdote is that a nurse in World War II had run out of morphine and had to stabilize a wounded soldier to keep him from going into shock. She filled a syringe with saline (salt water) and injected it in, telling the soldier it was morphine. <em>It worked.</em>
<ul><li> Of course, they can't replace real medicine; their best use is for alleviating the pain of recovery. Sadly, this would need your doctor telling you that the sugar pills he's giving you are a miracle drug and not sugar pills, which is completely unethical. (If this concept sounds familiar it's because you saw it in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>.)
</li></ul></li><li> There is also its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>, the Nocebo Effect, which works exactly the same as the Placebo Effect except with things the patient believes will make them <em>worse</em>. For example, in double-blind studies, patients given what they told was anti-cancer medication tended to have their hair fall out... even if the medication in question was sugar.
</li></ul></li><li> Conversely, the opposite effect can occur when someone suffers from extreme depression, or complete loss of hope. Someone with failing health could increase their lifespan and quality of life if they believed something that gave them hope (not just "a positive attitude"), but those without hope will often succumb to their ailments, especially if they have been dealing with them for a long time. Teddy Roosevelt was considered to be the pinnacle of stubborn toughness, but when his son died, he fell into despair and died shortly after.
<ul><li> A study of cancer patients showed that in many cases where the prognosis was presented in a negative way, some patients simply gave up and lost hope. These patients tended to succumb much more quickly, in some cases well <em>before</em> the disease had progressed enough to be able to kill a person on its own.
</li><li> On the flipside, this "positive-attitude cures you" claim is often used as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming">excuse</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">shame a patient for voicing their discomfort and displeasure</a> and admonishing them to stop wallowing in "self-pity". Barbara Ehrenreich has written a book about the misuse of positive thinking, especially where it concerns cancer: it's called <em>Bright-Sided</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Applied in the theological theory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pandeism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pandeism">Pandeism</a>: miracles and revelations occur not because a God is watching over us and intervening, but because the Universe-creating entity has become us (and the rest of the Universe) and believers in any religion are able to unwittingly tap into their own little bit of Creator-power.
</li><li> It doesn't actually <em>make it real</em>, but this is the belief for many sufferers of OCD, who have intrusive thoughts that if they don't perform actions and rituals terrible things are going to happen. They don't nor ever will happen, but the sufferer can believe that their brain's belief will make it real, so they do it just to be safe.
<ul><li> It's important to note that a defining characteristic of OCD is that the sufferer <em>fully realizes that his or her compulsions have no actual effect</em>; no one with OCD actually believes that, for instance, washing their hands one hundred times is more effective than washing them once. Nor do they actually believe that something terrible will happen if they don't touch every surface in their room. Part of what makes OCD so painful is that the person is perfectly aware that what they're doing is totally irrational - but they feel compelled to do it anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In general, it's been proven that we're pretty easy to fool in this regard. A newer type of prosthetic limb channels physical feedback from the prosthetic to the stump. It doesn't take long for your mind to associate that stimulation with your prosthetic to the point that it feels like your actual limb. Also, VR can make you think a virtual image or a displaced image of something else is your real body. Our brains are built ready for cybernetic upgrades.
<ul><li> And for the matter, unrelated studies and effects can offer interesting insight in to how much our brain fools us. During one brain surgery, one patient felt the presence of a non-existent person 'nearby'. Follow up tests/cases shows that a part of the brain responsible for the sense of personal location within 3d space was being triggered and manipulated resulting in people sensing and seeing what amounts to classical depictions of dopplegangers.
</li><li> In another case, scientists found that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">low frequency sounds triggered feelings of dread, fear, and the sensation of other somethings in the room (ie typical 'signs' of ghosts)</a>. In this case, one likely justification for why this might be is because this frequency range also happens to be the same range at which many large predators growl at. Another possibility is the low frequencies represent hints of rumbling: in other words, something very big (and probably very dangerous) approaching&mdash;like a stampede, an avalanche, et al.

</li></ul></li><li> It's been suggested that Grigori Rasputin, the Russian monk who gained access to the court of the Russian Empire by supposedly being able to treat the Tsar's hemophiliac son, hypnotized the boy to "cure" him whenever he was injured. Rasputin's hypnotic powers were in fact recounted by others, even hardened men like some of the Tsar's ministers. Either Peter Stolypin or Sergius Witte who later recounted Rasputin's attempt to hypnotize him, which was very nearly successful.
<ul><li> Rasputin's treatment of hemophilia is now believed to be far simpler than hypnotism: he told the Tsar to give up the modern medicine with his son's case, which at the time included dangerous amounts of aspirin, which today is known to actually make the effects of hemophilia worse. No wonder the boy got better.

One of the earliest diagnosed Somatoform Disorders is "Conversion Disorder", which causes a person's psychological stresses to be converted into physical pain.
<ul><li> The evidence for conversion needs to be re-examined. It was originally based on preconceived notions about women and about VD.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0npri');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0npri" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0npri');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Syphilis has a stage with lesions, then goes dormant for decades before re-emerging, causing insanity. Doctors didn't know this and thought you were cured when the lesions disappeared. A young man might catch it from a prostitute, years later pass it to his wife and of course "good people" didn't talk about this stuff. Creators who went insane due to this may have contributed to the perceived "link between creativity and madness" since no one knew it was VD.</span> With no penicillin yet, doctors routinely prescribed <em>mercury</em> not just as a cure but a preventative. Mercury causes serious neurological damage including off-and-on paralysis, heart palpitations, deafness, blindness and pain. After Freud, doctors could now write those off as "hysteria". Hysteria became a garbage-can diagnosis; even a plain old orgasm was called a "<a class="urllink" href="https://jezebel.com/5914350/vibrators-and-clitoridectomies-how-victorian-doctors-took-control-of-womens-orgasms">hysterical paroxysm<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>".
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted with trauma shock (albeit temporarily), where your mind's refusal to consciously accept that you've just been torn to bits keeps the pain at bay until you either pass out or cool down a bit.
<ul><li> Rather, your brain has accepted the fact that you are injured, but it also realizes that whatever it is doing right now is more important to your survival, and so it starts producing painkilling neurotransmitters until what you are doing is finished.

</li><li> Essentially the idea behind "psychosomatic symptoms". Again, a number of illnesses have been written off as this, then found to be real as medical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>.
</li><li> Sounds and smells don't actually exist in nature. Sounds are compression waves moving through a medium at various wavelengths and frequencies, while smells come from airborne molecules of a particular substance that are drawn into our nostrils. Their interactions with our brains are all that make them what they are. In short, sounds and smells refer to our perceptions of stimuli, rather than actual physical things. Which technically means that a tree falling in a forest wouldn't make a sound if no one was around to hear it, nor would it make a sound even if someone WAS around to hear it.
<ul><li> Likewise, the color magenta doesn't exist as a wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum: it's purely an artifact of how our brains interpret a mixture of the low-frequency and high-frequency ends of the visible light range.
</li><li> This applies to colors in general. What we think of as an object's color is, in fact, the part of the visible electromagnetic spectrum that the object <em>doesn't</em> absorb from the ambient light (white means the object reflects all light, black means it absorbs all light, reflecting nothing). In fact, each brain processes colors differently, so no two people see the same color exactly the same (although, most can, at least, agree that green is green, unless they're colorblind). It's possible for a skilled hypnotist to confuse someone's brain and shift the color perception, resulting in that person perceiving yellow as red, for example, and red as black. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown">Derren Brown</a> has done this to a student once, resulting in her wondering who re-painted her car, while her friends look at her in confusion.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex">Guilt complexes</a> can work like this. A person can experience feelings of guilt and remorse despite not having actually done anything (free-floating guilt). Rather than actual actions, these feelings could come from the thought of doing something wrong, like briefly fantasizing about someone else when you're already in a relationship. It could also come from shame over living a better life than someone less fortunate (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt">or just living at all</a>) and feeling like you haven't done enough to help others. Once your mind makes it real, the guilt is able to feed off itself and create a cycle of negative, irrational thinking.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgellons">Morgellons phenomena<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has been listed by some experts as a disease that is spread through the Internet. Essentially it's a form of delusional parasitosis<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ol80');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1ol80" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ol80');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a delusional disorder in which victims believe they are infected by parasites, usually accompanied by hallucinated physical effects.</span> in which alleged sufferers claim to be infested with strange, organic fibers. Upon medical examination, it's almost always revealed these fibers are synthetic and the sores they complain about are the result of compulsive scratching; the catch is the "disease" continues to get <em>worse</em> once a person has self-diagnosed themselves with "Morgellons", creating a cycle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">continually worsening condition caused by delusions which are caused by the continuing worsening condition.</a> The only way to prevent it is by avoiding social "contamination" of Morgellons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">which is to say be unaware of the concept in the first place.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis">Hypochondria<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is another example. It's a condition where a person becomes paranoid that their suffering from a chronic or deadly illness, despite nothing being wrong with them. They get many different types of medical test done and told nothing is wrong, but they refuse to accept the positive results. This results in heavy anxiety, panic attacks, and over all bad stress which have symptoms common with some major illnesses which further convinces them something is wrong. And since too much stress is unhealthy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">the person eventually causes a real illness to happen.</a>
</li><li> A very simple vaudeville attraction works this way: You are in a "rotor", and then you get rotated head-over-heels. No, you aren't, it's your surrounding that is rotated, you are completely motionless. But if you fell for it, by now you are probably desperately clenching into your seat for not falling out, creating exactly the force that you'll expect (actio=reactio).
</li><li> Some practitioners of various paths of witchcraft believe in "intent" - if you put a powerful enough intent into a spell, or an object, a sigil, etc., then the event that you wish for will "manifest" (i.e. happen) in real life.
</li><li> Inverted with some mental illnesses and developmental disorders (i.e. depression for the former, autism for the latter). Some people with actual depression and actually autistic people might be afraid of "making it up" or "faking it for attention". While there <em>are</em> people who fake a disorder/an illness for attention <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2klyy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2klyy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2klyy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which, ironically, is usually an indication that they <em>do</em> have mental health issues, just not the ones they're faking</span>, if someone is in doubt about their issues, it's usually best to seek professional advice.
