Sometimes, these morals contradict each other, but nobody is surprised to see any of them in a story. However, sometimes a story aims to teach a lesson well outside the pale of accepted wisdom. For example, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks">Growing Up Sucks</a>, but it's an essential part of life", "you will have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAWhoreToGetYourMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAWhoreToGetYourMan">Be a Whore to Get Your Man</a>", or "Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceReallyIsTheAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceReallyIsTheAnswer">Violence Really Is the Answer</a>".

</p><p>At the same time, though, Aesops that contradict general morality are often controversial (at best) for that very reason. Sometimes, an author <em>thinks</em> they're delivering a hard truth, but the audience doesn't see it that way - or they're split about it. Since one person's hard truth is another's dangerous falsehood, examples belong on this page regardless of whether their Aesops are objectively true, and regardless of how much the audience is convinced that they are. The important thing is that the Aesop is considered "family-unfriendly" in its cultural context.
</p><p>Note that a Hard Truth Aesop doesn't have to be pessimistic. It just has to be surprising and unconventional. Some more optimistic Hard Truth Aesops might be, for instance, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeerPressureMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeerPressureMakesYouEvil">peer pressure</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">is good for you</a> because it convinces you to try new things" (or, conversely, "Rejecting the wisdom of the crowd could end badly,")." Note also that how the Aesop is conveyed may be what makes it a hard truth one: for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex">Good People Have Good Sex</a> almost always gets a far friendlier reception from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNeedToGetLaid">You Need to Get Laid</a>, though both promote sex as a good thing.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A Hard Truth Aesop is not the same as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">Clueless Aesop</a>, which is a moral (usually a common one) presented so ineffectively that the audience either misses the point or doesn't find it at all persuasive. When delivered straight and effectively, the Hard Truth Aesop jolts the audience entirely <em>because</em> the message they figure out is exactly the one the writers wanted them to catch.
</p><p>Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a>, a moral that was once a hard truth may now be seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">Captain Obvious Aesop</a>, especially morals about social mores and civil rights (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">Fair for Its Day</a>). This list is for morals that can be hard to stomach even for the culture for which they were written. A prime target for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">dropping anvils</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beastars">Beastars</a></em> has a couple that are actually stated by characters:
<ul><li> Pacifism is noble, but it only matters coming from someone who's strong enough to defend themselves, as Gosha tells Legosi. Furthermore, there are times where you're going to have to fight if you want to protect yourself or others you care about.
</li><li> Not every evil deed can be explained away with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>. Legosi vainly searches for a reason behind Melon's mass-murdering, only to realize that there is none.
</li><li> No matter how uncomfortable they are, societal and systemic problems need to be brought into the light so they can be properly discussed and solved.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>: When Juno and Asta ask the Wizard King about what they must do to achieve his rank, he gives the answer that nothing is more important than producing results, and he came to be the current Wizard King due to producing more and better results than any other of the captains. While the manga makes clear that effort and kindness are important, this is also a very pragmatic way to see the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em> has an example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">School Play</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">the main characters are putting on in-universe.</a> The play stars a girl who's lost her memory, and gets visits from three people close to her who see her three different ways- her schoolmate sees her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, her brother sees her as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigSister">Aloof Big Sister</a>, and her lover claims she has a vulnerable side that she only shows when they're together. Facing an identity crisis, the main character chooses to act the way her lover saw her as, thus sending a message that it's better to live the way someone else sees you than to be yourself. Because Touko, who plays the girl, has felt pressured to "become" her seemingly perfect sister after the latter's death in a car accident, Yuu convinces Koyomi to change the ending so that the main character's nurse convinces her to just be herself, resulting in the main character telling the other three that she intends to start over. Most of the student council besides Touko likes the new ending better, partly because they believe this outcome makes more sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em> has a few, which is unsurprising given the nature of the show.
<ul><li> Kirie, having learned that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">every time you win, another universe is destroyed</span>, has a talk with Tanaka, believing he cannot fight in light of that information. Tanaka essentially gives him two lessons. 1) People's lives are not equal, and when people are forced into a situation where they must choose one person's life or another's, they will choose the one they value more. 2) People exist because of sacrifice, from the plants and animals they eat every day to continue living, to the ones who died to ensure their standard of life, and even Jesus and the Buddha are no exception.
</li><li> The ending of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chizu</span>'s arc has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> family understandably appalled at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> killing innocent people in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> quest for vengeance against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hatagai.</span> In response, they decide not to press charges against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hatagai,</span> sending the message that it's better to let the guilty escape than cause innocents to suffer through revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaisukiBuBuChaCha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaisukiBuBuChaCha">Daisuki! BuBu ChaCha</a></em>: Prolonged exposure may result in creepiness when your preschooler somehow ends up believing that one of his toys is the reincarnation of or is possessed by the spirit of the recently deceased family pet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Chapter 14, Laios is sure to be wrong about Anne the kelpie. Her friendship with Senshi means she would never attack him even though she's a monster, right? <em>Wrong</em>. She tries to eat him as soon as he gets on her back and the reader learns a brutal lesson about trusting wild creatures: just because they seem tame doesn't mean they can't turn on you in an instant. There's a big difference between "has never attacked" and "safe".
</li><li> Regarding Namari, most stories would penalize her for leaving Team Touden in Chapter 1 because they couldn't pay her fee. Here however she's treated as being in the right and Chilchuck even scolds Marcille for trying to make her return to the party later when she's on another job. She's not shamed for prioritzing her own career and professional reputation over wanting to help old friends, which might damage her job prospects very badly in the future. It teaches the lesson that looking out for yourself is okay sometimes and you shouldn't bend to others if you know what they want is not right for you.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast">Eden of the East</a></em>, Akira (the hero) makes a comment to the effect that Japanese have great potential but need someone to rule them to unlock that potential. In the end, though, it actually subverts this Aesop by more or less stating that while it might achieve great results, it would be wrong to do so. Similarly, Akira/the series seems to take the viewpoint that since national tragedies/catastrophes bring a country together, causing one is a great idea so long as you can figure out a way of doing it without killing anyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> had an episode in which the Digidestined are trapped in an underwater rig that is slowly running out of air, with only one escape pod. Despite knowing that he's afraid of water, the kids coerce Cody into going, creating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAesop">Accidental Aesop</a> of "it's okay to force your friends to have contact with their phobias - it'll help them!" Though, it is possible they just wanted him to go into the pod so he wouldn't have to stay trapped and underwater with them and, thus, be able to avoid his fear. (Note that this is dub-induced. The phobia is nonexistent in the original Japanese version.) Upon reaching the surface, he finds out that to get Joe's help, he would have to lie, something Cody is deeply uncomfortable with, to the point that he later feels that he doesn't deserve the Digi-Egg of Reliability. This leads to the episode's Aesop: <em>that lying is sometimes perfectly okay, if you have a good reason for doing it.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Kiritsigu Emiya</a> always killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">the few to save the many</a> but realizing that even by killing people he deems evil, he'll never create a world free of evil, cruelty, suffering and conflict. So he consults a wish granting device, the Holy Grail, after a long bloody war to get the miracle of world peace. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Holy Grail decides the only way for the world to have peace is for all beings capable of conflict to be dead, so there will be an absence of conflict.</span> Needless to say, Kiritsugu was bothered by the implications that humanity is not capable of everlasting peace. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Grail had been corrupted such that it would twist any wish it could into a wish for worldwide destruction.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">Equivalent Exchange</a> - you get in return what you put into something. Unfortunately, real life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">is far more complex than a simple exchange</a> - the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a> exists for a <em>reason</em>. Dante in the 2003 anime has this to say about it:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Dante</strong>: "Consider the state alchemy exam that you passed with flying colors. How many others took the test that day? Spent months, years preparing, some working much harder than you. Yet you were the only one who passed. Where was their reward? Is it their fault they lacked your natural talent?"
</div></li><li> The famous ghost train episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GeGeGeNoKitaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GeGeGeNoKitaro">GeGeGe no Kitar&#333;</a></em> teaches that sometimes it's too late for second chances. The protagonist of the episode may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">have realized</a> that his cruel behavior drove several of his employees to suicide, but there's nothing he can do to make it up to them&mdash;they're already dead and so is he, and Kitaro refuses to save him as their vengeful spirits drag him off to hell with them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em> (which takes place in the final year of World War II in Japan), all the adults the orphaned protagonist Seita meets tell him he needs to suck up his pride, go apologize to his aunt, and ask her to move back in so he can protect himself and his little sister. He's only fourteen, so he's too youthfully arrogant to really understand that there are more important things than being right and that growing up means that sometimes you have to do things you don't want to in order to survive, especially when you have someone else to take care of.

<ul><li> The moral of the Tsumihoroboshi-hen arc appears to be "friends help friends hide the bodies". But in a more directly stated example, it's okay to hide things from your friends if they don't need to know about it. Even though they're your friends, it doesn't require complete disclosure. While Higurashi certainly emphasizes the importance of trusting your friends, at this point, it acknowledges that there are some things people just can't tell others and shouldn't have to.

</li><li> Jun's backstory's moral is no matter how miserable your life is, and how justified you are in moping about it, you need to stop crying and be happy, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> serves no purpose because your life is too short to waste it whining and there will always be others who have it worse than you.

Modern versions often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerise</a> this, eliminating the original moral.

</li><li> The standard fairy tale plot of a hero overcoming impossible quests to marry a princess gets subverted in Friedrich Schiller's ballad <em>The Diver</em>. A King throws a golden cup into some rough water and declares that whoever can retrieve it can keep it. After the hero manages this, the king ups the ante by throwing a ring into the water and telling the hero that he will get the princess if he can do it again. The hero tries and drowns. The new moral here is "she is probably not worth it" or "quit while you are ahead".
</li><li> Schiller also subverts the "Idiotic challenges will win you the heart of a woman" plot in <em>The Glove</em> in which a lady throws her glove into an arena full of lions and tigers and challenges (mockingly) her suitor to get it. He retrieves the glove, the lady immediately falls for him &mdash; and he throws the glove in her face, saying "Den Dank, Dame, begeher ich nicht" ("Such gratitude, madame, is not desired by me") &mdash; the Aesop is "Women, don't mock your suitor if you want to keep him" or "Men, sometimes a woman is more trouble than she's worth".

Cinderella's prince is a philanderer (probably <em>both</em> of them are, it's just that Cinderella's is the only one who explicitly does it on-, or rather just off-, stage), whereas Rapunzel is somewhat crazy. The only original story Aesop it leaves intact is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood">Little Red Riding Hood</a></em>'s Aesop of "Don't talk to strangers", who became a good deal creepier (as a bonus, traditionally the wolf is played by the same actor who plays Cinderella's prince). Near the end, we get an Aesop of "Listen to people who know what they're talking about, even if they're witches".

</li><li> It's also saying that some people are just plain rotten, and shouldn't be trusted, because of who and what they are.
</li><li> The moral is "Talk does not change the nature of things", i.e., you can discuss something, debate it, argue about it, deconstruct it, reconstruct it, and agree on it. None of that will change its nature.
</li><li> A more down-to-earth moral is that you should not trust wild animals because they can not be reasoned with, and they can and will attack you when you get too close to them.
</li><li> Another way to interpret the lesson is that you can't keep sugarcoating your problems and you can do great harm to yourself by trying to "fix" evil.
</li></ul></li><li> One story involves a cat and a mouse living together and deciding to store a pot of cream for winter. They hide it in a church until they really need it. Over some time however, the cat is gradually tempted three times into drinking the cream, until it's all gone. When the mouse finds out, she starts yelling at the cat for eating their food supply for the winter. The cat responds by eating the mouse, and the story concludes with the lesson that, well, that's just how the world works (that cats and mice just can't co-exist). It also can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">just-so story</a>, i.e. "...and that's <em>why</em> cats and mice are such bitter enemies to this day." From this we can also draw the rather jarring conclusion that some acts are truly unforgivable, such that the conflicts arising from them can never be peaceably settled.
</li><li> One story involves two brothers, one rich and one poor. Subverting the usual setup, the rich brother is quite willing to help out the poor brother, who cannot seem to hold on to money for any length of time. One day the rich brother waits in the bushes by the roadside until he sees his brother, then throws a purse onto the road. The poor brother just keeps walking, and when questioned says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">he was walking with his eyes closed to see how blind people manage.</a> The aesop is that there's just no helping some people.

<ul><li> The first book and the first twenty chapters of the sequel have quite a few, namely: dishonesty is sometimes the best policy, selective truth-telling and manipulation is/can be much more effective than full disclosure, quiet assassinations are a good way to make sure that your enemies don't come back to haunt you rather than risking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a>, the ruthless get ahead where the good do not always, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">torture</a> is effective (but only if you can be sure of when someone's lying), and pragmatism is almost always the better course than following moral convictions. Oh, and the world is a harsh place, so you'd better learn to survive from an early age, as it'll save a lot of pain later. However, the series also makes plain that these lessons aren't a <em>good</em> thing, from a moral standpoint, more a regrettable necessity, and the effect that they have on Harry's moral compass is consistently noted to be somewhat disturbing.

Fletcher responds "That's just something ugly people say". It's pretty much irrefutable that physically attractive people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImBeautiful">usually fare better in society</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FavorsForTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FavorsForTheSexy">are treated more favorably</a> than average-looking or unattractive people, even if their beauty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">is only external</a>. The (in)famous scene with the woman in the elevator also demonstrates this.

Likewise, most couples who get divorced <em>don't</em> get back together. Also, two people who are way too different from one another cannot function together as a romantic couple, especially not in the long run. The original script actually did have them get back together, but with Robin Williams and Sally Field both being divorced, they felt strongly enough to get it changed.

Some examples include:
<ul><li> <em>The Bat and the Weasels</em>: it's sometimes wise to change or lie about your affiliation in order to save your own skin.
</li><li> <em>The Fox and the Goat</em>: don't trust anyone who's in trouble, because they're likely to be using you to get out of it.
</li><li> <em>The Farmer and the Nightingale</em>: never believe a captive's promise and never give up what you have.
</li><li> <em>The Ass and the Lap Dog</em> (and <em>The Eagle and the Crow</em>): just because someone else achieves something good doesn't mean that you can.
</li><li> <em>The Porcupine and the Snakes</em>: be careful who you take as a guest, because they might be an asshole.
</li><li> <em>The Lark and her Young Ones</em>: if something is worth doing, the only one you can trust to do it is yourself.
</li><li> <em>The Wolf and the Lamb</em>: arguing rationally with the powerful is useless, they'll just overwhelm you.
</li><li> <em>The Wolf and the Crane</em>: the higher your hopes, the more likely you are to be disappointed. If you put yourself in danger to help someone, they won't always be grateful and it will be nothing more than a waste of time.
</li><li> <em>The Two Pots</em>: don't hang around powerful people, if there's any mutual trouble you'll get the worst of it.
</li><li> <em>The Man and the Lion</em>: never believe what anyone says in their own defense.
</li><li> <em>The Lion's Share</em> or <em>The Lion and Other Beasts Go Hunting</em>: just because someone wants you to co-operate with them in work does not mean they will give you a share of the reward.
</li><li> <em>The Farmer and the Snake</em>: some people are just plain evil and no amount of building trust will change that.
</li><li> <em>The Ass and his Driver</em>: if someone is determined to destroy themselves, step back and let them, or they'll destroy you too.
</li><li> <em>The Man, the Boy, and the Ass</em>: No matter what you do, someone will dislike it, and trying to change what you do to please everyone will literally make you lose your ass.

</li><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops">Stock Aesops</a> is that cowardice doesn't pay.

At first, the reader may expect that cannibalism is being used as a metaphor, and that we're going to learn an ordinary Aesop about violence being wrong, but in the end, the preacher is forced to learn a valuable lesson: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">cannibalism</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">isn't so bad</a>, really.

The angels send a man named Elwin Ransom to make sure that Tinidril chooses wisely. In the end, good triumphs over evil, but in an unexpected way: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ransom kills Weston and drops his body into a volcano.</span> This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by the protagonist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who assumed that the fight would be purely intellectual, that he would win by the sheer force of his argument, and was initially horrified at the idea that he'd have to make the fight a physical one</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em> has one in-universe: the narrator notes how horrified as a kid he was, because some events of the story just didn't work out as as they did in traditional fairy tales and adventure stories, and found relief only when he realized that the Aesop was "life is not fair".

Yes, it is preferable and best that you look for a non-violent solution to any given problem. But at the same time, sometimes that simply isn't going to work. Insisting on avoiding any violence once it's clear that a compromise can't be reached is dangerous in itself.
</li><li> <em>Squeakers</em>, a leg-crossingly uncomfortable book about a little squirrel with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Squeakers-Serendipity-Stephen-Cosgrove/dp/0843139250">alarmingly fluttery-lashed eyes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, teaches little boys the admittedly important lesson that they have to tell their parents about being molested. The (male) squirrel goes through days on end of hiding the shameful and hideous bald patches on his tail where a neighbor is tearing out fistfuls of his fur on the way home from school every day in exchange for, yes, nuts. Ahem.
</li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> stories:
<ul><li> Probably the best is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSteadfastTinSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSteadfastTinSoldier">The Steadfast Tin Soldier</a></em>, the moral of which is essentially, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeIsntFair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeIsntFair">Life Isn't Fair</a>, and sometimes just when you've worked your hardest to get something right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">something will come out of nowhere and screw it up for no reason</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaloryTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaloryTowers">Third Year At Malory Towers</a></em> has the subplot with Zerelda, a new student who is obsessed with acting and wants to become a famous actress. After getting the chance to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Juliet</a> in class and completely blowing it, the teacher flat-out tells her that she just doesn't have the skill to become one of the greats, and Zerelda learns that when a teacher tells you that your dream will never come true, the best thing to do is give it up for good, instead of improving your skills and continuing to try to achieve your dream.
</li><li> Another classical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">moral</a> is that having imagination is <em>good</em>. So <em>When The Windman Comes</em> by Antonia Michaelis is a huge subversion, with the moral "imagination, when not strictly separated from reality, is potentially very dangerous&mdash;it can isolate you and make you live in fear of imaginary horrors&mdash;all the while making you more vulnerable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Sometimes, being a skeptic is favorable, even for a child." This is particularly jarring since many other books by the same author actually promote imagination and/or openness to seemingly impossible things.
</li><li> The Dr. Seuss book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThidwickTheBigHeartedMoose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThidwickTheBigHeartedMoose">Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose</a></em> completely inverts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesop">Stock Aesop</a> about generosity.

Just make sure both (or all) parties consent and protection is used (and don't catch anything).

<ul><li> "Black Tie White Noise" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> has one, the result of it being written in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles: Racial harmony is possible but don't imagine it's going to be easy to achieve, or that there won't be violence along the way ("There'll be some blood, no doubt about it"). Not a <em>comfortable</em> Aesop, but if history's taught us anything...

He crosses the line and attempts to woo her...and he's eventually caught by the gang, beaten and (presumably) shot in the back of the head by the same girl he was putting his heart on the line for. The video ends in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a> (the girl could have shot the gang leader) but there is a clear message about how not even love is worth crossing a line over.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryChapin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryChapin">Harry Chapin</a>'s song <em>Mr. Tanner</em> is about a man who runs a dry cleaner and loves to sing, and is an amateur performer in his spare time. His friends convince him to try to become a professional singer, so he throws all his money into a concert performance that... bombs. Critics are terse and dismissive with him, suggesting he'd be better off keeping his day job. Mr. Tanner returns to his home and his job and stops performing publicly. The moral here is "Sometimes chasing your dream fails". If you want to be more blunt, you could phrase it "Loving to do something doesn't make you <em>good</em> at it."
</li><li> Indica's song "In Passing" is about a dead singer telling her sister that her pain will go away and everything passes. Not quite unfriendly until the last few lines where she tells her sister that she also will pass. Extremely true and not something most children are equipped with or taught.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers">Kenny Rogers</a> song <em>Coward of the County</em>. The song's message implies that for some things, the only course of action is violence, and being a pacifist will only get the ones you love murdered or hurt. The song also implies that filial piety is futile, and you cannot obey your parents' wishes all the time.
</li><li> O.C. Smith's song "The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp" has a message that being a prostitute doesn't make a woman evil or contemptible.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s "Won't Get Fooled Again" is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss">a trope of this nature</a> which translates to "revolution is futile because the person in charge is always going to make it tough for everyone else".

In addition to their obsession with popularity, Willy and Biff do not realize the amount of effort needed to achieve their dreams. To illustrate, Charlie's son Bernard works hard to become a successful lawyer and Uncle Ben goes into the jungle for four years to find diamonds and come out rich. On the other hand, Willy and Biff are always looking for an easy way out and hate what they do, and that's why they ultimately fail in life.

You may think this is only to show what a shallow and pretentious character Glinda starts out as... Except she's ultimately proven right. Elphaba's actions, no matter how heroic and selfless, all fail to change anything as Madame Morrible launches a smear campaign against her and makes everyone too afraid of her to listen to the problems she's trying to fix. In the end it's Glinda who gets the power to dispose of the villains and change Oz for the better, but does she do it by speaking out against their crimes or trying to help their victims? No, she does it by sucking up to them and endearing herself to the dim-witted people of Oz until she has enough power and influence of her own to launch a non-violent coup d'&eacute;tat.

<ul><li> The game follows the main character as he retraces the steps of the previous tenant of his apartment, which align creepily with his own. Each of the people he meets is facing the dilemma of struggling bravely forward, or giving up, on whatever conflict they're dealing with. Invariably, the answer is to accept one's own limitations. There are some things in life that, no matter how badly you want them and no matter how hard you try, you will never be able to achieve; if you don't fit a certain mold, there's no honor in ruining yourself to force it.

</li><li> The overarching story in Orzammar delivers the message that a progressive-minded individual who is personally a manipulative, sleazy jerk sometimes makes a better leader than a kindly, democratic individual bound by stagnant social traditions.
</li><li> This even applies to Paragon Aeducan, one of the most venerated individuals in Dwarven history. His decision to ignore the Assembly and lead the Warrior Caste in the defense of the city, prevented the Darkspawn from breaching Orzammar and saved their race from being wiped out.

There is a quest called Tenpenny Tower, about a luxurious hotel inhabited by prejudiced humans and a nearby gang of civilized ghouls (a form of monstrously mutated human) who want to live in it. There are three ways to solve this quest &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Two of them involve killing either party and being rewarded by the other for it.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, there are four possible factions that you can join with: Caesar's Legion, the NCR, Mr. House, and Yes Man. While Caesar's Legion is treated as the defacto bad group and are pushed far into the category of evil, the other three have flavors of what one would call "good" about them while retaining some bad. The NCR are the strongest military, but unfortunately are also heavy on taxes and some settlements crumble under their protection as a result. Mr House definitely has the best assets and can help humanity rebuild, but he's in it for entirely selfish reasons and ultimately he will rule New Vegas under his current policy of "money talks" and leave the slums as they are or purge them, and Yes Man's ending has New Vegas purged of all three other factions and declaring independence, but as General Oliver points out: there is absolutely no infrastructure and will likely crumble with no way to retain its independence. As such, there's the hard truth that there is no golden ending, no happy way to resolve all the problems. Like real life, there's not always a perfect answer, it's just about weighing your morals on which answer you choose and accepting that as the reality of your decision.

In summation: you <em>will</em> get old someday, and as you do you'll likely have to give up on your interests and dreams from when you were younger and settle for a boring, mundane career as your priorities change to adult things like getting the bills paid (especially if you have a family) as shown by about half of the old trainers involved. There's a good chance your mind (the Jolteon trainer) and body (the Umbreon and Leafeon trainers) will simply start giving out on you as you age, and even if you manage to stave off aging on the outside with cosmetics, your body will continue to age on the inside (as shown by the Leafeon trainer). And finally, you will <em>die</em> someday (the Sylveon trainer already died and the one you battle instead is her granddaughter). The whole sidequest carries the somber implication that as the times go by and new generations take over, it's most likely that your accomplishments from when you were younger will be forgotten and will end up meaning nothing in the long run.

Regardless of whether Lloyd agrees or not, he ultimately doesn't destroy his Exsphere, and eventually moves on from the revelation to use it in the best way possible. What we use may not always be a good thing , but it can still be used for good, especially if it already exists and thus can be put to good use.

One of these is that almost no one is good enough to get into Heaven, and almost everyone who goes Hell will never get out... not because of anything they do or don't do personally, but because Hell itself can screw them out of their chance at redemption.

</li><li> A recurring aesop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/MisterMetokur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/MisterMetokur">Mister Metokur</a> videos is that sometimes the people who make fun of you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">do legitimately have a point when they mock you</a>, especially if you engage in behaviors that are self-destructive in nature or ones that incur harm in others (such as pedophilia or zoophilia).

He argues that this is one of the most important lessons that anyone can learn, but admits that it's rarely used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> in pop culture because it's so much more uplifting to show a protagonist succeeding through hard work. In the same episode, Critic discusses this trope when naming "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E23HomersEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E23HomersEnemy">Homer's Enemy</a>" one of the 11 best episodes of the show. He sums up the episode's moral as "Sometimes bad things happen to good people for no reason, and sometimes dumb people are rewarded more than smart people", but argues that the episode is brilliant because it faces such a grim message so unapologetically, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">manages to make it surprisingly funny</a>.

Instead, you should strive to "despise people on a personal level." Obviously, it's not necessarily a <em>great</em> moral, but it still rings true to an extent in that one should not mindlessly hate just because they were told to.
