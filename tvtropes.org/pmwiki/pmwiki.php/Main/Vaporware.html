<p>Computer or video game software or hardware with revolutionary or next-generation capabilities that is continuously hyped to the public, but doesn't seem to be coming any closer to store shelves. Note that long development cycles do not, by themselves, qualify a product as Vaporware; the game must be repeatedly postponed and put off, all the while being promoted as "Coming soon!"
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes this is intentional, done by various promoters and stockholders solely to drive up the company's share prices, lure in new investors, or create a buzz in the marketplace that will keep their name on top. In the most extreme cases, the developing company itself may be a total fraud. That said, the vast majority of vaporware isn't malicious. Most of the time there is legitimate product being produced, but internal problems simply result in it falling behind schedule and being passed in the marketplace by competitors. The developers simply promised more than their programmers could possibly deliver in too short a time frame.
</p><p>Often, when a big goal is for the product to be up with the current technology, it becomes a self-reinforcing feedback loop of sorts when work has to be scrapped to keep up with the times. Combine this with people leaving the project out of frustration with the lack of forward progress and it gets harder to finish with every delay. More than a few games have also fallen victim to runaway ego and perfectionism, where the designers get distracted by their own artistic visions or desire to create something revolutionary and genre-shattering and won't be satisfied until it's "perfect", cost, publishers, and release dates be damned! (With predictable results).

<ul><li> <em>32 Extreme</em> was an in-house Sega game for the 32X. It was described as a 32X version of <em>California Games</em> but was cancelled due to add-on's early demise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em>:
<ul><li> In May 1996, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment">Namco</a> announced PC ports of three of their arcade titles, including <em>Air Combat 22</em>. Save for the concurrent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer">Rave Racer</a></em> port making the rounds at some industry trade shows and getting a preview in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/EDGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/EDGE">EDGE</a></em>'s July issue of that year, nothing came of this.
</li><li> Project Aces was working around 2003 on using the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">Ace Combat 04</a></em> engine for a remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xevious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xevious">Xevious</a></em> for that game's 20th anniversary, though little progress was made beyond a tech demo of, basically, putting the Solvalou into <em>Ace Combat 04</em> before the project was quickly shelved in favor of the team working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5</a></em>.
</li><li> A 2007 issue of Famitsu had an article centered on a trio of cancelled games, developed jointly by Project Aces and Cellius (a company owned by both Namco and Sony), which would have been set in the <em>Ace Combat</em> universe: <em><a class="urllink" href="http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Brave_Arms">Brave Arms<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, <em>Second Season 01</em>, and <em>Chain Limit</em>. Little is known about any of them, other than that <em>Brave Arms</em> was to be a 3D beat-em-up set in the Kingdom of Sapin in 2025.

<ul><li> <em>Aliens Interactive</em> was going to be an interactive comic book game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilipsCDi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilipsCDi">CD-i</a> featuring a story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarkHorseComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarkHorseComics">Dark Horse Comics</a>, developed around 1991-1993, with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator">Predator</a></em> followup planned.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienVsPredatorCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienVsPredatorCapcom">Alien vs. Predator</a></em> arcade game was planned to have a 1995 port for the Sega 32X.
</li><li> <em>Alien vs Predator</em> was going to be a 1994 FPS for the Atari Lynx, and was canceled in favor of publishing an <em>Alien vs Predator</em> game on the Jaguar.
</li><li> <em>Aliens Online</em> was a 1998 multiplayer FPS that never left beta when the servers were shut down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">EA</a>.
</li><li> <em>Aliens vs. Predator</em> was going to be a 2004 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> game published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienVsPredator">2004 movie</a>.
</li><li> <em>Aliens: Colonial Marines</em> was going to be a 2002 game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>, unrelated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines">the game released in 2013.</a>
</li><li> <em>Aliens: Crucible</em> was an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em> RPG developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ObsidianEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ObsidianEntertainment">Obsidian Entertainment</a>. The game was cancelled in 2010 when the publisher, Sega, preferred the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines">Aliens: Colonial Marines</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AloneInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AloneInTheDark">Alone in the Dark</a></em>: Capcom was supposed to release AITD 3 for the Japanese market, but decided not to go with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlterEgo">Alter Ego</a></em> was going to have a sequel focusing on child raising that was eventually cancelled.
</li><li> <em>Aftershock</em> was a shooter planned for the 32X. It was cancelled after its studio was closed.
</li><li> <em>Official Dreamcast Magazine</em> did a preview write-up on an intriguing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> game titled <em>Agartha</em> and developed by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick Raynal, the man behind the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AloneInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AloneInTheDark">Alone in the Dark</a></em> series. Unfortunately, Sega Europe pulled the plug on many of their games in development as the Dreamcast's sales faltered so <em>Agartha</em> never saw the light of day, although a short tech demo for the game finally surfaced in January 2018.
</li><li> <em>Agent</em> by Rockstar. Revealed at E3 2006 as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> exclusive title, and has been MIA since. As of New Years 2017, Rockstar has renewed copyright, but it's unclear what state the product is in. In Late August of 2017 there was a supposed leak of new concept art along side the long rumored <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bully">Bully</a></em> sequel having art released, Rockstar and Take 2 have not spoken on if this is real as of February 2020. Take 2 allowed the trademark for Agent to lapse in November 2018.
</li><li> <em>American McGee's Oz</em> was a cancelled spinoff to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanMcGeesAlice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmericanMcGeesAlice">American McGee's Alice</a></em> based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books. McGee later attempted to develop another game based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em>, <em>OZombie</em>, but the game was never released.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing2001">Animal Crossing</a> 2</em> was announced for the GameCube, but no details were given other than the name and a few screenshots, and it ultimately never came out. Based on the screenshots that <em>were</em> released, it's assumed that it was a localization of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japan-only</a> <em>D&#333;butsu no Mori e+</em>, and the international release was halted to focus on the DS's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingWildWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingWildWorld">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a></em> instead.
</li><li> <em>Animal Wars</em> was a game developed by Factor 5, created for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a></em>. It was part of a deal where Factor 5 would develop games for the publisher that started with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lair">Lair</a></em>. The game was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">meets</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, featuring a version of World War I with anthropomorphic animals. Sam, a dog in an aviator suit, would have been the central character, with a stage where the player controls a mouse through a field with enemies large in perspective. Vehicles would have features resembling the animal associated with them. However, Sony decided to cancel Animal Wars to ensure Lair would be finished in time. Because of Lair's disappointing sales and reviews, the deal with Sony was dissolved and Animal Wars was never worked on again.
</li><li> <em>Ant Simulator</em> was an ant simulation game in development that ended up being cancelled. The lead programmer resigned after claiming the game's Kickstarter funds were being mismanaged.
</li><li> <em>Atriarch</em> has been hyped as being a radical MMO since the turn of the millennium, advertising how it will be different from every other game produced before or since. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://atriarch.com/">the website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> seems to receive no updates except to add yet another year to the copyright span (but even that seems to have stopped as of 2012). The character races aren't completely fleshed out, either; the full profile for the Unarra has been "coming soon" since 2003.

</li><li> <em>Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound</em> (A.K.A.

</li><li> Not only was there a plan for a third game in the main <em>Baldur's Gate</em> series of video games, but the console spin-off series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateDarkAlliance">Baldur&#146;s Gate: Dark Alliance</a></em>, was planned to have a third entry in order to create a <em>Dark Alliance</em> trilogy. Unfortunately, with the closure of the publisher, Black Isle Studios, and its parent company, Interplay, the developer Snowblind Studios was forced to halt development on the project sometime around 2004.

The only hints the public got that it wasn't forgotten was a leaked concept trailer in 2009 that made the game look more like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace">IN SPACE!</a>.

The original premise of a sequel will probably never see the light as a video game.
</li><li> <em>Ballerium</em> was an MMORTS developed by Majorem, with beta testing in 2003-2004, to be published by Interplay. The game was cancelled in 2005, relaunched in 2007 by Sleepy Giant, and was defunct by 2008.

It would have been a semi-remake of the first game in the series, but with unexpected twists, such as the mountain in the first level erupting as a volcano. The vehicles were added because the levels ended up being <em>huge</em>, so much that vehicles were necessary to navigate them in any reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately for Rare, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">most fans would have greatly preferred that kind of game and it probably would have sold much better</a>.
</li><li> In 2004, Designer Eric Flannum had discussed the possibility of a potential sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBardsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBardsTale">The Bard's Tale</a></em>, but nothing has come of it since.
</li><li> There were several earlier attempts to develop <em>The Bard's Tale IV</em>. Rebecca Heineman worked on three versions of <em>The Bard's Tale IV</em>, which were not released due to cancellation by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a>.

A 1992 <em>The Bard's Tale IV</em> was going to be released in two parts, but was cancelled. Contraband Entertainment developed a 3D <em>The Bard's Tale IV</em> in 1998, which was cancelled around 2000. A 2003 <em>The Bard's Tale IV</em> project became the fan game <em>Bard&#146;s Legacy: Devil Whiskey</em>. Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/InXileEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/InXileEntertainment">inXile Entertainment</a> released their own version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBardsTaleIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBardsTaleIV">The Bard's Tale IV</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Battlecruiser 3000AD</em> had a number of overambitious ideas that did not materialize.
<ul><li> <em>Battlecruiser Commander</em> was an intended sequel that was planned to have two add-on packs: <em>Battlecruiser 3000AD: Skirmish Pak</em>, which would have had multiplayer, and <em>Battlecruiser 3000AD: Strike Pak</em>, which would feature a first person ship perspective, boarding ships, and player targeted ships.
</li><li> <em>Battlecruiser 3020AD</em> was another eventually-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware">vaporware</a> sequel that would have had a first person ship perspective and persistent online multiplayer.
</li><li> <em>Universal Combat</em> started as the <em>Battlecruiser 3000AD</em> first person ship perspective add-on, <em>Battlecruiser Tactical Engagement</em>, replaced by "Project ABC" or "After Battlecruiser", intended for a 2001 Xbox and PC release, developed in 2001 as <em>Battlecruiser Generations</em> before becoming <em>Universal Combat</em>.
</li><li> <em>Battlecruiser Generations</em>/<em>Universal Combat</em> was intended to have a persistent world MMO version, <em>Battlecruiser Online</em>.
</li><li> <em>Galactic Command</em> was initially a series of action games based on the <em>Universal Combat</em> engine, <em>Universal Combat: Hostile Intent</em>/<em>Hostile Intent: Planetfall</em>, <em>Universal Combat: Hold the Line</em>, and <em>Universal Combat: Edge to Edge</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>B.C.</em> by Peter Molyneux would have been a game about running a cave man settlement. The game was cancelled in 2004.
</li><li> Tales of Game's successfully ran a kickstarter campaign for a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BarkleyShutUpAndJamGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BarkleyShutUpAndJamGaiden">Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden</a></em> back in 2012 and it was supposed to be released in either late 2013 or early 2014. After years of radio silence, in earlier June, 2019 it was stated that the game had been cancelled due to most of the team leaving the project and the whole production going over the scope and collapsing under its own weight.
</li><li> Press releases between 2003 and 2004 indicated that Konami was planning on releasing home versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a></em> <em>7thMIX</em> and <em>THE FINAL</em> as one package for the PS2, but nothing ever came of it.
</li><li> 2-D fighting game <em>Beast's Fury</em> was announced in 2013 by indie developer Evil Dog Productions. It was subject to an <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">contentious production</a> &mdash; the developers actually had <em>no idea</em> how to make a fighting game, severely underestimated the development costs, started multiple crowdfunding campaigns with varying degrees of success, and in general were very mean-spirited to its audience, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism">especially to critics</a>. A demo &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">albeit a poorly-made, buggy one at that</a> &mdash; was released after much delay, and it ended up being the closest Evil Dog ever got to bringing the game to fruition; the project was cancelled in 2016, with bridges burned and tons of livid staff members and customers (many of which out as much as thousands of dollars) targeting Evil Dog's leader, Ryhan Stevens, for his incompetence. It's understandable that the fighting game community now associates the game &mdash;and Stevens &mdash; as perfect examples of the ''don'ts" of game development.
</li><li> <em>Beyond Zero Tolerance</em> was a cancelled Mega Drive and 32X sequel to the Mega Drive game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroTolerance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeroTolerance">Zero Tolerance</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioForceApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioForceApe">Bio Force Ape</a></em>, a fast-moving NES <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">Platform Game</a> by Seta starring a genetically altered chimpanzee using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlerInAllOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlerInAllOfUs">pro-wrestling moves</a>, was previewed in 1991 as an upcoming release, but canceled within a year. Reports in 2005 that a prototype of the game had been discovered turned out to be a hoax, but five years later an actual prototype cartridge of the game was discovered. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/5INj76ni21c">James Rolfe and Mike Matei took a swing at it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioforge">BioForge</a></em> was going to have a sequel, <em>BioForge II</em>. It was eventually cancelled to be reworked as an add-on to the first game, but the add-on was also cancelled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> was no stranger to scrapped ideas and concepts during its ten year run from 2001-2010. This even extended to video games as noted below.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a>: The Legend of Mata Nui</em> was a PC game to be released in September 2001, as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a>'s multi-media promotional push for their then-new toy franchise. It was advertised with screenshots, concept art and the intro video in catalogs, magazines, LEGO instruction booklets and on promo CDs, and LEGO even forbid their writer from concluding the story in the comic series, because they wanted to tell it via the game. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a>: Legend Of Mata Nui</em> would have been a 3rd person exploration/platform game for PC, based on the popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> brand. Players would have had the opportunity to play as each of the six original Toa characters, meet the islanders personally, and fight their way to confront <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Makuta</a> himself. And the entire thing would have been canon, standing as the most complete and most official telling of the 2001 storyline. It never came out, although a number of beta disks are still floating around, and a decade after its cancellation, some gameplay footage was released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> featuring gameplay footage of Onua's level.
<ul><li> The likely reasons for its canning are the bugs (the first level cannot be completed, for one), general gameplay and design issues, and probably the lack of budget and a rushed schedule which the infamous Maori lawsuit<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g0bp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0g0bp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g0bp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> some Maori people were giving LEGO legal trouble for making money off words from their language</span> had a large hand in. Allegedly, the game also had trouble running on most PCs of the time. For years, fans had tried to acquire the beta disks from their owners, even contacting the current right-holder of the game, to no avail for years on end making the game a sort of Holy Grail for the Bionicle fandom.
</li><li> On February 10th, 2018 however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> user Vahkiti (host of channel The Beaverhouse, and co-admin of the BioMedia Project content archival fansite) streamed a leaked copy of an alpha build of the game. It was emailed to the other admin of BioMedia Project JuniorMasterBuilder by an anonymous source, with Vahkiti's co-host of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> Channel speculating on-stream that the source may have been an ex-Lego or Saffire employee. Due to the found version being in it's alpha stages, there are a few differences from the clips leaked previously. The main differences being some textures and the main menu in DeepBrick's video not being present, a debug screen in it's place. Thanks to this, the other levels of the game are now playable. Said leak revealed several flaws that might have caused its cancellation. The motion controls are clunky &mdash; there is no transition between standing still and jutting forward with great speed. The fights are either boring (you can defeat bigger foes without having to near them) or annoying (as it's hard to aim at smaller enemies). The environments, while vast and pretty, barely have any challenges or minigames to offer, as the developers were notoriously inexperienced at making these. At the very end of the first level, there is an impassable glitch. And the story presentation was so cheesy, the Story Team would have de-canonized great chunks of it. These factors and the tight deadline are what probably lead to the game never getting finished. LEGO simply states it wasn't up to their standard of quality, but it's also said that the game could only run on a particular type of graphics card. Thankfully, fans got to play a truly great on-line game for compensation, which was originally intended to be a mere side-note to the PC game.

Before the release of the linked video in late 2012, no one even <em>knew</em> it had been in development. Years later, a document pitch from 2003 was discovered and uploaded to The Biomedia Project giving more details to what the game might have been like essentially being <em>Bionicle</em> meets <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia">Prince of Persia</a></em> gameplay wise.

All that was ever released of the game was a playable demo of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a> quality, not counting the fact that it ends after half a stage.
</li><li> <em>Bracken Tor: Time of Tooth and Claw</em> was first advertised for preorder in 2009. In the years following, release dates were repeatedly given and then pushed back, with the same general explanation every time: the game was very near to completion, but was being delayed to add features or improve content. The game has never officially been cancelled, and as of Summer 2015, the developer's website estimates a Fall 2015 release...
</li><li> <em>Break Shot</em>, a billiards game by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX2">MSX2</a>, was <a class="urllink" href="http://bifi.msxnet.org/msxnet/konami/breakshot/">advertised<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> but never released.
</li><li> <em>The Broken Hourglass</em> was going to be an isometric party-based RPG in a Byzantine-like setting, inspired by <em>Baldur's Gate II</em>. The game was in development from 2005 and was cancelled in 2011.
</li><li> <em>Bully 2</em>, a hypothetical sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bully">Bully</a></em>, has been rumored to be in the works since 2009 by the Composer of the first game. However, very little other than offhand comments have ever been made in regards to the game and nothing at all has been heard since 2013. There however was a suppose leak of concept art of character and environments in 2017, though it hasn't been confirmed if it was real as of February 2020.
</li><li> <em>Cabbage</em> is the codename for an unrelased Nintendo 64DD <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim">Raising Sim</a>. It would link to the Game Boy, where you could carry around your creature like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPet">Virtual Pet</a>. There were also plans for additional disks that featured new toys. The game was ultimately cancelled with the failure of the 64DD, but elements of it were used in <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Pikmin</em>, and <em>Nintendogs</em>.
</li><li> <em>California Raisins: The Grape Escape</em> was developed late in the NES lifespan. That's right, a game based on a marketing ploy to eat more fruit. Despite being finished and reviewed by many magazines, it utterly vanished into the night without being released on the NES. It actually had some cool concepts, like moonwalking... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">which resulted from a game bug</a>. More can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://progressiveboink.com/archive/grapeescape.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/basedoncrap10.htm">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em>Campfire: Become Your Nightmare</em> was a game that was being developed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> by a Swedish company called Daydream Software, who only managed to put out <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/75xsuaNunXk">a live-action trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.unseen64.net/2010/04/15/campfire-ps2-xbox-cancelled/">a press release<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> before going into liquidation in 2003. It was to have been a "reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a>" game where you play as one of four masked killers stalking and murdering teens at a campground with a variety of weapons, similar to the later games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Manhunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Manhunt">Manhunt</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaughtyBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaughtyBear">Naughty Bear</a></em> only with more explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> influences.
</li><li> <em>Capcom Fighting All-Stars</em> was going to be a 3D fighting game featuring several classic Capcom characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Ryu, Charlie, Chun-Li,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools">Batsu, Akira,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strider">Strider Hiryu,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Poison, and Mike Haggar</a>, and original characters such as Ingrid, Rook and D.D. The game wasn't received well with beta testers, and was cancelled and turned into the less-than-stellar <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomFightingEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomFightingEvolution">Capcom Fighting Evolution</a></em>.
<ul><li> The original 1987 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StreetFighterI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StreetFighterI">Street Fighter</a></em> was the only 2D <em>Street Fighter</em> game not to be represented in <em>Evolution</em>, but originally, that was not going to be the case. Sagat (who would've lacked his chest scar), Eagle (who would've used his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2</a></em> sprite) and Retsu (in what would have been his first appearance since 1987) were all planned for the game, but had to be omitted because of time constraints.
</li><li> <em>All-Stars</em> was initially intended to recycle 3D assets that had been created for <em>another</em> cancelled Capcom fighting game, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2018/may/09/capcom-vs-snk-3-might-have-actually-been-development-some-point/">which was heavily implied<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom">Capcom vs. SNK 3</a></em>. Director Toyohisa Tanabe hinted that because of this, Kyo Kusanagi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> was even planned to appear as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter">Guest Fighter</a> in <em>All-Stars</em> at one point.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Cartoon Network: Backlot Party</em>, featuring characters from several of the channel's shows, was planned for a 2015 release, but no further information was given. See <a class="urllink" href="http://lostmediawiki.com/Cartoon_Network:_Backlot_Party_(Cancelled_Video_Game;_2015)">the Lost Media entry here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaResurrection">Castlevania: Resurrection</a></em> was announced as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a> launch title, featuring Sonia Belmont. Late in development, it was cancelled for reasons that remain mysterious.
</li><li> A <em>Castlevania</em> title, <em>Castlevania: The Bloodletting</em>, in development for the Sega 32X got canned when the system was discontinued; some of its spritework was recycled for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</a></em>. The game's fan nickname is <em>Castlevania: The Bloodletting</em>.
</li><li> Among the many Game.com titles that got the axe was a port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>; while there's not much information available, it seems that it didn't get far in development.
</li><li> A <em>Castlevania</em> game was announced for the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2008, with a short video of Alucard as the main character, in 3D. It's likely Konami canceled the game to focus on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Developer "Dejawolfs" was working on a fan remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">Castlevania</a></em> in Unreal Engine. Development stopped due to a cease and desist, though the developer is attempting to acquire a license from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> was going to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">Licensed Game</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> called <em>CatDog: Saving Mean Bob</em>, but the game was never released.
</li><li> <em>Catharsistage!</em> was announced in 2018 by DMM Games, and was to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolGenre">idol</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim">Raising Sim</a> where the player took on the role of both manager and therapist for an agency's boy bands. In 2019, the official website closed with a message on the developers' Twitter saying that they would temporarily stop updating both the website and the Twitter in order to focus on making a more high-quality game, but nothing has come of it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> PSP port by Variant Interactive was just wishful thinking, as the company soon folded and never got Studio Pixel's official permission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CelDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CelDamage">Cel Damage</a></em> was going to have a sequel. The sequel would offer new character designs (such as Violet and Dominique having new hairstyles and more cleavage, Sinder being made <em>cute</em>, and Fowl Mouth becoming colorized), on-foot combat in addition to vehicle combat, many of the changes and improvements from <em>Cel Damage Overdrive</em>, and new level themes, such as islands and underwater levels. Sadly, EA pulled the plug on the game before it could even progress past the early prototype stage, just so they could make room for more sports games and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movie tie-ins. Years after its cancellation, former Psuedo Interactive employees posted the concept art and a 15-second montage of clips from the early prototype to the Internet.
</li><li> The computer game adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em>, the pencil-and-paper superhero RPG, provides an epic example of this trope. Cover-featured in <a class="urllink" href="http://vu.morrissey-solo.com/moz/perez/info/cgw4-92.htm">a 1992 issue of ''Computer Gaming World''<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it promised to be an ambitious and groundbreaking game that would be faithful to both the RPG and the superhero genre. It never happened. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/pcgraveyard_champions/index.html">According to Steve Peterson<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, designer of the original <em>Champions</em>, the game was about 50% complete when it was canceled. Problems included the game's extremely ambitious design for its day along with the divorce of the game's chief developers, a husband-and-wife team. <em>Champions</em> would finally become a computer game in 2009 as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>, but apart from the underlying intellectual property, it has no relation to the vaporware classic. Also, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em> port for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox360</a> was eventually cancelled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChaosCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChaosCode">Chaos Code</a>: Next Episode of Xtreme Tempest</em> was announced at EVO Japan in January 2020, only to be canned not even a month later when publisher FK Digital announced the game had been cancelled and that they would end development of new titles by the end of March 2020. Series producer Mickey Lin revealed after the announcement that the game had been in development for years with his brother as lead developer, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">he passed away of illness</a> in 2017. Lin attempted to keep up development, but it ultimately proved to be too big of an undertaking both for him and for FKD as a whole.
</li><li> <em>Chaos Chronicles</em>, by Coreplay, was going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">D&amp;D 3.5E</a> isometric, party-based, tactical turn-based RPG on a hex grid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52">Cheetahmen</a> 2</em> was envisioned to be part of a long running game franchise to rival <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>. The game was not released, aside from the discovery of some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">very unfinished</a> prototype cartridges.
</li><li> <em>Chocobo Racing 3D</em> was announced for the 3DS, and was cancelled in 2013.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> fan project <em>Chrono Trigger: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrimsonEchoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrimsonEchoes">Crimson Echoes</a></em> was cancelled, with 35 hours of gameplay and eleven endings. A 3D remake of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, initially developed on the N64 as <em>CT64</em>, ended up being on Windows as <em>Chrono Resurrection</em>, with ports planned for Xbox and GameCube. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Both fan projects ended up being abandoned due to a cease and desist</a>.

The N64 Clayfighters themselves were a reworking of a canceled <em>Clayfighter 3</em> for the SNES and M2 console. An installment for the Nintendo DS and Wii, titled <em>Clayfighter: Call of Putty</em>, was planned as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em>63 1/3</em>.
<ul><li> An untitled ClayFighter 2016 game would have been a megamix of all three games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MortalKombatTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MortalKombatTrilogy">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a></em>, with characters and stages done in higher resolution, characters with new moves based on unused sprites from past games, and the return of HoboCop as a playable character.

Not much is known about what was intended, but it would have led into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Red Alert 2</a></em> due to another time travel act and conclude the Tiberian series. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Red Alert 3</a></em> would have been the bridge between the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Red Alert</a></em> and <em>Tiberian Dawn</em>, showing how the Brotherhood of Nod would have risen from the ashes of the Soviet Union. This would later all be nixed by EA, possibly because of the confusing plot lines involving time travel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em> was going to be followed by <em>Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade 2</em>.

It never happened &mdash; their publisher at the time, Apogee, offered more guaranteed money for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D">a game featuring John Carmack's new 3-D engine</a> rather than a sidescroller. What makes this vaporware instead of a mere tease is that it's never really been officially abandoned, and a couple of the creators still insist they'd like to make the sequel.
<ul><li> After years of the franchise being dormant, a sequel was announced on June 9, 2019. Commander Keen was now an adult; the story would focus on Keen's children, Billy and Billie, as they attempted to rescue him. It was to be a free-to-play mobile game, and the gameplay itself was radically different from all the games before it. The reaction was, to say the least, <a class="urllink" href="https://screenrant.com/commander-keen-mobile-game-disappointment/">disastrous<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with a multitude of fans (and even one of Keen's creators) decrying it. No further news was released afterwards, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/73768/bethesda-cancels-commander-keen-mobile/">all traces of the game were scrubbed from the internet<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in June 2020.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em> was originally designed to be a cute, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em> type platformer named "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEuFNl4s9yI">Conker's Quest<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", just like <em>Conker's Pocket Tales</em> for Game Boy Color. They then revamped the game, and changed it to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuIKBgZMcw&amp;feature=related">"Twelve Tales: Conker 64"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, in which it was more of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon">Spyro the Dragon</a></em>-type platformer. In the end, Rare got aggravated about the complaints of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwelveTalesConker64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwelveTalesConker64">Twelve Tales: Conker 64</a></em> looking childish and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks">too similar</a> to <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and ended up changing the story completely, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Timeskip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Timeskip">timeskipping</a> Conker from a child to an alcoholic adult and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvoidTheDreadedGRating">avoiding the E rating altogether</a>. Thus, making the <em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em> we know today.
<ul><li> In the sequel, <em>Conker's Other Bad Day</em> or <em>Conker: Gettin' Medieval</em>, it was planned that Conker did so horribly as king (he squandered the treasury's worth of moolah for parties, beer and hookers to a point of bankruptcy) that he was thrown in the dungeon and had to escape, ball and chain in tow, back to his throne. The sequel was cancelled by Microsoft in favor of <em>Kinect Sports</em>. Also, another draft of the sequel was going to have Conker killed as early as the first scene in friendly fire.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Contact">Contact</a></em> was Carl Sagan's idea for a non-violent video game that would teach astronomy by starting on the Earth and finding a location in the Milky Way galaxy, or finding the Earth from another point in the galaxy. It was envisioned either as one game with two modes, or two separate games, <em>Contact 1</em> and <em>Contact 2</em>.
</li><li> <em>Coolsville</em> was being developed by Music Pen for the fall of 1994 release, but it was later cancelled after the publisher closed down. It was going to be a jazz-themed PC adventure game aimed at a children audience.
</li><li> A Wii game based on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConnieTalbot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConnieTalbot">Connie Talbot</a>'s <em>Over The Rainbow</em> album was scheduled to be released on the first quarter of 2009, but no further information was given apart from an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/connie-talbot--over-the-rainbow-sing-a-long-connie-promoting-her-wii-game-at-e3">announcement<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from the then-young Talbot to appear in E3 2019 and promote the game. And guess who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjabreadMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjabreadMan">developed</a> it...
<ul><li> If there's any consolation, what appears to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo">Full Motion Video</a> snippets of the game <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9ACU0fm3S8">did surface<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on a fan-run channel, a few years after the game was supposed to be released and shortly before Data Design Interactive went bankrupt. Though given how DDI has been viewed as a third-rate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware">Shovelware</a> house of dubious merit, it wasn't such a bad idea after all for the game to be quietly canned, perhaps much to Connie's benefit who was initially being criticised for being an infantile novelty act with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButCacophonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteButCacophonic">no nuance or depth</a>" by the time the game was announced.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Converse City Ball</em> was a cancelled street basketball game for the Sega 32X. It was promoted as having over 15k frames of hand-drawn animation.
</li><li> <em>Corridor 7: Alien Invasion</em> was successful enough for the developers to immediately begin work on a sequel titled <em>Corridor 8: Galactic Wars</em>. This got as far as a prototype (really a working mockup), running on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine">Build engine</a> and using assets from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, but Capstone's bankruptcy killed the game.
</li><li> A handful of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> games were either never released or became something else:
<ul><li> There was a game developed by Tom Ruegger, best known as the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em>, but it was ultimately canceled.

Some game elements were worked into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Crash Bandicoot: Evolution</em> was going to be a game on the GameCube, featuring the character Foofie, a planet known as Gaudi, a floating city, and a fish world.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTwinsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTwinsanity">Crash Twinsanity</a></em> was going to have a sequel, <em>Crash Twinsanity 2</em>, taking place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand">Trapped in TV Land</a> setting with over 25 levels.

</li><li> <em>Crash Clash Racing</em> was going to be a racing game on the GameCube, PS2 and Xbox. The game was reworked into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTagTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTagTeamRacing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTagTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTagTeamRacing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a></em> was going to have a port on the Nintendo DS in 2005.
</li><li> <em>Bandicoot Brats</em> was going to be a <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KromeStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KromeStudios">Krome Studios</a>, but was cancelled to focus on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro">The Legend of Spyro</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Crash Online</em> was mentioned on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a> website from 2006-2007. No details are known, but it may have ended up as the interactive <em>Crash Village</em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a> website.
</li><li> <em>Crash Landed</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RadicalEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RadicalEntertainment">Radical Entertainment</a>, was going to be a <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> reboot on Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360, developed around 2010-2013 before development shifted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">the ill-fated</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2">[PROTOTYPE 2]</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Crash Team Racing</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HighImpactGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HighImpactGames">High Impact Games</a>, was going to be a racing game and spinoff to <em>Crash Landed</em>, being developed around 2010.

</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> game was being developed by Cerny Games. After being cancelled, elements of the game were reworked into the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Knack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Knack">Knack</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Crimsonland 2</em> is certainly taking its sweet time to appear.
</li><li> <em>The Crossing</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArkaneStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArkaneStudios">Arkane Studios</a>, was going to be a hybrid single-player and multiplayer FPS, set in parallel timelines of Paris, and was cancelled in 2012.
</li><li> <em>Cry On</em>, a collaboration between studios <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mistwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mistwalker">Mistwalker</a> and Cavia, was announced in 2005, but abruptly cancelled in 2008 due to "poor economic conditions", much to the dismay of journalists. A concept trailer for the game was later released in <em>2014</em>, four years after Cavia went under.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CulpaInnata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CulpaInnata">Culpa Innata</a></em> has a sequel, but it has not been released because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">the developers were owed money by the publishers</a> and the game finished on such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a>. The rest of the story was eventually published as a book with the same name, however, this probably means the sequel won't be released as a game anymore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> was going to have a multiplayer add-on for <em>Crusader: No Regret</em>, titled <em>Crusader: No Survivors</em>. The third game would have been titled <em>Crusader II</em>, <em>Crusader: No Mercy</em>, or <em>Crusader 3: No Escape</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cytus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cytus">Cytus</a></em> was going to get an arcade version named <em>Cytus Omega</em>, which was announced in 2015. However, it was cancelled in 2018 due to the expiration of the contract between Capcom and Rayark, with Rayark feeling that the game was still not at the level that they wanted it to be at.
</li><li> <em>Dai Koukai Frontier</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a>, initially <em>Minna to Dai Koukai Frontier</em> as part of the <em>Minna to</em> series, was going to be a pirate themed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobilePhoneGame">Mobile Phone Game</a> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGAme/MarvelVsCapcom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGAme/MarvelVsCapcom2">Ruby Heart</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana">Daikatana</a></em> was going to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> port. A <em>Daikatana</em> sequel was being developed by Human Head Studios on the Unreal Engine; when the project was cancelled, the developers began working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune">Rune</a></em>.
</li><li> In 1995, a first-person sandbox PC game called <em>Damocles</em> was supposed to come out. Its goal would have been to explore a solar system in order to save a planet from a collision with a comet. The solar system would have been <em>completely</em> explorable; the players would have had the freedom to fly in space, land and move freely on any planet, enter any building, explore any room, pick up any object, blow up any building and even destroy any planet they wanted. Psygnosis canceled the game when it was practically complete.
</li><li> <em>Dance TraX</em> was a dancing game in the vein of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PumpItUp">Pump It Up</a></em> (though with a differently-designed pad than those two) which was slated to hit arcades in 2006 or '07. However, everything about the game went silent after the company that made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InTheGroove">In the Groove</a></em> got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Screwed by the Lawyers</a>; the developers likely believed <em>Dance TraX</em> would have met the same fate. Some of the songs made their way to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StepMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StepMania">StepMania</a></em>, but nobody knows if they're based on official data from the game or not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> was going to be a 2003-2004 game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a>, featuring a series of fight scene vignettes emulating the comic stories. It was reworked as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> game to take advantage of Daredevil's radar abilities. It was reworked again as a level based game where the radar abilities became more useless in the narrower environments, and the game was cancelled. There were also plans for an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elektra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elektra">Elektra</a></em> game as a followup. The game would have had the Man Without Fear battle a number of familiar foes such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a>, Silvermane, Hammerhead and the Rose, have appearances by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elektra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Elektra">Elektra</a> and Echo and have unlockable costumes such as his original red and yellow suit. Daredevil would have traversed through Hell's Kitchen either by swinging on his billyclub or by grinding (something Sony requested and Marvel was very wary of adding because Daredevil doesn't grind). There was also a precursor of the Detective Mode from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> based on Daredevil's Radar Sense. The game would have been based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a>'s <em>Elektra Lives Again</em> and had Daredevil trying to stop a crime war when it seems the Kingpin was murdered. However, the game was shelved when Marvel, very unhappy with the fact that the studio making it, 5000 Ft., opted to side with Sony a little too much, refused to let it be approved. This wasn't counting the fact that there was an internal war between the old members of the team and new ones hired.
</li><li> The on-rails <em>Darksider</em> was a 32X game that was cancelled for being too similar to another game by the studio.
</li><li> <em>Dark Zion</em> was going to be an MMORPG, by Wombat Games, with the lead programmers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline">Ultima Online</a></em>, and a story by author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams">Tad Williams</a>. The game would have had a player controlled world with player run businesses, ecology, towns, and armies. Permadeath was planned as a possible feature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dawngate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dawngate">Dawngate</a></em> was a cancelled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena">MOBA</a> by Waystone Games.
</li><li> <em>Dead Phoenix</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailShooter">Rail Shooter</a>, starring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoid</a> named Phoenix, was one of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> Five" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1pz6k');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1pz6k" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1pz6k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe">Viewtiful Joe</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">killer7</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03">P.N.03</a></em></span> set of games announced for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, and the only one that wound up being canceled.
</li><li> <em>Dead Rush</em> was an open-world action horror game for the PS2, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> announced in 2004 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a>. It was to be developed by Treyarch<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2nejv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2nejv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2nejv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">nowadays best known as the company that releases <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">on even</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">numbered years</a></span>, and given a release date of 2005. The game was essentially described as "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">with zombies!</a>"; it was to even use <em>GTA</em>'s style of "one big initial load screen and then no more after that" to make load times on all versions as minimal as possible, something that would have been impressive for a multi-console release of the time. The main character, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacHero">Amnesiac Hero</a> named Jake, had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> in which he could take on missions to help survivors during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, and uncover the truth behind the zombie outbreak. One feature about the game that would have been unique for its time was that Jake could collect parts from broken cars and make new ones with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a>, and the custom cars could have things like better armor and other attachments to make sure the cars could survive plowing through zombies (all cars would have had their own life bars of sorts). <br><br>Given Treyarch had experience with open world games thanks to developing the excellent <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> games, hopes were high for it. The game was shown off at E3 2004 behind closed doors, but <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/OAA1dtZuk8Y">a trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and many screenshots do exist (and if you were a <em>Game Informer</em> subscriber in 2004, then chances are good you have the issue of the magazine that did an expansive preview of the game). Sadly, <em>Dead Rush</em> was cancelled just a few months after it was shown off at E3, with Activision stating that the game "wasn't meeting expectations". Note that this was before Activision turned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> into their main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchises</a>, so even before Activision became reliant on their "big name" IPs they were still catching flak from gamers for cancelling promising-looking projects.

Later on that year, it was announced that the game would be a free-to-play title. Apart from that, <em>Deep Down</em> has been conspicuously absent from trade shows and electronics expos that Capcom has been present at, and as of 2018 it still doesn't have a release date.

The game was to take place between <em>Dirty Harry</em> and <em>Magnum Force</em>, and was to be included in a five disc movie box set along with all the films. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in continuing the film's story over several video games. TimeGate Studios was to rebuild the game in a new engine, with help from Monolith Productions, but the game was cancelled in 2008. Sensory Sweep Studios were developing more <em>Dirty Harry</em> games for PSP, DS, and Xbox, along with a different PS2 game with a Wii port, and a PC port of the PS3/Xbox 360 game, none of which were released.

The project was canned once Rareware left Nintendo for Microsoft.
<ul><li> The game wasn't immediately canned after that; Rare still had the source code, and they attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">retool it into a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SabreWulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SabreWulf">Sabre Wulf</a></em> game called <em>Sabreman Stampede</em>.

The game went unreleased, and ended up being replaced by a more properly <em>Doom</em>- like game that came out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Doom2016">in 2016</a>.
</li><li> <em>Dragon Empires</em> was going to be a fantasy MMORPG by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Codemasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Codemasters">Codemasters</a>. Developed in 2001, with a release planned for 2002, then pushed to 2003, the game was cancelled in 2004.
</li><li> <em>Dragon's Heaven</em>, developed by Face, was a 2D fighter for Neo Geo that ended up not being released.

Also, it's apparently not even going to be the proper conclusion to the series, which is going to have to wait for <em>The Longest Journey Home</em>... expected to be released some time around <em><strong>2030</strong></em>&mdash;<a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/ragso/status/741008032528801794">if at all<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em>Duality</em> was to be a first-person shooter developed by Double Aught (who worked with Bungie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarathonInfinityBloodTidesOfLhowon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarathonInfinityBloodTidesOfLhowon">Marathon Infinity</a></em>); the main character is rescued from the labs of the Deciding Factor, a theocracy of sorts that's conducting inhumane genetic experiments, and must seek out the last remnant of the "ancient builders" and the evil force that destroyed them and was locked away in the planet's core (shades of the Jjaro and the W'rkncacnter from <em>Marathon</em>). It was meant to come out sometime in 1998, but ultimately never did.
</li><li> Possibly the strangest example of vaporware ever: a light gun game called <em>Duelin' Firemen</em>. Set to be released for the 3DO in early 1996, this was an FMV game about... singing firemen! Yes, you read that just right. Singing firemen. Instead of, you know, putting out fires and saving innocent victims, the object of the game was to find buildings that were <em>not</em> burning and perform a dance routine of the captain's choice. The light gun would be used when a rival brigade appeared, who you would need to eliminate with your trusty fire hose. To win the game, you had to score a contract with a Japanese record company. Yes, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/Msp2xO_TdQ4">this was actually for real!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>'s interface ('It's not coming in your lifetime, but it's coming.') will supposedly get a revamp when it gets closer to the fabled v1.0. Understandable, since it's an alpha product. Tarn Adams jokingly estimated in one interview that at his current rate of progress 1.0 will come out sometime in the <em>early 2020s</em>. Which isn't to say that it's not being worked on. The Toady One releases progress reports on a fairly regular basis, but given the type of game that Dwarf Fortress is, it will be a very, <em>very</em> long time before it's near completion. Considering that as of 2018 it was still only version 0.44.12, early 2020s may have been optimistic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem">Duke Nukem</a></em>:

</li><li> <em>Duke Nukem: Endangered Species</em> was a cancelled hunting game using a modified <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Carnivores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Carnivores">Carnivores</a></em> engine. Some assets were used in <em>Vivisector: Beast Within</em>.

Legal issues between 3D Realms and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GearboxSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GearboxSoftware">Gearbox Software</a> over the Duke Nukem license caused the game to be refitted into an original title, <em>Bombshell</em>.

In late 2012, they announced it had not been cancelled, and gave a projected release date of summer 2013. Nothing has been heard since.
</li><li> <em>Dungeon Keeper 3: War for the Overworld</em>, cancelled in 2000, would have featured an improved economy, a new playable race, new playable heroes, and multiplayer.
</li><li> In the mid-2000s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> was looking to create a spinoff franchise based around the dwarfs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em> (simply titled "Dwarfs'') taking a darker fantasy-epic tone (with a goal of drafting out thousands of years of Dwarf history). As a companion to a movie about how the dwarfs met and the origins of the Evil Queen and Magic Mirror, Disney hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ObsidianEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ObsidianEntertainment">Obsidian Entertainment</a> to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> distant prequel set generations beforehand focusing around a young prince traveling with the ancestors of the Seven Dwarfs. Said game opened with the prince fighting a monster only to be revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was put under some hallucination spell and that he actually killed his mother the queen, setting into motion a journey to redeem himself</span>.
</li><li> <em>Eight Days</em> by SCE London Studio was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> action game that was indefinitely put on hold in 2009.
</li><li> <em>Eight Tentacles of the Apocalypse</em> by Absurdus was announced as the third game in the "Kraken trilogy" after their two other games <em>Eye of the Kraken</em> (2002) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CarteBlanche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CarteBlanche">Carte Blanche</a></em> (2006). The game would have tied the two others together to create a grand finale; <em>Carte Blanche</em> features a character export feature that presumably would have been used in <em>Eight Tentacles</em>. It had a tentative 2010 release date, but Absurdus got as a far as a trailer before the project went dormant.

Had they not been outbid by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda</a>, <em>Fallout 3</em> would have been made by none other than Black Isle alumni developers Troika Games, creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade &#150; Bloodlines</a></em>. Several ideas from Van Buren would eventually be implemented in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, though with changes to reflect the later time period. One of the most notable is Joshua Graham, the Burned Man - in <em>Van Buren</em> he was to be the "Hanged Man" instead, the first and statistically strongest companion available to the player, but also an extremely angry individual who was likely to piss off anyone and everyone else you came across. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?forums/van-buren-a-fallout-adventure.86/">A group of fans hope to recreate Van Buren as it was originally envisioned.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

However, thanks to poor sales, <em>Brotherhood of Steel 2</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">didn't get made either</a>. Interestingly, when the design documentation was made public in 2009, it revealed it would have used concepts from both <em>Van Buren</em> and the cancelled <em>Tactics</em> sequel.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Tactics_2">Fallout Tactics 2<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> would have taken place in Florida and the Southeastern USA, and concerned an irradiated, faulty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fallout2">GECK</a> creating powerful, man-eating mutant plantlife that threatened to overwhelm the barren (but inhabitable) deserts.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a> would have been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">moral ambiguity</a> of "man versus nature."
<div class="indent"><strong>Gareth Davies</strong>: My favorite aspect of the theme was the idea that you essentially have nature doing its thing and rapidly rejuvenating the desert wastes, but those wacky humans feel the need to oppose it because they don't like the idea of becoming fertilizer.

</li><li> Obsidian designer Chris Avellone described a possible <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> game set in the former Los Angeles area, the Boneyard, as either <em>Fallout: New Vegas 2</em>, or <em>Fallout: Los Angeles</em>, as a followup to <em>New Vegas</em>. However, Bethesda declined to continue working with Obsidian Entertainment in favor of in-house development.
</li><li> Prior to the iOS/Android <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutShelter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutShelter">Fallout Shelter</a></em>, John Carmack proposed a <em>Fallout</em> game for the iPhone.
</li><li> A <em>Fallout</em> top-down shooter was being developed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/InterplayEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/InterplayEntertainment">Interplay</a>, along with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> A game based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">The Fast and the Furious</a></em> was announced for the Playstation 2 in 2003. It was to be developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Genki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Genki">Genki</a> (the developer behind the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoXtremeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TokyoXtremeRacer">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a></em> series) and published by Vivendi Universal. The game faded from public consciousness and was later cancelled without anyone noticing. In 2006, a different game based on the film series was released for PS2, but it was completely different from the earlier one. (This one was developed by Eutechnyx and published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamcoEntertainment">Namco</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FearEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FearEffect">Fear Effect Inferno</a></em> by Kronos Digital Entertainment, was going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> sequel based on the first game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">best ending</a>.
</li><li> <em>Fear and Respect</em> was a wide-open sandbox game set up as a vehicle for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg">Snoop Dogg</a> and was produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSingleton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSingleton">John Singleton</a> that was set to be ready for a 2006 release. But despite having much buzz (such as a cover story in Game Informer and the announcement of a film version that would also feature Snoop Dogg), Midway canceled the game due to a crowded market.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fez">Fez</a></em> was well received when it was released in 2012, so a sequel was a definite...or so we thought. Naturally, a sequel was announced in 2013. A month later, head developer Phil Fish got into an argument on Twitter over Microsoft's policies on self-publishing. After the argument got especially heated, Fish announced that <em>Fez 2</em> was cancelled and he was retiring from the video game industry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> was announced for the <em>WonderSwan Color</em> as one of the original three games that would have both a port and a special edition <em>WonderSwan Color</em>. It didn't happen.
</li><li> After its cancellation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> expressed interest in further exploring the universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> as an MMORPG, and there was even evidence that it was in the works; Penny Arcade even remarked on it ("Everyone just rolls shaman"). There's been little word on the game since 2006, and while developer Dark-Cryo has picked up the pieces of what was developed, they seem to be doing so without authorization from 20th Century Fox or Mutant Enemy.
</li><li> <em>Fireteam Rogue</em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionAdventure">Action-Adventure</a> game developed in the mid-1990s for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. Publisher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Accolade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Accolade">Accolade</a> intended it to be the launch of a major franchise, including a toyline and a TV series. For all its ambitions (Accolade promised over 100 hours of gameplay), and despite being previewed in several magazines, the game was never finished.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/01/12/late-night-fun-the-flash-video-game-that-might-have-been/">There were plans<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> game made by BottleRocket and Brash Entertainment. The game was, sadly, cancelled in 2008 when Brash went belly up. With a story written by Marv Wolfman, it would have starred the Barry Allen Flash and had him deal with his famed Rogue's Gallery. In-game footage from the alpha had <em>very</em> obvious nods to Sonic (beyond the running part, there were dash pads and grinding) and the Spider-Man games. It was also highly possible to play as other speedsters from the Flash Family.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLE51D8DC24EBCBFA5&amp;v=-fGs1QcUWsg">According to this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the game initially started out with the idea of having the Flash help out other legendary DC city locations, like Metropolis and Gotham City, but curtailed it back to just Central and Keystone City. Instead, it would focus on the Wally West Flash during the first twelve months of his superheroic carrer, justifying the need for tutorials and such as Wally would be getting the hang of being the Flash. The Flash would deal with his Rogues Gallery before facing down the ultimate villains of the game, Gorilla Grodd and Professor Zoom. There would also be an online multiplayer mode that would allow players to race against other speedsters with the possibility of even bringing in Superman.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomFighters">Freedom Fighters</a></em> had a sequel announced half a year after its release in 2003. Very little has been heard of it since.
</li><li> Back in the early days of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">Gaia Online</a></em>, before Houses and Towns, there was an announcement sent out about an MMO they were going to develop, referred to as the Battle System. While details were slim, there were several times during the development where it was announced as an upcoming feature users should be on the watch for. By the time Pinball materialized, a few months before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG!</a></em> finally entered closed beta testing, "When the Battle System is finished" had already become a running gag among the userbase.
</li><li> <em>Gekido</em> was a side-scrolling beat-'em-up released for the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> in 1999, that received a sequel for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> titled <em>Gekido Advance: Kintaro's Revenge</em>. A second sequel titled <em>Gekido: The Dark Angel</em> was supposed to come out for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a> around 2006 but nothing outside of <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110128105143/http://www.gekidothegame.com/">a teaser<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was ever shown.
</li><li> <em>George A. Romero's City of the Dead</em>. It showed up at E3 2005 with no playable demo, and was soon canned.
</li><li> <em>Gods &amp; Heroes: Rome Rising</em> was going to be an MMO by Perpetual Entertainment, and was cancelled to focus on <em>Star Trek Online</em>, with the game rights bought by Heatwave Interactive.
</li><li> <em>Gotham By Gaslight</em> by Fracture 1 was going to be a video game adaptation of the very first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworlds">Elseworlds</a> story of the same name, where a Victorian era Batman battled Jack The Ripper. The game was cancelled in 2010.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a></em> series almost had an entry on the PS2 called <em>Gran Turismo For Boys</em>, an entry directed at younger gamers. (Never mind that the games regularly garner "E for Everybody" ratings from the ESRB.) It was scheduled for release in 2005, around the same time as <em>Gran Turismo 4</em>, but never appeared. When discussing plans for <em>Gran Turismo 5</em>, Kazunori Yamauchi said he was hoping to make <em>GT For Boys</em> a feature within that game. That didn't happen either.
</li><li> A video game based off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em>, not the NES game, was pitched at one point. It recreates the town havoc scene in the first movie, and you play Gizmo as you set up traps to stop the other Gremlins. It was turned down, but the guy who pitched it <a class="urllink" href="http://neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=36011147&amp;postcount=91">put some previews of what it could've been like<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

</li><li> <em>H2Overdrive</em> was going to be a 2003 game by Crave Entertainment, unrelated to the 2009 game of the same name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo Online</a></em> was going to be a Halo MMO, developed by Ensemble Studios, and was canceled in 2008.

</li><li> <em>Halo: Chronicles</em> by WingNut Interactive would have been an episodic series of games with interactive storytelling. Peter Jackson was going to be involved, but according to him, the project collapsed when the <em>Halo</em> movie was cancelled.
</li><li> Origin Systems Inc. had secured the rights to make a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> Online</em> in the late 90s, but the project was scrapped. Note that this predated both the movies and the last three books, meaning that it would have been very different from Pottermore.
</li><li> When the licencing for <em>Harry Potter</em> became available, Nintendo actually tried to get it. In an attempt to get the licence, they ended up suspending (and ultimately cancelling) production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer">Ridge Racer</a> 64</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a> 64</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crystalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crystalis">Crystalis</a></em> to do so. There were arguments on if they should either go with the British cover-style artwork or a more Japanese anime-styling. Ultimately, it proved for naught as Warner Brothers got the licence since they also included film and TV.
</li><li> Of particular note is the long promised, but still missing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a>. Online connectivity (read: the ability to buy, sell, and trade items between other players) has also been long promised since <em>Save The Homeland</em> debuted. It finally appeared in limited form in <em>Island Of Happiness</em> via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>' WiFi.

The game was cancelled in 2010 by the publisher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a>. The game was repeatedly postponed and pushed back until the company making it was sold in 2011 and the new owners ultimately pulled the plug.
</li><li> <em>Highlander: The Gathering</em>, known as <em>Highlander Online</em>, was an MMORPG in development by Kalisto Entertainment around 2001-2002.

</li><li> <em>Hero's Journey</em> was going to be a fantasy MMORPG by Simutronics, using the HeroEngine, and was canceled in 2009.

</li><li> <em>Imperator Online</em>, by Mythic Entertainment, was going to be a sci-fi MMO where Roman and Mayan civilizations developed space travel, and was canceled in 2005.
</li><li> The graphic adventure <em>Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix</em>, a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IndianaJonesAndTheFateOfAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IndianaJonesAndTheFateOfAtlantis">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</a></em>, was never produced except for a comic book tie-in. One reason for its cancellation was the worry that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">No Swastikas</a> version could not be produced for Germany, as the plot involved Nazis using the Philosopher's Stone to resurrect Hitler.

The game appeared to be caught in the development hell of constantly trying to stay up-to-date for years; the development newsfeed was composed almost entirely of graphical changes. The game was later canceled and its engine (I-Novae) offered for licensing with a <em>much</em> more reasonably sized game, <em>Infinity: Battlescape</em> on the horizon.

Unfortunately, its publisher, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/THQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/THQ">THQ</a>, was falling apart at the time, and in 2012 they canceled the game, with the IP rights going to del Toro; they ultimately went bankrupt four months later, and were dissolved the following year. Given del Toro's subsequent work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHills">Silent Hills</a></em> (which met the same fate), it's unlikely that the game will ever be finished.

<ul><li> An issue of <em>Nintendo Power</em> revealed to readers a <em>Super Kid Icarus</em> title coming to the SNES. Never mentioned again and no photos or footage exists.
</li><li> <em>Icarus</em> was going to be a game for the Wii made by Factor 5, the creators of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Rogue Squadron</a></em> game series. The game would have followed an older Pit who could fly without aid. The game would have been more mature, with Pit's design reflecting that. Nintendo rejected it since they felt the game was too much of a departure from the series, and even former Factor 5 developers felt they were missing the point.

However, Nex shut down in 2016, so Fields, a company known more for pachinko machines than video games, picked it up. In September 2017, Fields announced that development of the game had been called off, and future plans for it were uncertain.
</li><li> <em>Killing Day</em> was a game announced by Ubisoft for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and ended up being cancelled in 2005.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>:
<ul><li> There were supposed to be three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> games for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">GameCube</a>: A four-player simultaneous game known as <em>Kirby Adventure</em>, a 2.5D or 3D platformer involving movement in 3D space, and a game involving an animated Kirby in a pop-up book with new Copy abilities that can be powered up. One is known by fans as <em>Kirby: Legend of the Stars</em>. They never materialized on that system, but in late 2011, features from all three ended up in the Wii game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand">Kirby's Return to Dream Land</a></em>, to the fanbase's delight. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyStarAllies">Kirby Star Allies</a></em> would also introduce the triple helper system proper.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies">Spinoff Babies</a> <em>Kirby</em> game with the working title of "Kid Kirby" was planned for release on the SNES, developed by DMA Design (who had earlier collaborated with Nintendo on <em>Uniracers</em>). It had CGI-rendered sprites, a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>, and would have featured Kirby as a curly-haired (!) baby and King Dedede as a young child. For one reason or another, it never got beyond a few promotional renders and level layouts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Kumite</em>, a 3D <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionCapture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionCapture">Motion Capture</a> of martial artists and realistic damage modeling, was have been published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a>. The game design proved too ambitious for its small third-party developer, a company known as 47-TEK, to bring anywhere near to completion.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series has had a long history of finessing out of development and legal complications. However, its admirable run ended tragically with the cancellation of the sixth installment, to be titled <em>Legacy of Kain: Dark Prophecy</em> or <em>Dead Sun</em>, after only three months in development. Only some concept art remains as evidence of its existence before evaporation. The game was intended to tie up all the loose ends from the series. Unfortunately: 1. Amy Hennig, the lead writer of the series, left Crystal Dynamics. 2. The person Hennig left in charge died before someone else could be chosen. 3. Crystal Dynamics was given the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series. And the first <em>LoK</em> sequel, <em>Soul Reaver</em>, was originally intended to have a different conclusion, rather than a cliffhanger. This is evident in a number of sound files on the disc of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version of the game relating to an actual death of Kain followed by the apparent use of a giant cathedral organ to destroy all of the remaining vampires in Nosgoth. Afterward, though, he would've learnt that the Elder God was evil all along and this ending would lead into a different version of Soul Reaver 2. Also the concept of Wraith Blade being Raziel's soul was there from the start, but not to be realized in any version of Soul Reaver.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfElLobodestroyoVsLaLigaDeLosVillanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfElLobodestroyoVsLaLigaDeLosVillanos">The Legend of el Lobodestroyo Vs. la Liga de los Villanos</a></em> (originally just titled <em>Lobodestroyo</em>) is a 3D platformer announced in 2013 for the Wii U. It stars a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> luchador wolf and is based on classic 3D platformers like <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>. Not much has been shown off besides a few test animations and music, however it's still in development as of 2016. The developers are doing it in their free time for no profit, so the game's development is taking a long time.
</li><li> Traveler's Tales had planned a few other LEGO games. First was an attempt to make a LEGO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> series. However, while the various rights holders were on board with the idea, the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em> scuttled that idea as they realized the Bond franchise was going into a darker angle. They also attempted a LEGO <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a> game, but when they felt the franchise couldn't hold itself up by itself, they attempted to have her as a guest star in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOIndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOIndianaJones">LEGO Indiana Jones</a></em>. When Lucasarts learned of Lara and that she was a ripoff of Indiana, they furiously refused to let them do so.
</li><li> <em>Lejendary Adventure Online</em>, or <em>Lejendary Adventure</em>, was going to be an MMO based on Gary Gygax's other RPG. The game was in development in 2002, with no word given on its cancellation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LilyBergamo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LilyBergamo">Lily Bergamo</a></em> was announced in 2013 as a "super action game" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Suda51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Suda51">Suda51</a>, featuring artwork by Yusuke Kozaki. One trailer was released before the game re-surfaced in 2014 as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LetItDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LetItDie">Let It Die</a></em>, which is... very different than the initial product.
</li><li> <em>Line's End</em>, the sequel to the freeware RPG, <em>A Blurred Line</em>, has been eluding expectations of a conclusion to A Blurred Line's engrossing story for several years. The creator seems to have abandoned it in favor of a career in law. While he promised <a class="urllink" href="http://rpgmaker.net/games/93/?p=3#comments">to finish it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in August 2010, as of 2014 though, nothing further has been heard so it's looking very unlikely that this game will ever be finished.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> HUB</em>, a free-to-play installment in the <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> series, was announced back in 2013. Whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Steven Isbell</a> was asked about it, he responded that the team was working on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> DLC (in 2013) or LittleBigPlanet 3 (in 2014) or that there was just no new info. Content from that game later appeared in LBP3's Seaside Surprise DLC in 2016, and the Challenges feature that was set to make an appearance in <em>HUB</em> was added to LBP3 in an update, making it highly unlikely that the game is still a thing.
</li><li> <em>LMNO</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArkaneStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArkaneStudios">Arkane Studios</a> was going to be a first person parkour game with adventure and RPG elements, with the involvement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, and was cancelled in 2010.

Very little info was released before it was cancelled. A prototype was eventually found and a ROM dumped.
<ul><li> Kemco also announced a Lobo game for the Xbox. That was it. No screenshots were ever released and Kemco eventually announced it was cancelled with no work whatsoever having been done on the game.
</li></ul></li><li> A sandbox PC game called <em>Loose Cannon</em>, developed by Sinister Games, was supposed to come out in 2002. The main character in the game would have had the freedom to explore a detailed city, take missions and drive vehicles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Sounds familiar</a>? This game was canned too.
</li><li> <em>The Lost</em> by Irrational Games and FXLabs was going to be a third person shooter survival horror game to be released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a>, and was instead released on PC in India as <em>Agni: Queen of Darkness</em> with redone art.
</li><li> <em>Love Despite</em> was going to be another spiritual successor to <em>Katawa Shoujo</em> (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MissingStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MissingStars">Missing Stars</a></em> down below) that began development in January 2012, immediately after <em>Katawa Shoujo</em>'s release. However, development news were very scarce, despite the creators setting up a very elaborate <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801190239/http://love-despite.com/">website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (archived link). That site was made to look like the official web page of the fictional academy the game was going to be set in. However, it stopped updating in 2014, the project was cancelled a little later, and in 2016 that page was turned into a general web page for the dev team, renamed Unfinished Circle. Even <em>that</em> one, though, stopped any updates after the very first post, leaving all the team's projects unfinished.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em> fan-game <em>Love Letter: My True Feelings</em> started off with high anticipation by the former game's disgruntled fanbase, as while its inspiration <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">had been in development for 6 years with no end in sight</a>, <em>Love Letter</em> was billed as having been developed in 2 weeks. Trouble began to brew when the main artist for the game Shortcake left the team due to infighting, taking all of their character designs with them. The final nail in the coffin came when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">allegations of child grooming were made against project leader DrApeis</a>. The game was cancelled on September 23rd 2020; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">it never even saw a demo release</a>.
</li><li> LucasArts Team Three studio came up with ideas for five or six <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> games, including an animal-based platformer, a photo-examining detective game, and Caveland, a downloadable shooting game.

Knowing EA's reputation for rushing out yearly installments and not caring about the final product as long it sells well; when they say a game is unworthy of being published, you know something is really wrong. The main problem is that it suffered a same fate as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JurassicParkTrespasser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JurassicParkTrespasser">Jurassic Park: Trespasser</a></em>, it was just too ambitious for the technology at time. The game was heavily hyped by Sony and judging by the pre-release images, it looked great, until it was later revealed that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.game-rave.com/psx_galleries/unreleased_madden96/magazines/demo.jpg">EA ''doctored'' the images<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.

<ul><li> <em>MechWarrior Tactics</em> Another "free to play", though given its Closed Beta status, requiring either winning a free Beta key via Lottery pick, or paying money for a founders package for instant access, it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">Allegedly Free Game</a>, from Infinite Games Publishing (who published <em>Online</em> with Piranha Games as Developers). They assigned it to 3 different development teams. (Roadhouse Interactive, ACRONYM Games, who both worked togther, then were sacked, replaced with Blue Lizard games). All news for the game ended in January of the 2014, with the beta stagnating. Then the game, and website went down on August 18th, 2014, citing Extended server maintenance and hardware upgrades, which lasted more than the listed time frame of 72 hours. Questions began being asked, and it was found out that Blue Lizard Games had also left quietly from making the game back in December of 2013. A month latter, in September 2014 after the game went down, IGP <em>finally</em> replied admitting the truth everyone already knew about there being no developers, while at the same time, now informing everyone the game had no servers now to run it. Despite the fact that fans had pieced together the fact that IGP was looking to close its doors for good, what with its CEO leaving to start <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">video game consulting firm</a></em> and that 90% of IGP had been fired, let go, or quit, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">insisted that Tactics was "Still in development" and that they were looking to get a 4th development team, and new servers to continue the project</a> as an excuse as to why they wouldn't refund angered customers money they spent for founders packages or on the C-bill premium transaction store during Beta, (also claiming that the "money had already been spent" despite failing to deliver on their end). On November 26th, the final truth has come out, as both Infinite Games Publishings website, and MechWarrior Tactic's website were both quietly shutdown, with still zero updates on either Facebook pages, and a sale of remaining assets was posted online. The game was supposed to be launched in 2012, according to IGP's own marketing, even claiming it had already been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">successful launch on its website</a>.

One speculation was that creator Capcom had lost the source code for the original games. Eventually, Capcom declared it too expensive to produce, and that the GBA was in decline anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a> 3</em> wound up being <a class="urllink" href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/devroom/blog/2011/07/18/a_message_from_capcom">unceremoniously cancelled in July 2011<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, after a promising start from positive fan reception, eventually culminating in Capcom's own disappointment in the project, without even releasing the prototype/prologue that was supposed to be used to judge whether the final game would sell.
</li><li> <em>Mega Man Universe</em> was another <em>Mega Man</em> title cancelled around the same time as <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. It would have been a 2D sidescroller with a level creator in the vein of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em>, and would have allowed you to customize your Mega Man's appearance as well as play as other characters (i.e. Bad Box Art Mega Man and Ryu from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a>). Capcom cancelled the game citing poor reception from testers.
</li><li> <em>Rockman Online</em>, a Korean <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> MMORPG that was announced in 2010. It was ultimately cancelled in 2013 after developer Neowiz underwent internal restructuring.

A handful of teasers were released, &mdash; including a few with Christian Erickson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise">reprising his role</a> as Lance Boyle, as well teasers for some apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch">merch</a> like a Lance Boyle figure, and a replica of the robot servant in the original game's intro &mdash; but the last anyone has heard about the project was an announcement for an IndieGoGo campaign in 2015, which also never seemed to materialize.
</li><li> <em>Metal Gear Solid: Rising</em> was first unveiled in E3 2009 as one of two projects that would serve as a follow-up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em> alongside the PSP game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>. The goal was to test Kojima Productions' ability to produce a new console Metal Gear entry without creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s direction, while Kojima himself would oversee the next portable installment instead. However, the resulting product did not meet the desired expectations and the project ended up being outsourced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames">PlatinumGames</a>. Their version of the game, titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em>, (which was released in early 2013), ended up being radically different from the initial concept.
</li><li> Ports of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em> trilogy for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> were announced coming off the success of <em>Metal Slug Advance</em>. Despite its near completion of the first game, it was ultimately canned due to memory constraints and the fact that its late release date on the system and the near release <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Metal Slug Anthology</a></em> would've made the GBA ports obsolete. Efforts were then shifted to create <em>Metal Slug 7</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Metroid: Dread</em> was hinted at in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> series, and since then, every fan has been demanding to know its status or quick to assume any upcoming title will be <em>Dread</em>. With the announcement of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>, the first thing Nintendo did was state that it was not, in fact, <em>Dread</em> under another name (<em>Dread</em> was supposed to take place after <em>Metroid Fusion</em> while <em>Other M</em> takes place <em>before</em> it and after <em>Super Metroid</em> (the cutscene containing a 3D remake of the final battle of the latter game makes this clear)), and were coy that such a game was ever even under development. Later, they claimed that it definitely existed, but had been "shelved indefinitely" during work on <em>Other M</em>. More recent interviews have stated that <em>Dread</em> exists, without a doubt, but no further details about which studio will work on it, where in the timeline it will fit, or when work on it will resume have been released. As of 2017, we're still no closer to knowing anything about it; the only new games revealed and/or released since <em>Other M</em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeFederationForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeFederationForce">a spinoff</a> set between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns">a remake</a> of <em>Metroid II</em> in the vein of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em>, and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.
</li><li> <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> itself has also landed in a rough spot. The game was confirmed to be in development during Nintendo's presentation at E3 2017, but no further details were revealed until January 2019, where it was announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios">Retro Studios</a> would be taking over development from an unknown team. The game's production has been completely rebooted as a result, leaving its future uncertain.

Prior to this, Her Interactive would release one or two games per year and they have repeatedly announced release dates for <em>Midnight in Salem</em>, only to move it.

The project is still a thing as of 2018 however, much like <em>Katawa Shoujo</em>, it has a long and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>. Its first demo was released in January of 2017 however it was clearly rushed, with several typos and a few interface issues.
</li><li> The Game Boy Advance game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterForce">Monster Force</a></em> was originally announced for the PlayStation. The PlayStation version was quietly canceled before the release of the Game Boy Advance version, all that was shown of the former being a trailer and a brief tech demo video.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> initially began development as a particularly ambitious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64DD</a> title with a bigger world and a storyline that was to focus on ten different main characters over the course of ten years. Several familiar characters were present in the screenshots, but with noticeably different designs: Flint had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">Badass Longcoat</a>, Duster seemed to be a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Link</a>, Kumatora's getup was surprisingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a>, and DCMC had a female vocalist. The game was also built around the console's 64DD add-on, which would add to the game's replay value by including, among other things, an internal clock that would affect certain actions in-game. The commercial failure of the 64DD (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare">in the N64's final days, many years and countless abandoned-for-cart games after its originally intended release</a>) put a huge damper on the title's completion, as did the development team's inexperience with 3D games. The project was officially canned in 2000 after six years' worth of delays, but it eventually got picked up again to be retooled for the Game Boy Advance. And even when the game was shifted to the GBA, the game's storyline and gameplay went through a ton of changes. Among several examples, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">Tanetane Island</a> as seen in the final version is toned down compared to what it was in development, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Itoi found it too scary</a>, Flint was going to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill the Mecha-Drago instead of sparing it</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Porky</span> was going to die, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> sprites imply Kumatora was going to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final Magypsy instead of Fassad</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Claus's death and cyborgification (into a Starman, unlike the final version)</span> was going to be clearly seen.
</li><li> <em>Mythica</em> was going to be a Norse mythology fantasy MMORPG by Microsoft Game Studios, and was cancelled in 2004.
</li><li> Another classic that promised a never-to-appear sequel like the previously mentioned <em>Commander Keen</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom">Infocom</a>'s take on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>, potentially called <em>Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em>. Delays, including the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a></em> (also written by Douglas Adams), meant the game was delayed, with Infocom eventually going bankrupt before the sequel could be made. All that is left to show for it are some of Douglas Adams' notes and a very, <em>very</em> small amount of code with nothing more than a few locations on the surface of Magrathea, only two of which have any description whatsoever. All of the code, what little there is, is playable online <a class="urllink" href="http://waxy.org/random/software/milliways/milliways_release15.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

</li><li> <em>Mr. Bill's Neighborhood</em> for the Atari 2600 would had been <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBill">Mr. Bill</a></em>'s first video game if it was released. Yet, this game was 100% complete and ready to be released but was cancelled due to the publisher, Data Age, couldn't afford to pay the licensing fees after their license game Journey Escape's poor critical reception.
</li><li> Several CD-i games based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> franchise were planned at one point, but only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotelMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotelMario">Hotel Mario</a></em> was ever released. Among the canned titles were <em>Super Mario's Wacky Worlds</em>, a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> with stages set in various real-world locations, and <em>Mario Takes America</em>, an FMV game that would feature a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerRabbitEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogerRabbitEffect">Roger Rabbit Effect</a> Mario traveling from New York to Hollywood to film a movie while getting in various state-themed shenanigans along the way.
</li><li> <em>Marvel Universe Online</em> / <em>Marvel Universe</em>, by Cryptic Studios, was a cancelled Marvel MMORPG. Some assets were later used to develop <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a></em> was to have sequels <em>Mercs Inc.</em> and <em>Mercenaries 3: No Limits</em>.
</li><li> <em>Midnight Animal,</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod">approved</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel">Fan Sequel</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a> 2</em>, first underwent an art-shift, and then a genre-shift to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novel</a> called <em>The Story of Love and Forgetting,</em> and then... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">whatever</a> <em>The Document of Midnight Animal</em> is. You can trace the tech demos and teasers if you know where to look, start with Youtube.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> has been modded by the community basically since it launched, and the developers (Mojang) acknowledged this by committing to developing an official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ApplicationProgrammingInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ApplicationProgrammingInterface">Application Programming Interface</a> for the game. Mojang went as far as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/news/417-bukkit-officially-joins-mojang/">recruiting the lead developers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the community-made API <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bukkit.org">Bukkit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to lead the project. Within a few months, they established a <a class="urllink" href="http://dev.minecraft.net/blog/">blog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and public <a class="urllink" href="https://github.com/Mojang/Minecraft-API">Github<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and then proceeded to go silent. Neither the blog nor the Github have seen activity in nearly a year; and the Github does not even exist anymore. The devs have made mention of the API on Reddit several times since then, but there's no word on if it's still being actively worked on.
</li><li> On the fraud front comes <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17915305">Mythic: The Story of Gods and Men<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, an entirely fake game fabricated and promoted with media from other, existing games just to raise funds for the project. Fortunately, it was exposed and the contributed funds returned.
</li><li> <em>MySims Social</em> was to be another social game similar to <em>The Sims Social</em> and <em>SimCity Social</em>.
</li><li> <em>Mythri</em> was an indie RPG by Team XKalibur initially announced for the Gameboy Color in 2000 that first received press when news site RPGamer began covering it and started a campaign to get a publisher for it. Variant Interactive eventually signed on board and the project jumped from the outdated (by 2003) GBC to the then-viable GBA, complete with comparison screenshots of improved graphical engine updates. After two years with absolutely no updates, news eventually trickled out that Variant had dropped the game and Team XKalibur was once more seeking a publisher. The game was finally quietly cancelled. Not long after, the developer was disbanded and the staff scattered across the industry.

<ul><li> <em>NBA Live 13</em> was going to be a planned reboot of the series before being cancelled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">EA</a>.
</li><li> <em>Necessary Force</em>, an open-world action game set in a dystopian future about a police detective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">going rogue</a>. It was in development at Midway's England studios at the time of its bankruptcy, and neither the game nor its studio were part of the Midway assets sold to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> (save for the studio's <em>Wheelman</em> game). Midway unveiled the game in the hopes of finding a buyer for the studio, but nobody was interested, resulting in the studio being shuttered and everyone working on the game being let go. Not helping matters is that nobody knows who owns the <em>Necessary Force</em> IP or game code because of Midway's liquidation, leaving the game permanently unfinished.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>: In 2009, there was talk of a possible third expansion and another patch for the game, but everything went down the drain when Hasbro (owner of the D&amp;D license) sued Atari (the game's publisher). By the time the dispute was settled everybody had moved on to other games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusTheJupiterIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusTheJupiterIncident">Nexus: The Jupiter Incident</a></em>, produced by Mithis and HD Publishing, released way back in 2005, was scheduled to have a <em>Nexus 2</em> come out later in 2007. That year has long since passed. Many claim that no ship-to-ship space combat sim produced since has ever rivaled it, yet only a crusty layer of dust-caked die-hards can even remember its name. This is probably past vaporware by now... Interestingly, concept video of Nexus 2 was posted to Youtube in 2012. Supposedly the project had been in the works for some time, and in 2012 a small Kickstarter was attempted for the project.
</li><li> Freeware space exploration simulator <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.anywherebb.com/">Noctis IV<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> saw a good (and justified, given how an entire galaxy was squeezed in 700 kilobytes of data) popularity in the early 2000s; the author announced <em>Noctis V</em>, a version with native Windows support, a renewed engine and many more new features and adjustments, around that time. For a while, it completely fell off the radar, and contributions to the NIV starmap weren't even included in the game anymore. Then, support to NIV resumed and its source code was released, but as of July 2009 (when the author once again assured that he hasn't given up on the project), NV <em>still</em> hasn't come out, while the older iteration shows more and more the signs of its age (like complete lack of sound, a very cumbersome interface, and low resolution).
</li><li> Several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld">Oddworld</a></em> projects were announced and went unreleased: <em>The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot</em>, <em>Oddworld: Squeek's Oddysee</em>, <em>Oddworld: Munch's Exoddus</em>, online RTS <em>Oddworld: The Hand of Odd</em>, <em>Oddworld: Slave Circus</em>, <em>Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath 2</em>, <em>SligStorm</em>, and <em>Stranger Arena</em>.
</li><li> Quantic Dream had originally planned on making a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OmikronTheNomadSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OmikronTheNomadSoul">Omikron: The Nomad Soul</a></em> called <em>Nomad Soul: Exodus</em>. However tensions between Quantic Dream and Eidos forced them to scrap it. A few years later they announced yet another sequel, this time called <em>Omikron 2: Karma</em>. Once again, the project was put on hold so Quantic Dream could focus on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em>. Given the long developmental cycles their games tend to have, who knows when&mdash;or if&mdash;Omikron 2 will actually see the light of day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Omori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Omori">Omori</a></em> is a RPG Maker surreal psychological horror title in the vein of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki">Yume Nikki</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> being developed by artist Omocat and a small team of developers. A Kickstarter for the game was opened in early 2014 and was met with a resounding success, but then updates on the project became rather scarce. As of early 2017, a new trailer was shown, but <a class="urllink" href="http://omori-game.com/#updates">the updates page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on the official site mention a change in the game's engine, and also reworking of several story and graphics elements, without even a tentative release date. A demo release in April 2018 proved that it was at least still in the works, but it's no closer to a release date than it was in 2014.
</li><li> <em>Otoiroha</em> was a rhythm game in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani">BEMANI</a> series that was shown off at JAEPO 2016 that featured a touch screen and panels that could be slid up and down the cabinet, similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex">Sound Voltex</a></em>'s analog dials. After its one location test, nothing was heard of the game for about a year; in late January 2017, its website was pulled from Konami's eAMUSE portal site. At JAEPO 2017, it was stated that while the game isn't officially canceled, development is on hold and they're unsure whether or not to continue.
<ul><li> With the original songs made for the game being ported to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReflecBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReflecBeat">Reflec Beat</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat">Jubeat</a></em>, it's looking more likely that Konami really has pulled the plug.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Outsider</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> espionage game by David Braben's (of <em>Elite</em> fame) Frontier Developments was cancelled in 2011 after a protracted development cycle and being dumped by publisher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Codemasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Codemasters">Codemasters</a>. Interestingly, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/10/11/source-frontiers-canned-the-outsider-project-was-actually-t/">the game was described as being practically complete apart from QA testing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. At the same time Braben's studio was in talks with EA about retooling the game into an adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheBourneSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheBourneSeries">The Bourne Series</a></em> since they held the rights at the time. All that exists of the game now are a few trailers and screenshots.
</li><li> <em>Paprium</em>, a side-scrolling beat'em-up made for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> by Watermelon, the same people who released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PierSolarAndTheGreatArchitects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PierSolarAndTheGreatArchitects">Pier Solar and the Great Architects</a></em> for that system, required four years of development but still isn't ready to see the light of the day. Pre-orders have been launched in late 2017, but apparently problems with PayPal caused even more delays and there's talks of refunds from the devs. Watermelon's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/watermelon/no-news-good-news/1733376676730002/">Facebook page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/exclusive_the_artist_behind_troubled_sega_mega_drive_fighter_paprium_speaks_out">this article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> have more info about it. However, it seems that the Paypal affair is an excuse and the game is never going to get completed, as the page "<a class="urllink" href="https://papriumfiasco.wordpress.com/">Paprium Fiasco<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" documents.
<ul><li> A third game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> series, <em>Perfect Dark Core</em>, was planned and entered development around 2007, but was cancelled in 2008 before even making it past the prototype stage. Even by then the idea had shifted so wildly it wasn't even a <em>Perfect Dark</em> game anymore, centering around a male protagonist fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The fourth main installment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em> was revealed to be "very close to completion" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> on September 2015. No details or footage regarding the game have come out ever since, save for Nintendo reconfirming its development in 2017 (with the spinoff title <em>Hey! Pikmin</em> releasing that same year).
</li><li> <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned</em>, by Propaganda Games / Disney Interactive Studios, was a cancelled action-adventure role-playing game in an open world with land and sea combat, set before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl">The Curse of the Black Pearl</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Planet Michael</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>-based MMORPG, was announced in 2010 for a 2011 release. Nothing's been heard of it since. Even the official website slid to a halt; its latest news blurb was in January 2011.
</li><li> Askiisoft's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PoliceTeamKazuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PoliceTeamKazuo">Police Team Kazuo</a></em>, supposedly a 2D tactical strategy game that was announced in 2014 and still "coming soon". The <a class="urllink" href="http://askiisoft.com/games/police-team-kazuo/">official site<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is empty, Askiisoft's site doesn't mention it and all its social media pages (<a class="urllink" href="http://greyradian.deviantart.com/journal/Announce-POLICE-TEAM-KAZUO-527389377">found here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) are similarly void of any content. It's safe to say it has quietly been cancelled.
</li><li> <em>Power Drive 2000</em> was to be an '80s themed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Synthwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Synthwave">Synthwave-soundtracked</a> indie racing game funded via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>, and got as far as an alpha build. However, no word has been heard on the project since Feb 2017, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasTheLastEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasTheLastEntry">the developer's last Twitter entry</a> read "Chit-chatting with the lawyers", possibly indicating being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Screwed by the Lawyers</a>.
</li><li> The original DOS release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrincessMaker">Princess Maker</a> 2</em> was planned for a western release by a development company called Softegg and a publisher called Intracorp. Unfortunately, delays, Intracorp's dissolution, the growing obsolecense of MS-DOS, and the dominance of first-person shooters on PC lead to the localization never being released. An English beta of the game leaked onto the internet in the 2010s, although Softegg maintained that they still owned the rights to the localization and asked players not to pirate the beta. Eventually, the near entirety of the <em>Princess Maker</em> series would finally be released in the west via Steam by CFK, starting with the Windows port of <em>Princess Maker 2</em> in 2016.
</li><li> <em>Project Goliath</em> was an attempted pitch to Junction Point, owned by Disney. It would have been the studio's first IP with original characters, a gorilla named Tarek and a girl named Ky in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em>-style 3D platformer where they battle cyborg monsters led by an alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> in an attempt to escape his island. With some inspiration from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em>, the game was meant to focus on themes like family, where Ky ran away from her family due to not getting along and the alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a>, he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a> and creating an army of cyborgs to take revenge on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">the aliens who wiped out his people and his family</a>. Due to the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey">Epic Mickey</a></em>, Junction Point was put to make the sequel right away. Sadly, the sequel wasn't the hit they hoped for and, despite Junction Point's willingness to keep working, was shut down. Though the studio was closed, the team could always pitch to another studio or just keep it as something for work experience. Unfortunately, even this couldn't happen, as one of the artists, a college student, was revealed to have plagiarized much of the art for the game. Thus the designers couldn't even keep the game in their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.
</li><li> Project H.A.M.M.E.R. (or its apparent working title "Machinex") was a game teased by Nintendo Software Technology in Redmond Washington for several years. The game was being developed for the Wii, about a hammer wielding android named "M-09" who smashes his way through an army of robots led by a terrorist organization, the same that originally created him. Notably dark for a Nintendo game, it met a plethora of problems, from arguments between Western and Eastern developers, to the gameplay not being fun, to the poor decision of spending most of its budget on CGI cutscenes. Many who worked on the game have little nice things to say, criticizing the plot, dialogue and the main character, who one developer described "part man, part machine, all mediocre". There was a redesign to make it a cuter, more casual game called "Wii Crush", but the gameplay still didn't improve enough. The game ultimately ended production and is the reason NST no longer makes large scale games.
</li><li> <em>Propeller Arena: Aviation Battle Championship</em>/<em>Propeller Head Online</em> by Sega AM2, for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Dreamcast</a>. It was a World War II airplane combat game with multiplayer deathmatch, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to Wing Arms. The game was actually fully completed and was just about to release when the tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001</a> caused the game to be swiftly canceled. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">It didn't help that the game contained a stage where the planes did battle in a city that resembled modern day New York.</a> The game wasn't lost however, for a bootable disk image of it later got leaked onto the internet and it can be played in its entirety on both an emulator and an actual Dreamcast console by burning the image to a CD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PsiOpsTheMindgateConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PsiOpsTheMindgateConspiracy">Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy</a></em> ended in the middle of a <em>cutscene</em>. A planned sequel was never announced due to a lawsuit suggesting the concept was stolen. Midway won but, by then, it was in great financial trouble, ultimately going into bankruptcy and the current liquidation. It looks like <em>Psi-Ops 2</em> is never going to see the light of day. Also, the game was going to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">GameCube</a> port, titled <em>ESPionage</em>, that was cancelled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RailWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RailWars">Rail Wars!</a></em> was supposed to get a video game adaptation on the PS Vita soon after the Anime version aired in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Summer2014Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Summer2014Anime">summer of 2014</a>. However, the anime tanked, and the project quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">derailed</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> was intended to be released during the spring of 1997, but ended up being revamped from scratch after the designers were unsatisfied with the nearly finished build of their first version (now dubbed <em>Resident Evil 1.5</em>), delaying the game by a whole year. The original version (<em>1.5</em>) had Leon S. Kennedy as the main male protagonist like in the released version, but instead of Claire Redfield, <em>1.5</em> had Elza Walker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">a college student/motorcyclist</a> with no relation to Chris Redfield (from the first game) or any other previously existing character. The police station the game was set in looked more like a regular office building in <em>1.5</em> than the art museum-like design of <em>2</em>. A group that had gotten hold of an early build has since compiled a playable ISO image of <em>1.5</em> that can be found online. It's buggy as hell and not even close to a complete game, but sure to please those who've been itching to try <em>1.5</em> ever since news first broke that it was canned.
<ul><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilZero">Resident Evil 0</a></em> was also scrapped halfway through development after it was shown off at TGS and E3 in 2000, so that the game could be developed on Nintendo's succeeding console the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube">GameCube</a>. Unlike <em>1.5</em>, the basic plot of the game remained the same in the finished version and the changes were primarily visuals, as Capcom upgraded the graphics to bring in more in-like with the <em>Resident Evil</em> remake that was being developed at the same time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> was canned at about 90% completion. Two ROM images were eventually released online, and even though both are unfinished, it's possible to play through almost the whole game between the two beta images. The UK's official Nintendo magazine actually ran a review for the Game Boy Color port of the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, as it was canned so close to release that it was by all accounts actually finished. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilGaiden">Resident Evil Gaiden</a></em> was launched as a replacement, and the <em>RE1</em> port languished in oblivion until <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/GameBoy/Resident+Evil+GBC/news.asp?c=37656">a prototype was finally discovered and ROM-dumped in 2012.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <em>Gaiden</em>'s ending showed that Leon was the parasite B.O.W., which implied that the real Leon was either missing or dead. Naturally, the game is considered non-canon for various reasons, one of them being Leon appearing to be alive and well in future games.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ringworld">Ringworld</a></em> adventure games <em>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</em> and <em>Return to Ringworld</em> were to be followed by a third game, <em>Ringworld: Within ARM's Reach</em>.
</li><li> <em>Rizminance</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6wvde');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6wvde" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6wvde');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">also known as <em>Saikyo DJ Anikurage</em></span>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani">BEMANI</a> arcade game with a soundtrack consisting of anime song remixes/covers, seems to have gone down the same path as <em>Otoiroha</em> above. The game received two location tests in September and November of 2018, but doesn't even have so much as a teaser page up on Konami's website. It was totally absent at JAEPO 2019, with no mention of the game beyond some of its remixes being brought to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat">Jubeat</a></em>. The hardware used for the game's machines would go on to be repurposed for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopnMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopnMusic">Popn Music</a>: Welcome to Wonderland!</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a>: Crystal Dreams</em>, a space fighter simulator for the N64, slipped into vaporware oblivion when its developer, Gametek, went belly-up. Only a ROM of the demo version exists. The game would have been localized in Japan as <em>The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Another Dimension</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntarcticPress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntarcticPress">Antarctic Press</a> also published a tie-in comic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rochard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rochard">Rochard</a></em>'s creators, Recoil Games, began work on a sequel, but were forced to shelve it due to lack of funding. By all indications, the company has ceased operations altogether.
</li><li> This appears to what has happened to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a> Japan</em>. In June 2008, Harmonix said they were codeveloping the game with Q Entertainment for Japanese release, featuring popular Japanese artists. The next time it was brought up was to announce its cancellation.
</li><li> A Xbox and Playstation 2 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a> Zero Gravity Zone</em> was in production, but it was canned in 2003 for unknown reasons. Vision Scape Interactive tried to salvage the product by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">revamping it</a>, including pitching a <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> version called <em>Sonic Extreme</em> to Sega, and it was ultimately revamped into the PC game <em>Bare Knuckle Grind</em>.

If they couldn't get <em>Star Wars</em>, EA would have then went on to make a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> MMO along with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">Silmarillion</a></em> MMO. There were even plans for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfThrones">A Game of Thrones</a></em> MMO.

Not much is known what it would have, as in early 2012 it was put on "indefinite hold" as GSC was forced to close down due to massive financial issues. GSC has since reopened and in May 16th, 2018 they announced that the game was back in development and intended to release it around 2021.
</li><li> <em>Sadness</em> for the Wii was announced so long ago that Nintendo's machine was still called the Revolution at that point. During "development" of the game, Nibris came under heavy criticism for not producing any evidence of any development, no images, demos, gameplay trailers, etc. All Nibris has to show for it is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NlBRlS">some concept artwork<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nibris.net/news.html">broken promises<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In the end, <a class="urllink" href="http://gonintendo.com/viewstory.php?id=139668">Nibris stopped develping games<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> Someone who was working on Sadness revealed many years later that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">production was extremely troublesome</a> and that the only things completed were the script, concept art and one in-game object, a minecart. In 2014, Hull Breach Studios and Cthulhi Games had plans to develop the game (as a 2D <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> release) and even announced the project on their website, but not long afterwards, it was said that the rights for Sadness are, confusingly, either not for sale or in a bidding war, and that there are 4 companies competing for the rights of the IP. The game seemed promising, and since Nibris was terribly incompetent with the development of the game, it would be better for another company to make it anyway. There is a possibility of the game surfacing after more than a decade, but who knows if that will actually happen. There is also a chance of it being different from the original concept; like mentioned above, they wanted to change the graphics to 2D.

<ul><li> The series designer was working on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> open world game that was cancelled.
</li><li> Preceding that was <em>Saints Row Undercover</em> (or <em>Saints Row: The Fall</em>), a sequel to <em>Saints Row 2</em> for the PSP. It was canceled in 2009, but an (incredibly glitchy) test ISO was released for download by Volition in 2015.
</li><li> <em>Saints Row: Money Shot</em> was a rail shooter tie-in to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em>, for Xbox 360 and PS3 but also, interestingly, the 3DS. It entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> in 2011 when THQ closed its studio in Phoenix; later it was announced that the game would be free-to-play on the Playstation Network, but nothing has come of that (and probably never will as THQ has been bankrupt since 2013). A mostly-complete version of the game has been leaked, but the full game will never see the light of day.

</li><li> In 2004, there was supposed to be a sequel to the popular PC game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxHitTheRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxHitTheRoad">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a></em>, titled simply <em>Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police!!</em>. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> cancelled the game, stating that there wasn't a market for its kind of game. This would lead to the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a>, who made the episodic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice">Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em> games, and the would-be game would be referenced as probably one of the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incidents</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxFreelancePolice">Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police</a></em>, a 3D <em>Sam &amp; Max</em> game that was to be published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> and released in 2004, and even <strong>finished development and got rated by the ESRB</strong>, was infamously cancelled because LucasArts claimed that "no one would be interested in the project", and fired most of their "creative division" as a result. Some of those people in the "creative division" went on to forming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoubleFine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoubleFine">Double Fine</a>, while the others went on to forming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a>, who would later remake the 3D <em>Sam &amp; Max</em> project. The rest is history.
<ul><li> <em>Sam &amp; Max Plunge Through Space</em> would've been an <em>action game</em> rather than a point-and-click adventure, and was going to be released for Xbox. The developing company went under about six months later, and so they pulled the plug on the project. To this very day, not much is known about the project.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs">Sammy vs. Capcom</a></em> was a potential crossover with Sammy corporation, described as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> with the look of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em>.

</li><li> <em>Seed</em>, by Runestone Game Development, was a cel-shaded, "role play-centric" sci-fi MMO, set in a terraforming colony, focusing on cooperative projects, politics and crafting. It was cancelled in 2006 shortly after beta.
</li><li> <em>Seiken Densetsu: The Emergence of Excalibur</em> was a Famicom Disk System title that was planned to span five disks. What makes this entry so bizarre is that pre-orders were placed <em>before one line of code could be typed</em> because of a clever marketing campaign that involved very convincing-looking mock-ups. It was apparently unrelated to the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfMana">World of Mana</a></em> games except for the title.

</li><li> After severing ties with Banpresto, Winkysoft, developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsGaiden">Super Robot Wars Gaiden</a></em>, created a similar game called <em>Seireiki Rayblade</em>. In 2001 they announced a sequel... Which hasn't come out yet, despite the official site being updated every few years. With the release of Duke Nukem Forever, it held the dubious honor of being the oldest unabandoned videogame project until 2015, when <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2015/12/01/the-end-of-an-era-as-winkysoft-files-for-bankruptcy/#3dd5ef1a6ece">Winkysoft filed for<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> bankrupcy, making it very unlikely it will see the light of day.
</li><li> There was a sequel planned for the Macintosh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> <em>Sensory Overload</em> (which came out about the same time as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>), but development apparently never commenced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowgate">Shadowgate</a> Rising</em> was fairly close to complete as another Nintendo 64 installment in the franchise, but the GameCube's imminent release coupled with the middling reception <em>Shadowgate 64</em> had garnered both combined to seal its fate.
</li><li> <em>Shadow of Atlantis</em>, first in development for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> and later for the 32X, was ultimately canceled in 1997.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowRealms">Shadow Realms</a></em> was originally going to be a 4 versus 1 multiplayer action RPG by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> Austin.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue">Shenmue</a></em>:
<ul><li> In several gaming magazines, it was mentioned that the story for <em>Shenmue</em> would be spanning a total of <em>25</em> games, one for each year Ryo would have spent on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">quest for revenge</a>. <em>Yowza</em>. This was condensed down into 25 chapters, with each game having multiple chapters (for instance, the first game was chapter 1, the second game had 3-5 or so, the 2nd chapter being in an unshown part of the games). This was still a lot more than what was fit into the two games that saw release.
</li><li> It was also going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> game at first; Ryo has a Saturn in his house as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to this, despite the game being set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">about a decade before the Saturn existed</a>.
</li><li> It was also originally going to be a game set in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter">Virtua Fighter</a></em> universe, with Akira Yuki as the main character.
</li><li> A <em>Shenmue Online</em> MMORPG was planned, but the game appears to have been cancelled, with no mention of it even as a third mainline game was able to be created almost two decades later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShogoMobileArmorDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShogoMobileArmorDivision">Shogo: Mobile Armor Division</a></em> had two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Packs</a>, <em>Shugotenshi</em> and <em>Legacy of the Fallen</em>, neither of which was released due to a sudden drop in sales the month after the main game's release (traditionally blamed on the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>). Rumors of a sequel were substantiated by a tech demo of a new version of the LithTech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine">Game Engine</a> with images labeled "Shogo 2"; unfortunately, LithTech 3.0 turned out to be too buggy to be used in any released game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHills">Silent Hills</a></em>, a hotly anticipated sequel run by a dream team of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro">Guillermo del Toro</a>, was cancelled following Kojima's departure from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>.

It first emerged in late 2014, when an extremely well-received "proof of concept" demo called <em>P.T.</em> put the game on the radars of every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> fan... only for it to become the most high-profile casualty of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">acrimonious breakup</a> between Kojima and publisher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> in 2015. Not only was the game canceled, but the <em>P.T.</em> demo was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">pulled from the PlayStation Store</a>. del Toro (who had been burned before with <em>inSANE</em>, which is described above), Reedus, and gamers alike bemoaned the game's sudden death. After his contract with Konami ended, Kojima reformed his studio as an independent company and would announce a new game for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathStranding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathStranding">Death Stranding</a></em>, featuring del Toro (likeness only) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadsMikkelsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadsMikkelsen">Mads Mikkelsen</a>, much to the excitement of fans.
</li><li> Maxis Software (creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em>) has had a few. First, prior to 1998, <em>SimCity 3000</em> was to be in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/sc3k3d2.html">full 3D<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Then, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> acquired them, they put an end to developing non-Sim products (this included employee personal projects, a sports brand, and much more). Finally, even after the acquisition, two other games, <em>SimMars</em> and <em>SimsVille</em> were scrapped.
</li><li> <em>SimCity</em> was going to be released on the NES, though with the pending release of the SNES development of the port was moved to that console instead.
</li><li> A sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> has occasionally been hinted at, but with no media to back it up. It's also been rumored that they <em>were</em> going to make a sequel at one point, but cancelled it for the GameCube remake instead. Also of note is that said remake, <em>Legends</em>, was slated for a PS2 and PC port as well, but both were cancelled for unstated reasons.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> franchise, there was a Smurfs educational game called <em>Smurf Play &amp; Learn</em> advertised by Coleco that would have been released for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColecoVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColecoVision">ColecoVision</a>, as well as <em>Smurfette's Birthday</em> and <em>Papa Smurf's Treasure Hunt</em>, none of which were ever worked on.
</li><li> A follow-up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManWebOfShadows">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></em> called <em>Spider-Man Classic</em> was planned, with players able to control Spidey or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> as they battled against villains like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Carnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Carnage">Carnage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Mysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Mysterio">Mysterio</a>.

Although game content such as music and level design as well as game engine builds of the game have been publicly released, it's highly unlikely the game in its entire form will ever see the light of day.

A "Coming Soon" section in a Nintendo Power magazine depicted a screenshot from it. The game even got an ESRB rating, but the project was canned because Nintendo knew that there were more kids with Game Boys than teens or adults, and they feared that children would be getting their hands on it. It has been said that Matt Stone and Trey Parker keep a cartridge of this game though.

It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em>Mario Artist: Talent Studio</em> and had similarly low poly graphics. The game was played using a peripheral for the GBA called the "Game Eye" (which was an ultimately never released successor to the Game Boy Camera) where you would take pictures of your face and put them into the game. The game also took advantage of the GBA's E-reader where, upon scanning <em>Animal Crossing</em> cards into the game, that villager would appear in the game (it's also speculated the <em>Mario Party</em> and <em>Pikmin</em> cards would have also been used). <em>Stage Debut</em> never came out but it was an inspiration for the Mii's and it does look a lot like the <em>Tomodachi</em> series.

</li><li> Blizzard never actually canceled it (despite what some people may say) and keep saying they have plans to MAYBE finish the game (hence its "Postponed Indefinitely" status). Whether or not this can be taken as a glimmer of hope is up to you.

</li><li> <em>Star Wars: Rogue Leaders: Rogue Squadron Wii</em> was going to be a Wii compilation by Factor 5, containing the first three <em>Rogue Squadron</em> games, and would have also included Mii lightsaber duels.
</li><li> <em>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron: X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter</em> was going to be an Xbox launch title. The game was planned to be an MMO about warring factions.
</li><li> <em>Star Wars: Smuggler</em>, known as <em>Star Wars: Scum And Villainy</em>, would have focused on a Han Solo style smuggler. The game was cancelled in 2005, and some of the concept art was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em>.

</li><li> <em>Star Wars: Underworld</em> would have been an open world RPG and tie-in to the planned live-action TV series. It became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThirteenThirteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThirteenThirteen">Star Wars: 1313</a></em> when Lucas suggested the bounty hunter protagonist be Boba Fett.

It is unclear how many were titles of projects that were cancelled or were working titles for other projects.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisAvellone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisAvellone">Chris Avellone</a> had a concept for a Star Wars RPG similar to the comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkTimes">Dark Times</a></em>, about a Sith hunting down Jedi during the Imperial era.

In 2014, Disney confirmed they had dropped the <em>Star Wars 1313</em> trademark, though Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has stated some of the unused material may be used for another project.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stonekeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stonekeep">Stonekeep</a></em> was going to be called <em>Brian's Dungeon</em>, with system requirements including a floppy disk drive, 640K ram, a 286 processor, and no required mouse or hard drive. <em>Stonekeep 2: Godmaker</em>, cancelled in 2001, was being developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlackIsleStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlackIsleStudios">Black Isle Studios</a>.

</li><li> <em>Streets Of Rage 4</em> was one of the games announced for the Dreamcast but was eventually cancelled because the president of Sega of America <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">had never heard of the franchise before and therefore, the fans wouldn't know what it was either</a>.
</li><li> <em>Strelka Stories</em>, a game set in the same universe as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailConcerto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailConcerto">Tail Concerto</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo">Solatorobo</a></em>.

</li><li> The Japanese Famicom version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Strider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Strider">Strider</a></em> was promoted as early as mid-1988, during the serialization of the manga (which shared the same basic premise of the NES game). The game was delayed a few times, then was never heard from again. An American-only English version based on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a> did however saw release in July 1989. Several rumored sequels for the series surfaced over the years, but the only one known for sure existed was GRiN's attempted reboot in 2009, which didn't break out of proof-of-concept before the company filed for bankrupcy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunsoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunsoft">Sunsoft</a> had made a game called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sunman">Sunman</a></em> for the original NES that, sadly, never got released. Its gameplay mechanics seem to hint, though, that they had planned to make this as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> game, but Sunsoft couldn't keep the rights to the Man of Steel and had planned to make a game using the engine they had made with original characters. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sunman">Sunman</a></em> by Sunsoft was planned to be released in 1992, but never came out due to unknown reasons.
</li><li> Introversion Software (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uplink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uplink">Uplink</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DEFCON" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DEFCON">DEFCON</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darwinia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darwinia">Darwinia</a></em>) spent many years hinting at their new project, <em>Subversion</em>, and even produced an intriguing twenty-part development blog &mdash; before abruptly halting all announcements and going dark for ten months. A lot of people feared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>, but the reality was more mundane; they'd realised that <em>Subversion</em>'s ideas weren't coalescing into a game in they wanted it to, so they threw it onto the back burner and turned to a new game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonArchitect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonArchitect">Prison Architect</a></em>. <em>Subversion</em> remains as a project and an idea, but it's pretty much on indefinite hiatus as a game.
</li><li> <em>Super Bat Puncher</em>, a critically-acclaimed NES homebrew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">Platform Game</a>. All that was ever released of it was a two-level demo, back in 2011. The developers have since moved on to another project, <em>Micro Mages</em>.
</li><li> <em>Super Dog Booby: Akachan Daib&#333;ken no Maki</em> was meant to released for the Famicom back in 1991 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Jaleco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Jaleco">Jaleco</a>, but it was never released for unknown reasons. Despite its name, it was nothing to do with boobies, instead you played as a dog named Booby who had to guard a baby named Alfred from hazards.
</li><li> Ever heard of the (very NSFW) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmoGame">Emo Game</a></em>? There was a <em>Super Emo Game III</em> in development for a long time. Scheduled for a 2006 release, it... was never released. Very, <em>very</em> occasional updates were released for years. For a while, it was claimed the game was going to be on a CD you could order online. And then, to close the cycle, superemogame.com was taken down and all mention of <em>Super Emo Game III</em> was removed from emogame.com, as were the links to the blogs discussing it. Jason Oda has since considered the Emogame series an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.
</li><li> <em>Superhero</em> was an amazing-looking Amiga game, a mix of beat-em-up and platformer ahead of its time, which was announced in 1994 but never released. It was actually pretty much finished but an incredible case of bad luck, as detailed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.indieretronews.com/2015/08/unreleased-amiga-game-superhero-gets.html">in this article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, prevented it to see the light of the day. Basically, the dev team's computers were confiscated by the police for an investigation, and when they received them back four years later, the Amiga game market was all but dead. To add insult to injury, the salvaged code was lost when the working computers were destroyed in a house fire. Plus, it's unclear who owns the rights to the game so, even if it could be miraculously re-created, it couldn't be legally published again. The main developer would like to work on a similar game someday, but the original is sadly lost forever.
</li><li> <em>Sword of Legendia</em> was first announced in 2006 by Namco Bandai Games and was to be an RPG for the Wii. Though the title sounds similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia">Tales of Legendia</a></em>, produce Tsutomo Gouda said it wasn't actually part of the <em>Tales</em> series and that the name would likely change. Other than <a class="urllink" href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=119634">one piece of character art<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, nothing was revealed about the game for years. No other pieces of art were shown, no screenshots, no trailers, not even any basic information on the story or gameplay. In a 2008 interview with Gouda regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>, he said that <em>Sword of Legendia</em> was still in development. Kentaru Kawashima, producer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FragileDreamsFarewellRuinsOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FragileDreamsFarewellRuinsOfTheMoon">Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon</a></em> also claimed the game was still in development in a 2009 interview. Finally, in a Japan Expo 2011 interview with Yoshizumi Makoto, it was revealed that <em>Sword of Legendia</em> was cancelled years ago.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Swordquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Swordquest">Swordquest</a>: Airworld</em> was cancelled very early due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a>. According to Tod Frye, the game's creative director, the actual game was only about 20% complete, and the comic-book tie in was never even started. All we know about the actual gameplay is that it would've been based on the <em>I Ching</em>, an ancient Chinese text.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa">Tabula Rasa</a></em> was originally developed as a fantasy MMORPG and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em>, by gaming legend Richard "Lord British" Garriott. It spent ten years in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, cost millions, and, according to the hype, was going to do to MMOs what <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> did to RPGs. The original fantasy design was scrapped and reworked into a different fantasy MMORPG, then that version was scrapped and reworked as an MMOFPS that went defunct a year after its release. Garriott sued the publisher, with each claiming the other was responsible for one of the game industry's most spectacular failures to date. It turns out it was NCSoft's fault, through what can only be called a real life example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> behavior &mdash; they cancelled the healthy MMO and forged a resignation letter from Richard Garriott (In Space!) to keep him from getting a stock windfall. This backfired gloriously though, as Garriott successfully sued them for $28 million.
</li><li> One running joke among players of the serial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> <em>A Tale In The Desert</em> comes from the lead developer's insistence that 'This Telling (iteration) will be shorter'. Of course, that was back in the second Telling, which ran for a year and a half, and led to the third Telling, which ran for over two years. Well into the fourth Telling, there were no predictions for how long it would run, though the fact that its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree">Tech Tree</a> quickly pushed forth light years ahead of its predecessors was a good sign...

As of 2014, there has been little news on how far in development <em>Tekken X Street Fighter</em>, apart from comments from series producer Katsuhiro Harada assuring everyone that the game is not canceled. No official gameplay footage has been shown, no roster has been announced, and a release date has yet to be established. In 2019, Harada mentioned that the future of the game is uncertain due to the success of <em>Tekken 7</em>, which realigned Bandai Namco's priorities concerning <em>TxSF</em>.
</li><li> The shutdown of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> left a lot of series unfinished or unreleased, including the final episodes of <em>The Walking Dead: The Final Season</em>, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> Season 2, <em>Game of Thrones</em> Season 2, an untitled <em>Stranger Things</em> game and even an <em>Evil Dead</em> game.

A similar game was shown off in 2015, reusing assets from the 2009 version, but very little has been said about it since.

The game was raked across the coals of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> for years, its publisher &mdash; Virgin Interactive &mdash; trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">tone down the violence</a> in it to conform to an M rating before being picked up by EA. While it's now available through filesharing by the game's developers, there will never be an official release of it; EA found the game so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">senselessly violent</a> that they actually refused to sell the game off to someone else, for fear of it getting out and tarnishing their reputation.

Two words: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect">Future Perfect</a></em> sold very well and was positively received by critics, it took two years for developer Free Radical Design to announce the next <em>TimeSplitters</em> game. Their next project, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Haze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Haze">Haze</a></em>, sold poorly and gave a debilitating financial blow to Free Radical, forcing them to cancel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsBattlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> III</em> right before its completion. Free Radical went into administration before being sold to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Crytek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Crytek">Crytek</a> to become Crytek UK, who proceeded to put <em>TimeSplitters 4</em> on indefinite hiatus so that it could work on Crytek's own <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> series instead. Then, Crytek UK imploded in 2014 due to financial issues caused by expos&eacute;s that revealed Crytek had been paying the studio's employees very little (as in, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.eteknix.com/crytek-uk-employees-on-strike-refuses-going-to-work/">about &pound;700 per month<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), causing them to go on strike. With the series rights currently sitting with THQ Nordic, the future does hold some promise, but no word has surfaced since the acquisition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toons</a>: Defenders of the Universe</em> was being developed by Treasure in the early 2000s under contract from Conspiracy, with screenshots and previews being shown. However, years passed by and there was nothing new on the release of the game. Eventually, the game was confirmed as cancelled, the reason supposedly being that Conspiracy went bankrupt around 2002, and lost the rights to Tiny Toon Adventures before the game was released. Fortunately, the game wasn't completely lost, as a ROM of the beta was leaked, and can be played on a PS2 emulator.
</li><li> Blizzard's unannounced MMO, code named <em>Titan</em>, which was in development since 2006, underwent a "reset" in 2013 and wasn't expected to release until 2016 at the earliest, if at all. In 2014, Blizzard announced that <em>Titan</em> was officially cancelled, as they couldn't figure out a way to make the game fun, and they decided that they didn't need a second MMO. Some of the game's assets and concepts (such as a teleporting character with SMGs) were used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> instead.

Some time later the dev team changed their name to Mental Drink and around 2010 set up a website, a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/FightNJokes/">Facebook page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/WoAdbgbMp8s">YouTube trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to promote the new and improved version of their game that was supposed to come out for Nintendo DS and iPhone. Years later, the ToonFighterZ site shut down and Mental Drink only actually made lame advergames and rehashes of Pong and Space Invaders. It's safe to say that the project's dead at this point.

David Jaffe himself more or less admitted it was false, and it's more likely that Jaffe was too busy working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">God of War</a></em> to be able to devote his full attention to <em>Twisted Metal</em>, so he ultimately pulled the plug on the game because of it. What was available and completed was put into <em>Twisted Metal: Head-On: Extra Twisted Edition</em> for the PS2 under the title "<em>Twisted Metal: Lost</em>" as well as a three-dimensional out-of-vehicle exploration area where you play as Needles Kane, entitled "Sweet Tour" (which was supposedly going to be part of <em>Harbor City</em> as well).
</li><li> <em>Tyrannosaurus Tex</em>, by Slitherine Software, was going to be a single player FPS, with planned two-player deathmatch, on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a>.

Some themes of sci-fi mixed with dark fantasy were later used in the <em>Technocrat War</em> novelization trilogy and the <em>Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge</em> expansion, as Todd McFarlane had already developed concept art for the game, and a short preview was shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em>.

However, don't expect this game to ever be released, as in 2014, CCP officially cancelled the game and disbanded the development team.
<ul><li> Descriptions of the internal practice in CCP indicate that the game was essentially victim to EVE Online's expansion cycle; personnel would be 'temporarily reassigned' to the latest EVE expansion, and replaced with new people later who had no idea where the project stood, thus requiring the development team to start from scratch. Rumor is that they got the game to an alpha build on three separate occasions, each one an entirely different engine. When CCP sold White Wolf and its properties off to Paradox studios, they supposedly got all the code from these alpha builds... but MMOs aren't Paradox's forte, and it's unlikely they'll try to make it work, when they could simply develop games that fit the franchise and their expertise first.

</li><li> <em>Young Justice: Legacy</em> was released for the 3DS, PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, while the DS, Wii and Wii U versions were cancelled.

<ul><li> Vaporware is not a new phenomenon. Way back in the 8-bit days of 1984, <em>Psyclapse</em> and <em>Bandersnatch</em> (for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, respectively, although practically the same game) were in development for Imagine Software. Advertising promised much &mdash; hardware dongles to support new features Never Seen Before on either system, and promoting the achievements of its outrageously large development team (of nine, nearly nine times the average for the time). Despite the hype, it eventually became clear that <em>Psyclapse</em> never got past the design stage, and <em>Bandersnatch</em> would need to sell for a ridiculous amount of money just to break even. By the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">the BBC</a> arrived to film the spectacular successes of a Liverpool-based firm at the forefront of the then-upstart computer games industry, Imagine were absolutely in the toilet, and the BBC found themselves making <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/ZoDh61sgCOg">a cautionary tale about corporate excess<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that finished with the bailiffs arriving to repossess everything Imagine ever owned (and very nearly the BBC cameras, too). One of the splinter companies organized in the wake of Imagine's demise, Finchspeed, continued to develop <em>Bandersnatch</em>, and a version for the Sinclair QL was allegedly completed but never released. Finally, the game was remade as <em>Brataccas</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariST">Atari ST</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> and published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Psygnosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Psygnosis">Psygnosis</a>, a new company that would also revive Psyclapse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> as a secondary publishing label. (Ocean Software likewise acquired the corporate name and associated trademarks of Imagine and assigned them to a development unit of its own.) <em>Bandersnatch</em> even inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackMirrorBandersnatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackMirrorBandersnatch">an interactive movie about struggling to develop a game</a>.
<ul><li> Another notorious ZX Spectrum example was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StreetHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StreetHawk">Street Hawk</a></em>, a spin-off from a barely noticed American action TV show that suffered such severe delays that the software company had to give a completely different game with the same title to a magazine that they'd promised copies to for a subscription gift offer.
</li><li> <em>Scooby-Doo in the Castle Mystery</em> was originally previewed in magazines as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair">Dragon's Lair</a></em>-like game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>. The publisher ultimately decided the original concept was technically unworkable, and so commissioned a simpler game using the same license. This inspired <em>Crash Magazine</em>'s "Scooby Award" for much-delayed games.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SigueSigueSputnik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SigueSigueSputnik">Sigue Sigue Sputnik</a>'s "Massive Retaliation" ends with an ad for an unreleased game: "Behold, the fifth generation of home computer entertainment. Get the Sigue Sigue Sputnik computer game from your favorite software house now." The game was mentioned in <em>Computer and Video Games</em> issue 60 and <em>Commodore User</em> issue 35, promising a September 1986 release date on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a>, with plans for release on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC">Amstrad CPC</a>. Tony Gibson and Mark Harrison created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a> demo, labelled "Media Wars", in hopes of finding a publisher, but the original disks were lost after being left at a friend's house, who threw them out after a flood.
</li><li> The officially licensed <em>Star Trek</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> (not to be confused with its various ports of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekTextGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekTextGame">Star Trek Text Game</a>) became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in magazines like <em>Sinclair User</em> for its persistent failure to be released. It never did make it to the Spectrum, though as <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-trek-the-rebel-universe">Star Trek: The Rebel Universe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> it did show up on the Commodore 64, Atari ST and PC.
</li></ul></li><li> In late 1982, The Great Game Company (which would later become GameTek) announced plans to adapt seven game shows into video games for the Atari 2600: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild">The Joker's Wild</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password Plus</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>. Unfortunately, they were being developed just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a> started and the plans were put to an abrupt end. Of the seven games, only <em>Feud</em> got far enough for a prototype which is presumed to be lost.
</li><li> Over the years, there have been a major number of Anime-related games that attempted to cross over to the US, but failed.
<ul><li> There were plans to release games based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em> and it was advertised in the 1990s release of the anime. It would have been for all systems and each one would have gone a different route (Genesis would have been multi-genre, the Super NES would have just been sidescrolling, Game Boy would have been just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">Dolled-Up Installment</a>), but THQ bought the company making it, Black Pearl, and killed it.
</li><li> There were two attempts to make a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KimbaTheWhiteLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KimbaTheWhiteLion">Kimba the White Lion</a></em> game, one for the NES and another for the Nintendo 64. Both were oddly cancelled.
</li><li> <em>Macross VF-X2</em>: The cancelled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> North American localization was to include English voice acting and an exclusive mecha.
</li><li> There was supposed to have been a game based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> by Sega. Not much was said about it beyond a simple ad.
</li><li> Tecmo created an MMORPG based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bastard">Bastard!!</a></em>. It got as far as the beta stage before it got cancelled.
</li><li> Toho planned to release the fighting game <em>Ranma &frac12; II: Anything Goes Martial Arts</em> for the SNES, the cancelled localization of <em>Ranma &frac12;: Chougi Rambuhen</em>.
</li><li> In 2005, Bandai planned to release <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>: Serenade of Remembrance</em> to the States after releasing it in Japan. In 2006, everything was dropped about it and a Bandai rep admitted it thought it would be a waste of time. Fun fact: the image on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">Cowboy BeBop at His Computer</a> trope page came from that game.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BullfrogProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BullfrogProductions">Bullfrog Productions</a> was working on several games that were cancelled due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> buying them up: <em>Creation</em>, <em>Dungeon Keeper 3: War for the Overworld</em>, <em>Genesis: The Hand of God</em>, <em>The Indestructibles</em>, <em>Theme Movie Studio</em>, <em>Theme Resort</em>, and <em>Void Star</em>.
</li><li> Some games based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a> were advertised but not released. A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13">Gen13</a></em> game was announced for PlayStation, N64 and Saturn. A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shadowhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shadowhawk">Shadowhawk</a></em> game on the SNES was not released, though prototypes have been found. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood">Youngblood: Search And Destroy</a></em> was announced for PlayStation and PC, and was not released, though the PC version's demo is available.
</li><li> A third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastBlade">The Last Blade</a></em> game and a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Garou: Mark of the Wolves</a></em> were apparently in development when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK">SNK</a> collapsed in 2001.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lufia">Lufia</a></em> series has a few of these:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom">Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</a></em>, which was advertised with a delay ("It's worth the wait!"), but never released. The same company assigned to develop this port was <a class="urllink" href="http://opa-ages.com/forums/topic/74650-prototype-of-a-playstation-game-i-worked-on-in-1994/">also working on<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> two other never-release games for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Taito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Taito">Taito</a>: <em>Brimstone</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> and <em>Farstar</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>.
</li><li> <em>Lufia: Ruins Chaser</em> for the Sony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, cancelled due to the bankruptcy of its developer. (Ideas from that game were used in <em>Lufia: The Legend Returns</em>, which was developed by the same developer, Neverland, as the first two games in the series and the second's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">reimagining</a>.)
</li><li> <em>Lufia: Beginning of a Legend</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a>, originally in development alongside <em>Ruins Chaser</em>. (Unlike Ruins Chaser, the ideas used in this game were scrapped entirely rather than handed to Neverland.)
</li></ul></li><li> The equivalents of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemForever">Duke Nukem Forever</a></em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modding</a> community are <em>Mordeth</em> Episode 2 and <em>Millennium</em>. <em>Mordeth</em> in particular is so notorious for this that the Cacowards' "longest development time" award is named the "Mordeth Award" in its honor.
</li><li> Several Maxis games were unreleased.
<ul><li> <em>SimCity</em> on the SNES started developed as a <em>SimCity</em> game on the NES, which was not released.
</li><li> Though <em>SimCity 3000</em> was released in 1999 as a 2D followup to <em>SimCity 2000</em>, the game was previewed as a full 3D game. This version was not released.
</li><li> <em>SimMars</em>, planned to be released around 2000, was previewed on the CD for <em>SimCity 3000</em>; the game was canceled, though <em>The Sims: Vacation</em> references a <em>SimMars</em> arcade game.
</li><li> <em>SimsVille</em>, planned to be released around 2001, was previewed on the CD for <em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited</em> and <em>The Sims: Livin' Large</em>, and was canceled, with some features included in <em>The Sims: Hot Date</em>, <em>The Sims 2</em>, <em>The Sims 3</em>, <em>MySims</em>, and <em>SimCity 4</em>.
</li><li> <em>MySims Social</em> was going to be a Facebook social game, like the defunct <em>The Sims Social</em> and <em>SimCity Social</em> games, and was canceled.
</li><li> The <em>Sims</em> console game, <em>The Urbz: Sims in the City</em>, was planned to be a series of around three games, with an eventual PC port. <em>The Urbz 2</em>, planned for release on PlayStation 2, Gamecube and Xbox, had its development moved to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii, and was canceled. The PlayStation 2 version of <em>The Sims 2</em> uses <em>The Urbz 2</em> engine, and assets can be found on the game disc.
</li><li> Most elusive and controversial of all was of course <em>SimRefinery</em>, which was being produced in collaboration with Chevron. An early alpha of the game was finally found and leaked into the internet in early 2020.
</li></ul></li><li> PC games that use mods will often fall under this trope at some point. Usually, the modder or a team of modders will get a bit too ambitious in their work and give up trying to complete the mod or real life issues pop up that prevent them from finishing their work. It is not unheard of to see mods with great potential that won't ever see the light of day.
</li><li> Not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaker">Game Makers</a> are safe! In the MegaZeux community, the general rule is that if someone publishes a demo of their game, that game will never be released. Period. This trend is popularly known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.digitalmzx.net/wiki/index.php?title=Demo_curse">demo curse<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and came about due to the scope of any given MegaZeux game growing too big for its designer(s) to handle when the engine was new compared to a smaller game made in its more limited spiritual predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZZT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZZT">ZZT</a></em>. Among its best-known victims are <em>A Death Beyond Imagination</em>, <em>Honor Quest 2</em>, and <em>Weirdness</em> (by the creator of MegaZeux herself, who released only the first chapter before leaving the community.)
<ul><li> The most infamous of them all, however, is most likely the MegaZeux port of the ZZT game <em><a class="urllink" href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/s/sivion.zip">Sivion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, which was hyped to the point that its author included digs at ZZT's obsolescence compared to MegaZeux <em>in the ZZT version</em>, and created a (mostly) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=1299">non-interactive slide show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with breathless narration about how the MegaZeux version would be so much bigger and more exciting than the ZZT version. In the end, all that came out of this enthusiasm was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=1712">a demo with barely anything in it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=465">an unfinished prototype<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> More notable cases include Autumn Dreams' <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=101">Xenogenesis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> and Draconic Creations' <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=190">The Dark Corner<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, both of which are compilations of demos for the companies' games, with the former including another demo of the aforementioned <em>Sivion</em> remake. With a scant few exceptions (including <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=681">Darkness II<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=272">Honor Quest: Special Edition<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> and <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalmzx.com/show.php?id=1">Bernard the Bard<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>), none of these games were ever completed, marking them as <em>en masse</em> cases of the demo curse.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nintendo 64's path through history was littered by the emaciated bodies of partially developed games. Some, like <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robotech">Robotech</a>: Crystal Dreams</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a> 64</em> (<a class="urllink" href="http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_Ankoku_no_Miko">also known<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as <em>Ankoku no Miko</em> aka <em>Maiden of Darkness</em>), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">64 Wars</a></em> and the above <em>Earthbound 64</em>, simply collapsed under their own weight and died. Others, like efforts toward a 3D <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> game and sequel to <em>Mario 64</em>, produced various side-projects in lieu of their originally intended design. In fact, the N64 was <em>legendary</em> for this sort of thing, with games supposed to be launch titles stuck in development for years afterwards (<em>Body Harvest</em>, <em>Mission: Impossible</em>) and swapping between multiple development teams, executive meddling, and ultimately numerous cancellations. None of this helped the flagging fortunes of the system as gamers frustrated by the long software droughts often abandoned Nintendo for the more reliable PlayStation lineup. Remember <em>Freak Boy</em>? No? Didn't think so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ObsidianEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ObsidianEntertainment">Obsidian Entertainment</a></em> had announced several projects being developed concurrently which were not published, including a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em> known as <em>Dwarves</em>, <em>Futureblight</em>, and the Xbox One third person open world RPG <em>Stormlands</em>, known as project <em>North Carolina</em>. <em>Aliens: Crucible</em> was going to be an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienS">Aliens</a></em> RPG, but SEGA chose to publish <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines">Aliens: Colonial Marines</a></em> instead.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon">Panel de Pon</a></em> remake/sequel is a really odd case. The Japanese release of the game was canned, but the game did make it into worldwide markets as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">Dolled-Up Installment</a> featuring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> characters. Japan (and regrettably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">only Japan</a>) would get what the game was originally intended to be one generation later in <em>Nintendo Puzzle Collection</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rare</a> picked up quite a few of these, specially in the hey day of the N64 and GameCube era.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em> never received a port for the Nintendo 64, despite being advertised in the arcade machine's attract mode. The SNES port of <em>Killer Instinct 2</em> was never released. <em>Killer Instinct 3</em> was planned for the arcade and N64, but was canceled to focus on developing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwelveTalesConker64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwelveTalesConker64">Twelve Tales: Conker 64</a></em>, the game that became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em>.
</li><li> Conker would <em>once again</em> have trouble with this as a sequel for the GameCube was announced, but cancelled.
</li><li> <em>Donkey Kong Racing</em>, a racing game slated for the GameCube that would focus around the entire Kong family, and would have you riding on animals instead of vehicles. It was canned once Rareware was bought out by MS.
</li><li> Due to the cancellation of the "McLaren" Windows Phone, featuring gesture technology, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> style mobile game, <em>TJ Combo Boxing</em>, was canceled, along with the games <em>Fragments</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Young Conker</a></em>.
</li><li> And before they were Rare, they were Ultimate Play The Game on the ZX Spectrum; the endings of <em>Knight Lore</em>, <em>Pentagram</em> and <em>Underwurlde</em> all hinted at the imminent release of <em>Mire Mare</em>... rumours abound, but the most widely accepted theory is that it was at most half finished and subsequently abandoned when Ultimate were partially taken over by US Gold.
</li></ul></li><li> Three games based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> were announced by Parker Bros. for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a>, but they only released one, <em>Death Star Battle</em>, before abandoning video games due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a>. A prototype of "Game I" (also known as <em>Ewok Adventure</em>) was discovered, but the second game, whose concept art suggests being based on the Battle of Sarlacc's Pit, appears to have never been programmed. Other unreleased titles announced by Parker Bros. included <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a>: Journey to Rivendell</em>, <em>McDonald's</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>, and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> game based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraintopBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraintopBattle">Traintop Battle</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy">Octopussy</a></em>; prototypes of the first two have emerged.
</li><li> Freeware developer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Seiklus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Seiklus">tapeworm</a> has been working on <em>Velella</em> for nearly five years, and <em>Avaus</em> for three. On his site, he mentioned he wants to have <em>Avaus</em> done by the end of 2007, then struck it through and appended 2008. Both years, of course, have long since passed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a>:
<ul><li> Plans to continue with VGA remakes of previous titles, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King's Quest</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIRomancingTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIRomancingTheThrone">II</a></em> &amp; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIIToHeirIsHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestIIIToHeirIsHuman">III</a></em>, were cancelled when sales of their released VGA remakes did not meet expectations.
</li><li> A proposed version of <em>Mask of Eternity</em> by Davidson and Associates was going to be a more non-violent version of the game.
</li><li> When <em>Mask of Eternity</em> was being developed, Roberta Williams discussed concepts for <em>King's Quest IX</em>, including being a multiplayer or MMO adventure; the project was not further developed. Ideas included Connor starring in the series; King Graham would be older and unable to go on further adventures, and Alexander would be busy as king of the Green Isles. Connor would meet Rosella, forming an eventual love triangle between Connor, Rosella and Edgar. In-game, Connor and Rosella could swap items, helping each other in solving puzzles and fighting monsters together.
</li><li> Along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarryMagnaCumLaude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarryMagnaCumLaude">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</a></em>, Vivendi Games planned to release more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> console action titles. <em>King's Quest</em> would be a console action game with King Graham wielding a huge sword, wearing armor, and doing flips. <em>Space Quest</em> by Escape Factory was to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox">Xbox</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PS2</a> action platformer.
</li><li> Another <em>King's Quest</em> was being developed by Silicon Knights on the Unreal Engine.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> was going to release an episodic <em>King's Quest</em> series.
</li><li> <em>Space Quest 7</em> was planned to be 3D with a multiplayer mode. The project was put on hold, restarted, then cancelled.
</li><li> Cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry">Leisure Suit Larry</a></em> games include the 3D <em>Leisure Suit Larry 8: Lust in Space</em>, <em>Leisure Suit Larry: Pocket Party</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NGage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NGage">N-Gage</a> by TKO-Software, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarryMagnaCumLaude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarryMagnaCumLaude">Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude</a></em> sequel <em>Leisure Suit Larry: Cocoa Butter</em> for PC, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PS2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox">Xbox</a>.
</li><li> Al Lowe had plans to remake the rest of the Sierra-era Larry games had the first remake sold well. Sadly, it didn't, which lead to Lowe parting ways with the publisher instead, leaving the rest of the planned remakes in the air.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TorinsPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TorinsPassage">Torin's Passage</a></em> was to be a <em>series</em>, on the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a>'s adventure "____ Quest" series. Knowing this, some of the stuff you see in the game makes a <em>lot</em> more sense.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Ultima IV: Part II</em> would have been a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIV">Ultima IV</a></em> (1986).
</li><li> <em>Multi-player Ultima</em> would have been an eight-to-sixteen-player multiplayer strategy game released in 1986-1987. The concept of a multiplayer Ultima game was later revisited in <em>Multima</em>, a multiplayer game using the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em> engine, but that was canceled too.
</li><li> <em>Mythos</em> was to be a precursor to <em>Worlds of Ultima</em> using the <em>Ultima VI</em> engine. It would have featured Caribbean pirates and a Greek-inspired setting and was set to be released around 1990.
</li><li> <em>Arthurian Legends</em> would have been either the third game in the <em>Worlds of Ultima</em> series, or a standalone game. It would have used the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em> engine and, as the name implied, it would be set in a Camelot-type setting.
</li><li> <em>Ultima Underworld III</em> would have featured a new world and protagonist, and would have been released sometime around 1993-1995.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a></em> was released with quests and scripts cut and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> content. The cat island, Claw, was supposed to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Kilrathi</a> pilot crash land on the island and be worshipped as a cat god.
</li><li> <em>Ultima VIII: The Lost Vale</em> was a cancelled expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII">Ultima VIII</a></em> that would address the Zealan sub-plot, and what was behind the double doors in the Plateau.
</li><li> <em>Ultima Online 2</em> would have been a 3D "2nd generation MMORPG" to compete with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em>. Its name was changed to <em>Ultima Worlds Online: Origin</em>. It would have been released sometime around 2000-2001.
</li><li> <em>Ultima X: Odyssey</em> would have been an MMORPG set on the world of Alucinor, continuing where <em>Ultima IX</em> left off. It would have had more cartoonish graphics and a virtue system.
</li><li> <em>Ultima Resurrection</em> would have been a hack n' slash game for the PSP released around 2005-2006.
</li></ul></li><li> Valve has a habit of this. What makes them notorious for their extremely long delays is their demand for perfection in their games, as they stated in the commentary for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>. Basically, unless they are happy with how the game is coming out, they will not release it <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ro5w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10ro5w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ro5w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And that's <em>if</em> they're working on it. Since Valve seems to have nebulous working habits where programmers can switch jobs, it's likely they won't be working on any old games, like say <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">L4D2</a></em>,when something new comes along leaving a skeleton crew to keep the game(s) running (but growing increasingly stale) while more popular games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em> or new programs such as the Vive get all of the love.</span>:
<ul><li> <em>Half-Life Gold</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em> with the High-Definition Pack and <em>Blue Shift</em> expansion) was set to come out on the Dreamcast. It was even featured on the cover of GamePro and had a strategy guide to Blue Shift. But due to an announcement by Sega that they would be ending production and support of the Dreamcast, the game was never commercially released. The game was eventually leaked onto the Internet, and outside of having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">Loads and Loads of Loading</a>, it appears to be otherwise complete.
</li><li> <em>Half-Life 2: Episode Three</em> or possibly by now, <em>Half-Life 3</em>: Originally with a release date of Christmas 2007, there's been no trace of it since then. Valve outright refuses to say anything about the game and hardly acknowledges the series exists at all, even going so far as to ignore the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">20th anniversary</a> of the series in November 2018. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/half-life-3-release-date-story-gameplay-art">Leaks have confirmed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the game has entered development, been cancelled, and started over several times, with many Valve employees being so exhausted by the development cycle that they no longer want to work on it. It doesn't help that in March 2015, founder Gabe Newell has more or less confirmed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/18/8253189/gabe-newell-valve-half-life">none of Valve's senior staff actually want to devote the company's efforts and time to focused single-player game development<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. And with the news of Half-Life chief writer Marc Laidlaw's retirement from the company at the start of 2016 as well as co-writer Chet Faliszek's resignation in mid-2017, it was believed that the game had been quietly shelved altogether in favor of Steam and hardware development. However, the 2020 release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeAlyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeAlyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a></em> <em>finally</em> confirmed some sort of follow-up to Episode 2's ending, revitalizing the community's hope for the end of the trilogy.
</li><li> Valve promised that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> would receive frequent updates like <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. After seeing all the problems in the gameplay that <em>Left 4 Dead</em> had and what needed to be fixed, Valve most likely would have to change and patch so many things that they believed it would be better to release a sequel that addresses all the issues. Fans naturally reminded Valve daily about the promise that was broken.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualBoy">Virtual Boy</a> games.

</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES">Older Than the NES</a>: the numerous never-released games for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Colecovision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Colecovision">Colecovision</a> are pretty close. Some games, like <em>Chess Challenger</em> and <em>Mr. Turtle</em>, were advertised on the system's box, but never saw release, most likely due to the end of the system's production run in 1984.
</li><li> The developer Zoonami is infamous for this. The studio was founded in 2000, and hyped up to be a major third-party publisher for Nintendo, but its two major projects (a FPS for the GameCube called <em>Game Zero</em> and the rhythm game <em>Funkydilla</em>) were announced but never released.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon">Zoo Tycoon</a> 2</em> user-made extension pack "Cretaceous Calamity" was announced years ago and still has no release date. Both that particular UXP and the others by the same group (Mysterious Map Marvels) have a history of trouble and delays.
<ul><li> There have been hundreds of UXPs announced for Zoo Tycoon 2, but only roughly five or six UXPs ever released.
</li></ul></li><li> Golgoth Studio was a French developer founded in 2008 that started with pretty ambitious projects: HD <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remakes</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoeAndMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoeAndMac">Joe &amp; Mac</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Toki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Toki">Toki</a></em>, both supposed to come out in 2010. Every mention of <em>Joe and Mac</em> was quickly removed from their site after nothing more than a couple of character designs was shown, and the Toki remake suffered the same fate: after about five years of promises, they just pulled the plug and removed their whole website. The only game they ever released was the mediocre <em>Magical Drop V</em> for Windows.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OceanSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OceanSoftware">Ocean Software</a> had a French subsidiary that specialized in porting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Games</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariST">Atari ST</a>.

At least the Amiga versions of the latter two were completed, yet Ocean, apparently due to licensing problems, decided to cancel all of them and close Ocean France. The Amiga versions of <em>Liquid Kids</em> and <em>Snow Bros</em> were unearthed and leaked onto the Internet many years later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Psygnosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Psygnosis">Psygnosis</a>, somewhere in between the Sony buyout and the launch of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, canceled most of their upcoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Mega Drive</a> games.
<ul><li> The developers of <em>Res-Q</em> soon leaked copies of their otherwise unreleased game. A prototype of <em>Bill's Tomato Game</em>, ported from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> by the same team, was later recovered.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Whizz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Whizz">Whizz</a></em> ended up being released on the Amiga by Flair after Psygnosis dropped it, followed by multiple console ports, but not the Mega Drive version, which was supposedly the original.
</li><li> Another Mega Drive game Psygnosis chose not to release was Digital Illusions' all-but-finished <em>Hardcore</em>, whose Amiga version was also canceled.
</li></ul></li><li> Before focusing entirely on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, developer Retro Studios was working on four GameCube titles: <em>NFL Retro Football</em>, <em>Car Combat</em> or <em>Thunder Rally</em>, <em>Raven Blade</em>, and the tentatively titled <em>Action-Adventure</em>. The engine behind <em>Action-Adventure</em> would be re-used for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>.
</li><li> More than half of the games announced by Scavenger, Inc. were never published, no thanks to a shoddy distribution deal with GT Interactive that helped push the company into bankruptcy. Their unreleased games include <em>4x4 Frenzy</em>, <em>Heavy Machinery</em>, <em>Into the Shadows</em>, <em>Mudkicker</em> and <em>Tarantula</em>.
</li><li> The abrupt closure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> put all of their games in development at the time into development limbo, including the second seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs">The Wolf Among Us</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelltalesGameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelltalesGameOfThrones">Telltale's Game of Thrones</a></em>, as well as a game based off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em>.
</li><li> Since the advent of online naval combat games involving depictions and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personifications</a> of real-life naval vessels from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">World War One</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>, there has been one specific ship that has been continually teased across multiple games, but has not (so far) graced the limelight as of late: the Aircraft Carrier <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Shinano">Shinano<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, at least to the following games:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KantaiCollection">Kantai Collection</a></em> was the earliest of the naval battle-themed games to tease the inclusion of her shipgirl form in its growing roster, with its primary developer Kadokawa having already released Alpha Art of her in supplementary materials <em><a class="urllink" href="http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2312428">way back in 2013<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>. Unfortunately, she has yet to make her appearance as of early 2020. Coupled with the successive debut of foreign Navies (currently at Seven, the latest being both the Australian Navy and the Dutch Navy via the 2019 Fall Event), and the introduction of more unique ship variants like the coastal defense ships and escort carriers, for starters, the wait is expected to become longer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em>, meanwhile, had intended to introduce the virtual form of the actual ship (probably as how she was supposed to look like completed), but had to forego her in favor of the current Tier-X Hakuryu from the Closed Beta Testing onward. Problems with Shinano's Alpha form arose from the fact that she was a CV carrying the same tanky <em>Yamato-class</em> hull, which meant that a lot of ships had trouble taking her down in the process.
</li><li> KanColle's current main competitor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzurLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzurLane">Azur Lane</a></em> had teased Shinano's inclusion in the game, thanks to data mining done by fans, AND have made her an important, albeit off-screen character in the Swirling Cherry Blossom event. So far, there has been no word of her official introduction as a playable shipgirl.

<ul><li> Development of the largely anticipated and long-awaited fan project <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic">My Little Pony: Fighting Is Magic</a></em> was terminated by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">cease and desist order from Hasbro</a>. A massive backlash immediately ensued, and in doing so increased rumors that Hasbro is attempting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">to take more control of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">the show</a>. After about two and a half years after the original project was given the Cease and Desist, Mane 6, the developers of <em>Fighting Is Magic</em> have since formed their own company and created a new fighting game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds">Them's Fightin' Herds</a></em>, with characters created by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> herself</em>.
</li><li> <em>Sonic 2 HD</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake">Fan Remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em>, had potential when the alpha stages of the remake were shown to the public with brand new shiny HD graphics and remixed music, and quickly became very popular. However, after months of releasing no further information of the game after the Emerald Hill Zone release, the development team decided to come out and say that L0ST, the main programmer of the game, had refused to stay in contact with the team, put DRM in the demo to stop people from trying to look at the game's code (which is actually based off of Sonic 2's) and spent ages trying to make the game suit his vision perfectly, even going so far as to replace other members' work if he wasn't pleased with it. Eventually, the team got sick of his antics and cancelled the project. It's back on a new engine, with concept for more levels released.
</li><li> An unofficial continuation/recreation of <em>Sonic X-treme</em> known as <em>Project-S</em> (which was supervisied by one of <em>Sonic Xtreme</em>s original staff members Chris Senn) began production in 2006, only for the fangame to cease production four years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">much like its (spritual) predecessor</a>.
</li><li> <em>Spyro: Myths Awaken</em> was a fan-game made to act as an unofficial <em>Spyro 4</em>, done in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">retraux</a> style just like the original trilogy. It was hit with a cease-and-desist. The team reworked it as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeraMythsAwaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeraMythsAwaken">Zera: Myths Awaken</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Crash Bandicoot: Crystal's Wrath</em> is a <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> fan-game that has been overhauled several times over the span of 4+ years. It was originally a <em>Twinsanity</em>-style open world platformer but has since changed into a 2D.5 sidescroller.
</li><li> <em>Chrono Trigger Resurrection</em> (later renamed <em>Chrono Resurrection</em>) was a fully-3D remake of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. It became vaporware after being given a cease-and-desist by Square-Enix. Only a demo portion of the start of the game was ever released.
</li><li> ZethN64's <em>Ura Zelda</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> never came out. It was supposed to add back in several cut elements from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>, such the Fairy Fountain and Sky Temple. Over time, it developed into an overly ambitious custom story with concepts that the Nintendo 64 couldn't even handle. The project ended up being cancelled after a few years of development.

<ul><li> The Aladdin Deck Enhancer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">NES</a> accessory was announced with several games that went unreleased, including <em>Bee 52</em>, <em>Big Nose The Caveman</em>, <em>CJ's Elephant Antics</em>, <em>Dreamworld Pogie</em>, <em>F16 Renegade</em>, <em>Go! Dizzy Go!</em>, <em>Metal Man</em>, <em>Mig 29 Soviet Fighter</em>, <em>Stunt Kids</em>, <em>Team Sports Basketball</em>, and <em>The Ultimate Stuntman</em>, though some games ended up released on regular cartridges.
</li><li> The Phantom game console has earned numerous vaporware awards and frequent comments on its auspicious name (as if the entire thing was a practical joke on a massive scale). First announced in 2002 (when its download-only sales model seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">downright insane</a>), it was repeatedly delayed and pushed back until being put on infinite hold in 2006. The design company has since been accused of fraud by the SEC, changed names, and decided to focus on releasing the console's couch-keyboard-and-mouse accessory for other platforms.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indrema">Indrema L600<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by Indrema Entertainment Systems, an ambitious attempt at a "Linux console" with a completely open development platform and hardware based on PC components, including a built-in DVD player; seriously game-changing specs for 1999. A working prototype was exhibited in early 2000, but the designers couldn't raise the capital needed to mass-produce it and it was overtaken by events when the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released shortly afterwards.
</li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari">Atari</a> projects went unreleased:
<ul><li> The Atari Mindlink was going to be a controller for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a>, designed to be worn by the player while reading forehead movements with infrared sensors, to be able to play the games <em>Bionic Breakthrough</em>, <em>Mind Maze</em> and <em>Telepathy</em>. The peripheral was shown at CES, and after complaints of forehead pain, the peripheral was never released to the public.
</li><li> Atari had plans to release Atari 2500 and Atari 2700 consoles.
</li><li> Atari planned to follow up on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari7800" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari7800">Atari 7800</a> with the Atari Panther console.
</li><li> Atari planned to release a handheld system, the Atari Cosmos.
</li><li> Atari planned to follow up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> with the Atari Jaguar II.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> was planned to have a model combining the CD attachment with the console. This may never have gone further than mock-ups, with the Jaguar's CD add-on selling poorly and Atari Corp. approaching bankruptcy at the time.
</li></ul></li><li> During the era of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> were going to partner up and develop a console add-on for the system. On the day of Nintendo's stockholders meeting, Nintendo went through the proposed contract that Sony wrote up and discovered something shocking; if Nintendo agreed to Sony's contract, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint">Sony would have full rights to all of Nintendo's intellectual properties, allowing them to create games based on Nintendo's franchises without Nintendo's permission</a>. The discovery convinced Nintendo to tear up the contract and make a surprise announcement that they would be partnering with Phillips to create a different CD-based console, which itself was also scrapped.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11m6qw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11m6qw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11m6qw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilipsCDi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilipsCDi">Philips CD-i</a> resulted from that second partnership, the contract of which gave Phillips the right to make its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames">own</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotelMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotelMario">games</a> featuring Nintendo's characters.</span> The last-second snub led Sony to create the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> years later. Who knows how things would have been if Nintendo stuck to partnering with Sony.
<ul><li> The oft-forgotten step between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SNESCDROM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SNESCDROM">SNES CD-ROM</a> and the PlayStation involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a>. Sega of America were in serious discussions with Sony to make a new Sega console using CD-ROMs, but Sega of Japan nixed the deal, in part due to acrimony between SoA and SoJ over SoA's greater success in marketing consoles and games.
</li></ul></li><li> A little before launching the Saturn, Sega was planning a system called the "Neptune" which would've played both Genesis and 32X games. This was scrapped, most likely out of fear that it would interfere with the Saturn's momentum. That system's surprise launch in May 1995 (a mere <em>six months</em> after the 32X launched) probably didn't help.
</li><li> Before there was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>, Sega was going to release its own handheld system with touchscreen... <em>back in the mid-90s</em>, as the successor to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>. Needless to say, the idea was way too ahead of its time, as development costs forced Sega to abandon its plans.
</li><li> Microsoft had considered creating a portable gaming device to compete with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a>, with the working title of "Xboy". Despite the idea constantly coming up, it was ultimately shelved due to them being unable to focus on developing both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> and a potential handheld system.
</li><li> The "McLaren" Windows Phone was going to support over thirty games specifically in development for the system, including games based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em>.
</li><li> Sega had also intended to release a VR headset for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UN_pN9ZU8Y">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, making it the first console to get VR, two decades before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a>. The product even almost made it to production. Unfortunately, for this one, it was Sega's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">lawyers</a> that proposed the cancellation in the last minute: The Genesis wasn't fast enough to handle VR without lagging and was causing motion sickness in the beta participants. One wonders if this would still be the case if the product was released <em>after</em> the 32X which was released the next year.
</li><li> In one E3 showing, Nintendo showed off the Vitality Sensor for the Wii, which would have attached onto a person's finger to detect their heartbeat and games would be designed around it. The idea was quietly scrapped due to the technical limitations.
</li><li> The ApeXtreme by Apex Digital was a CD and DVD based console planned for 2004 that went unreleased.
</li><li> Hasbro's Control Vision was a console that used VHS tapes. It became vaporware at the last minute. Just two months before its launch in 1988, the VRAM chip needed for the console had its price raised from $30 per chip to $80. This would mean the Control Vision would need to be priced at $300. Hasbro decided to cancel the console because it couldn't compete against the much cheaper Nintendo Entertainment System (which sold at only $100). Two games from the console, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SewerShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SewerShark">Sewer Shark</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap">Night Trap</a></em>, stood in limbo until they were released for the Sega CD in 1992.
</li><li> Panasonic planned to release a portable game console called Jungle.
</li><li> Via planned to release the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoMA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoMA">Mo MA</a> Eve handheld game console.
</li><li> Ericsson planned to release the Red Jade handheld console.
</li><li> The highly publishized "Sega VR" helmet was an ultimately unreleased add-on to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> meant to act as a virtual reality machine. Before release, it was pushed back to December 1993, before being delayed to late 1994, and subsequently cancelled. The reason given for its cancellation was that it was too dangerous: people could walk around while playing and accidentally injure themselves. The <em>actual</em> reason was that test results said prolonged usage made people dizzy and gave them headaches. It was especially dangerous to children, who would almost always get motion sickness and headaches.
</li><li> The GamePark XGP or XGP Extreme Game Player was going to be a portable video game system.
</li><li> The Ultravision Video Arcade System was going to be a combination game console and 10 inch color TV.
</li><li> Many of the designs invented by Active Enterprises were doomed to fail from the start, but the most ambitious of these was their planned portable gaming console, the <strong>Action Gamemaster</strong>: Conceived as a massive, foot-and-a-half wide beast with a 3.2 inch screen, this system would not only be compatible with proprietary game discs (including "killer app" Cheetahmen 3), but it would also house an expansion port that would accommodate cartridges for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendo">Super Nintendo</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a>, and it could also be used as a portable television set, with a projected price point of <em><strong>500 dollars</strong></em>. It seems as though Active were <em>truly ahead of their time</em> with their idea for a multisystem portable &mdash; many of the Gamemaster's features now seem to have manifested in Sony's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a> instead. Or in Nvidia's case, the Shield Portable, which had a similar controller-with-screen form factor, sans the 18-inch device footprint.

<ul><li> The console was not released aside from some prototypes, and its technology was integrated into FZ-21S and FZ-35S multimedia players, ATM machines, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and coffee machines</a>.

<ul><li> The incident repeated with the Sega Pluto, a low-cost version of the Saturn meant to attempt to help salvage the Saturn's market share and reputation in the US. Ultimately cancelled because, well, Bernie Stolar was still head honcho of Sega of America and he hated the Saturn, period. Additionally, work on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamCast">Sega Dream Cast</a> progressed in parallel and had moved far along enough to be released as a product.
</li></ul></li><li> As buyers were shifting from consoles to computers during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Colecovision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Colecovision">Colecovision</a> promised an expansion module that would essentially turn their console into an Adam computer in an attempt to draw in customers. It never went past the prototype stage.
</li><li> The <em>Wii Vitality Sensor</em> was shown at E3 2009, but was barely discussed since then. Some video game journalists started doubting that the project was ever real and the sensor itself was just a mock up shown because Nintendo didn't have anything new or interesting to reveal at E3 that year. In 2013, the Vitality Sensor was finally brought up by Nintendo... to reveal it was cancelled. It was a real, planned product, but was scrapped because there was too large a portion of test users that the sensor could not read. Oddly, its trademark was renewed in December of 2014.
</li><li> In 2014 Nintendo announced an as-yet still mysterious "quality of life" platform that will be focused on health and fitness and incorporate technology that can detect the user's body in some way. It's been speculated that the vitality sensor project may have morphed into this over time.
</li><li> The Konix Multisystem was a British console developed in the late 80s. Originally created as an advanced peripheral, Konix decided to go further with the project to create a 16-bit computer to compete with the Amiga. The system was then pushed back several times, up to Fall of 1990 due to a very troubled production and employees not receiving their wages. When Konix bankrupted without a finished computer, the project was scrapped.
</li><li> In 2001, Mad Catz planned to release the Bioforce controller, a Playstation 2 controller that sent shock waves to the player. It was shown off at trade shows but never made it to release (likely due to health worries).
</li><li> The Retro Video Game System and its successor the Coleco Chameleon (unrelated to the Colecovision besides the name) were two consoles that were meant to "bring back" cartridge-based gaming. They were supposed to be able to clone numerous 8-bit and 16-bit consoles as well as play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">retraux</a> indie games. After a lot of criticism and controversy, both consoles ended up being canned during their concept stages.
</li><li> Rumors of a Game Boy successor began leaking in 1996. Nintendo later said it would released at the end of 1997, but it ultimately never came out and instead they released the Game Boy Pocket. Eventually the similar Game Boy Advance would come out in 2001. In 2009 Nintendo released a photographs of the handheld, which was codenamed "Project Atlantis". It started development in 1995 but was canned in 1998 because it was too bulky and expensive to produce at the time.
</li><li> <em>Sharkwire Online</em> was a Nintendo 64 device that allowed the user to visit a special Sharkwire website, even without having an internet connection. There were plans for a Playstation version but it never came out.
</li><li> The "Game Eye" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to the Game Boy Camera. It was due to a mid-2000s release but never came out.
</li><li> It's known that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailsSkyPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailsSkyPatrol">Tails' Skypatrol</a></em> (which wasn't always a <em>Sonic</em> title) started out development for an unknown cancelled handheld similar to a Game Boy.
</li><li> Lately, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariVCS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariVCS">Atari VCS</a>. Originally announced in 2017 for a 2018 release, the release is now pushed back to March 2020. Numerous delays (one to change CPU) has made it a mockery of the PC gamers as well as by fanboys of other consoles. And then, in October 2019, the lead designer of the project quit, leaving Atari with only a prototype motherboard and the schematics. While Atari insists that the project is on schedule and that they've contracted a different company to do debugging and troubleshooting work, the chances of the console actually seeing the light of day is becoming slimmer by the hour. Even the project backers are starting to grow restless and some want their money back.

<ul><li> There are projects in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">application and system software</a> that are older still. The most notorious example is Project Xanadu, the first computer hypertext system and intended to catalog all human knowledge: begun in 1960, still arguably in development, although its creator seemed to have abandoned it for a time before announcing that it had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedFromDevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedFromDevelopmentHell">Saved from Development Hell</a> and was now finished (primarily by him lowering his extremely high expectations so he could say it was finished in his lifetime).
</li><li> A Filipino tech company named BiTMICRO Networks <a class="urllink" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111014005964/en/Philippines<!--E2-->80%99-Industry-Led-Microelectronics-Institute-Unveiled">announced a processor<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> named in honour of Jose Rizal.

Five years later and yet little if any news has surfaced since, and it didn't help that BiTMICRO apparently didn't have any previous experience with processor development, at best being a cloud solutions provider.
</li><li> The GNU Hurd operating system kernel. Once meant to replace the kernel of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UNIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UNIX">UNIX</a>, it long ago lost that honor to Linux, which it is now championed to replace... someday. Meanwhile, the constellation of open-source software meant to be built around it has been Linux-based for <em>decades</em> now and will have to be ported <em>back</em> to its official "home" system if the thing ever sees release. For some perspective, development on the Hurd began in 1984 and the first actual, installable OS based on it came out in 2003; there is yet to be a release of even beta quality. Comparatively, Linux started out in 1991 and had been marked as stable since <em>1994</em>.
</li><li> <em>ReactOS</em>, an attempt to create a drop-in replacement for Windows, has been in development since 1998- although the project still does put out nightly builds, the nightly builds are more than often badly broken. The project started as <em>FreeWin95</em> in 1996 and aimed to create an open-source OS capable of running Windows 95 programs, but then went silent and came back in its current form in 1998, with the aim changed to create an open-source OS capable of running <em>Windows NT 4</em> programs. As of March 2016, the project has only hit 0.4, which the team still considers late-alpha- the team will only change the software state to beta when 0.5 hits. And it took them a whole decade to get from 0.3 to 0.4. Granted, the project was plagued by multiple issues including lack of manpower, several allegations that the project had used stolen Microsoft code which stalled the project for almost a year as the codes are audited, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">perpetually-moving goalposts</a> (as of current, the program has mostly Windows 2000 level compatibility. The team at one point aimed for XP level compatibility by first final release, only to be forced to change it to <em>Windows 7</em> level by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">their sponsors</a> and supporters in 2018).
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-conduction_Electron-emitter_Display">SCEE display<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was vastly superior in both energy efficiency and color reproduction compared to CRTs, LCDs, and Plasma, and was supposed to enter mass-production "real soon now" &mdash; since 1989. Besides production problems, a lawsuit slowed things down in the mid-2000s, followed by the crash of 2008, and Canon finally threw in the towel in 2010 when LED-LCD screens obsoleted the technology.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MacOS">macOS</a> was infamous for its replacement projects that either got stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> (Taligent and Copland) or never even started (Gershwin). In 1996, while on the verge of bankruptcy, Apple finally gave up and bought NeXTSTEP to get Steve Jobs back, which eventually became Mac OS X and helped save the company.
</li><li> Microsoft had several of these in Windows' lifespan, these include:
<ul><li> Windows Neptune &mdash; The consumer version of Windows 2000 with a few features that were instead shifted to XP. Windows Neptune would've required more resources than most consumers had at the time.
</li><li> Not an operating system, but a subsystem to revolutionize data storage, search and retrieval (in other words greatly speed them up): Object File System (OFS). It was started in 1990 or 91 as a part of next-generation operating system, Cairo. While Cairo itself was never released, most of its components were gradually released as part of other MS products: Windows NT, Windows 95, MS SQL Server... Except OFS. The project was shelved, but eventually revisited, now as an extension to MS SQL Server. Then as a part of MS Exchange. Then for Windows Longhorn (as WinFS). According to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS">The Other Wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in 1994-2007 it was cancelled and resurrected no less than 6 times, but haven't been heard from since 2009. All its incarnations have contributed to other MS products, but the desired goal was never met. Since people still would like their computers to instantly find their photos, videos, music, books, text documents and whatever else they edit and store there, by only a vague description, the project is bound to come back yet again.
</li><li> In the early 1990s there was what was codenamed Omega, Microsoft's first attempt at a desktop database. Developers worked on it for a year and a half during which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">snafus accumulated atop delays, and were further beset by complications, with everybody increasingly getting on each others' nerves</a>. Until finally <a class="urllink" href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/2012/10/31/my-terrifying-meeting-with-bill-gates/">one meeting<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with the company's <em>capo di tutti capi</em> led to this exchange:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Bill Gates</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Get fucking recruiting in here, I want fucking recruiting in here right now</a>!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Some unfortunate Microserf</strong>: OK, Bill, why do you want recruiting?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Gates</strong>: Because I want to find out what fuckking colleges we recruited you guys from and tell them not to fucking recruit there any more because they clearly produce fucking idiots!
</div><ul><li> The project was canceled shortly thereafter, with instructions to throw out all the code and start from scratch. From the ashes rose the phoenix that is today Access.

With an impressive 100GB (which is Blu-Ray's maximum storage space) to up to 6TB of storage, it sounded really good. But there's still nothing on the market and with a $15,000 drive and $180 per disk cost along with its original developer going up in smoke, it doesn't look like it's coming out soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersUniverse">Transformers Universe</a></em> by Jagex was going to be a free online... something. It went from MMO to a kind of 'team brawl' all the while frantically insisting that it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeToPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeToPlay">Free-to-Play</a>. The game managed to get to Open Beta. The game got far enough to start putting out 'Founders Packs' ahead of release, then both followers and Jagex seemed to realise just how much of the game you'd end up paying for &mdash; especially considering how expensive the Founders Packs were.
<ul><li> The game even started to put out profiles for the original characters that you would be able to fight as, and many Role-Players on the forum noticed striking similarities between them and their Role-Play characters. The two most blatant were 'Hotwire', a Decepticon Medic who ripped off an RPer called Hotwire, also a Decepticon Medic (the only true difference was the gender), and 'Monsoon', an Autobot warrior whose skills, weapons, personality and even appearance ripped off another RPer's character called Gearchange.

Ten years from concept Vector W2, in 1978, to a production run of seventeen W8s. Then fourteen M12s made in 1996. Then another ten years roll by before the WX-8 prototype turns up at the LA motorshow. As of 2018, the WX-8 itself remains vaporware, though they claim it's <a class="urllink" href="https://carbuzz.com/news/the-vector-wx-8-supercar-could-be-america-s-answer-to-ferrari-and-lamborghini">still in development<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingCar">Moller Skycar</a>. In the words of the SEC when they brought a suit against the company for exaggerating the likelihood of it ever working, "As of late 2002, MI's approximately 40 years of development has resulted in a prototype Skycar capable of hovering about fifteen feet above the ground."
</li><li> Fusion reactors. With a fusion reactor and a glass of water, you could power a city like New York for 3 years. Research has been conducted since the 1950s, at which time they promised the first commercial fusion reactors by the year 2000. For a time, this was a joke on soc.history.what-if: "Kolker's Law: The estimated time until commercial fusion reactors will arrive remains constant." In other words, if an expert believed that fusion was 20 years away 20 years ago, he probably still believes it's 20 years away today. Not to say that progress hasn't been made. The advances in superconducting materials and lasers that modern experimental fusion reactors are built around hadn't been made when fusion research started in the '50s and what is now known as the field of plasma physics hadn't even been recognized fully as a discipline unto itself. Partly the reason why development has been so slow is also <em>because</em> fusion is always deemed of being too far away and too difficult to get any near-term returns from an accelerated effort. Presently several countries are involved in national and international scale projects in fusion and plasma control, and interest has grown, but given the timeframes of experimental research in the field, several decades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare">Vapor Ware</a> are still to be expected.
<ul><li> In the same vein, advanced nuclear fission reactors (such as Gen IV reactors) may fall in this. Their benefits are great: they produce more energy with less fuel and produce less dangerous waste. Some designs eat the waste of the widely deployed Gen II reactors and some are essentially meltdown proof. But with events like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, it seems the prospects of nuclear energy have gone down the tubes in several countries.
<ul><li> In the case of one Gen IV candidate, the Molten Salt Reactor, this is <em>especially</em> frustrating because a <strong>working</strong> prototype of a MSR was built and run for 5 years in the mid '60s (from 1964 until '69) called the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. It didn't generate any electricity with its heat but managed to prove that the concept <strong>was</strong> sound and orders of magnitude more fuel-efficient than the reactors still in use <strong>today</strong> that use solid fuel pellets (&lt;1% efficient to the MSR's &gt;90% fuel efficiency). The planned follow up Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (the more recently proposed Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor, or LFTR (pronounced "lifter") for short, is essentially the MSBR brought into the 21st century.) was never built.

</li><li> Remember all that noise about the "All American Basketball Alliance", an all-white basketball league that was supposed to start in 2010?

</li><li> Immortal's Handbook, a third-party splatbook for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. For awhile, the front page, at a glance, seemed to be 60% "look at all the cool stuff that I'm making!" and 39%, apologizing for not updating or releasing anything for years.

Gary was looking at releasing the complex as early as 1978, but got sucked into the monumental task of writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheTempleOfElementalEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheTempleOfElementalEvil">The Temple of Elemental Evil</a></em> and released only a few levels.

Any hint that Gygax would be releasing new Greyhawk or AD&amp;D material would have sparked a lawsuit.

Co-writer, Jeffrey Talanian was set to complete the project using Gygax's copious notes, but he was fired within six months and the Gygax Games site seems to be all but abandoned. Gygax's original co-writer Rob Kuntz was releasing material from <em>his</em> notebooks, but he has also dropped the project. Finally, a dedicated fan who knew both Gary and Rob and had played in Castle Greyhawk released his own version of the dungeons starting on level 2, which is probably the closest we will ever get to the actual Castle Greyhawk.
</li><li> Speaking of D&amp;D, the 4th edition never received a promised Virtual Tabletop app. With a new edition now replacing the 4th, don't expect to ever see it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.furaffinity.net">Furaffinity.net<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an art gallery that caters to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry Fandom</a>, is notorious for promising new features and updates that never materialize:
<ul><li> Shortly after the site launched in 2006, a rewrite of the entire site was announced (dubbed <em>Ferrox</em>) and that it would be in closed beta "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSoonNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSoonNow">soon</a>". A year later, another announcement was made that a <em>new</em> version of Ferrox was in development. That project was eventually shelved two years later.
</li><li> Another project which would overhaul the UI has seen similar delays, first announced in 2007, having mock-up previews released in 2009, and finally setting a deadline of Summer 2011 for completion, which didn't happen. Dozens of other planned features have gone through similar treatment.
</li><li> Another attempt at re-coding the site was announced in early 2014, an open-source project called <em>Phoenix</em>. There is essentially one person working on the project, and it's all <a class="urllink" href="http://github.com/FurAffinity/phoenix/">on GitHub<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> so you can follow along with the long periods of nothing happening.
</li><li> Around the same time, they announced <em>new</em> plans to overhaul the <em>existing</em> site's UI, which led some to believe even the site's owner doesn't have faith in the "Phoenix" recode ever going anywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> fansite ScoreHero announced a giant (and much needed) update in November 2008. Almost immediately it was shoved on to the back burner for seven months when Harmonix turned up to talk about their idea for the nascent Rock Band Network; several mods and developers signed up to help with the rewrite and were promptly stonewalled when looking for information (RBN had the main admin tied up in NDAs). Said developers were subsequently somewhat disgruntled when the RBN announcement was made, and it's tied up JC's time so much now that the big update hasn't gotten off the back burner since (and, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame">Rhythm Games</a> on their way out, doesn't look likely to).
<ul><li> Until it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedFromDevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedFromDevelopmentHell">pulled forward again in November 2013</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWait">We Wait</a>.

Docfuture, the creator of the video, claims he received his copy of the mysterious game from an uncle, who bought the disc from Chinese bootleggers.

Announced in 2008, with an array of notable football names attached to it as potential coaches and team and league execs. It was slated to launch fully in Spring 2012. That date was then pushed back to 2015 (and that date was later stated as being "overly ambitious"), with still no cities in place as team hosts as of Summer 2017; <em>and</em> a rival league (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A11FL">A-11 Football<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &mdash; formed in the wake of NUSFL's first failure to launch) looking to launch first and steal their thunder, even going so far as to swipe several original USFL team names for their league.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note133ncg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note133ncg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note133ncg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And as of July 2014, A-11 announced they were looking to "re-organize", for all intents and purposes folding.</span>

</li><li> The tabletop game <em>Far West</em> was supposed to be an epic transmedia project, with an intended release date in late 2011. Mid-2018 saw an announcement that it was being revised with a different system, the first kickstarter update in something like a year. Those few backers who still think they'll ever see it have stopped expecting a transmedia project and would be satisfied with an <em>any</em>-media project.
</li><li> Given all of the technological innovation by Apple in the last decade, it seems odd that the one product that stumped them is AirPower, an advanced Qi charger that can charge three devices at once. Apple announced the device in September 2017 and stated it would be released within a few months, but by the end of 2018 Apple had given no updates and removed all mentions of AirPower from their website, though iPhone manuals still mention it. Some reports claim overheating issues caused the delay, and Apple officially cancelled the device in March 2019.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeamFourStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeamFourStar">Team Four Star</a> has a poor track record of delivering on announced original content:
<ul><li> In 2018, Team Four Star showed a short teaser for a wrestling-themed show filmed with action figures called AWF. They still occasionally mention it on social media when asked about future projects, but nothing more has been shown.
</li><li> In 2018, TFS premiered a pilot for an original 2D-animated series called "Fist Master." Although it was announced as a series, no followups have been revealed.
</li><li> The Season 3 finale of DBZA, released in 2018, ended with a teaser card promising a Season 4. Multiple update videos and social media updates throughout 2018 and 2019 made promises about the release window, with the timeline being pushed back every time. In October 2019 an off-hand reference was snuck into an update video that the team was considering making Season 4 with original 3D animation rather than the repurposed anime footage the series was known for. In January 2020, KaiserNeko made a Twitter post that noticeably said that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">IF</a></em> Season 4 was made, it would be done with 3D models. After being bombarded with questions by upset fans, the team finally admitted that Season 4 was cancelled in February of 2020.
