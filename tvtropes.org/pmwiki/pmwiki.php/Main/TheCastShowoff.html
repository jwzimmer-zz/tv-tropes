<ul><li> Ditto with Asuka's Mexican voice actress in the Mexican Spanish dub, the late Norma Echevarr&iacute;a. She even added German <em>profanity</em> not included in the Japanese or even English versions.

<ul><li> The entire motorcycle sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em> was included due to the insistence of McQueen, an avid motorcyclist.

</li><li> At the peak of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a>' career, all of his films went a bit out of their way to feature a scene of him doing a bunch of voices in rapid succession. They didn't have to work that hard to shoehorn them in; his scripts would often have a placeholder that just said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpoDoesSomethingFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpoDoesSomethingFunny">Robin can go off here.</a>" By Williams' own admission he <a class="urllink" href="http://jonathanmccrea.com/2006/12/robin-williams-interview/">threw away the script<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

The film also stands as a statement of director Roman Polanski's enthusiasm for sailing; at times it resembles an instructional video on the sport.
</li><li> In the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> most of the characters sing more or less all the time, but this was scrapped for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">the film versions</a>. After hearing Billy Boyd sing "Delilah" at a karaoke bar, however, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens decided to let Pippin sing. Boyd picked a song from the books, wrote a tune for it, and the result was the scene where Pippin sings to Denethor. Funnily enough, the book specifies "<em>He was not asked to sing.</em>" The vocals are included on the three-disc expanded sets for each film, so if you want to hear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LivTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LivTyler">Liv Tyler</a> singing you know where to go.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> worked as a carpenter before becoming an actor.

<ul><li> Ford also shows these respective skills in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMosquitoCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMosquitoCoast">The Mosquito Coast</a></em>, in which he plays a radical, maverick inventor establishing his brand of civilization in a remote coastal town.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> likes to make use of Jane Krakowski's singing skills by making her character Jenna Maroney an in-universe Cast Showoff.

The whole thing is particularly lampshaded when she forcibly inserts herself into the center of a song and dance number that has absolutely nothing to do with her, much to the mild annoyance of the other characters in the scene.
<ul><li> This was also done with Krakowski a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal">Ally McBeal</a></em>, which make it seem it's Krakowski herself who contractually obligates shows she joins to let her sing. It is a little excessive.
<ul><li> <em>Ally McBeal</em> is an excellent example of this trope all together; everybody in the cast who can remotely carry a tune (and some who can't) takes the stage at the bar at least once.

It is likely that that moment came about because Ryan Murphy and the writers couldn't resist giving two-time Tony Award winner Patti LuPone a song.

</li><li> The mere existence of <em>Caritas</em>, the demon karaoke bar safe-haven where no one is allowed to fight, seems tailor-made to let the cast show their talents or lack thereof. Unsurprisingly, except for Lorne, it's always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">the villains who get the best songs.</a>
<ul><li> Supposedly Caritas and Lorne was created solely because the actor Andy Hallett was a gifted singer (though not professional until much later) and a friend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> contained a short scene of Zack Addy, whose actor Eric Millegan is trained in musical theatre, surprising several of his coworkers by singing.
<ul><li> Emily Deschanel also sings in that episode. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel">Singing runs in the family</a>.)

<ul><li> Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick and Florence Henderson have legitimate singing abilities and were showcased in multiple episodes throughout the series' run.
</li><li> Eve Plumb is a legitimately talented artist, whose work was showcased in several episodes, starting with a detailed drawing of a sparrow that she drew in the first season's "Is There a Doctor in the House?" (In one of the retrospectives of the series, any item that the script called for the kids to make, that particular kid made; sure enough, Eve drew "Jan's" sparrow.)

Considering that his character, "Skinny Pete" is a borderline illiterate low-level drug runner, this comes as a great surprise. For many people, it added some interesting depth to the character.

Notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleTrachtenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleTrachtenberg">Michelle Trachtenberg</a>, who'd had dance training, got a scene where she danced with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a> sang about two lines without accompaniment; her other lines were mostly filler. She reportedly begged Joss not to give her many singing lines because she hated her voice, although when she heard how good she sounded after post-production Hannigan regretted giving up so much singing time. Most notably, the Tara solo "Under Your Spell" was supposed to be a duet with Willow.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaCaulfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaCaulfield">Emma Caulfield</a> apparently surprised Joss Whedon with her singing voice, resulting in the writers giving her another song in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E5Selfless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E5Selfless">Selfless</a>" (in a flashback to "Once More With Feeling").

In an ironic inversion, Gellar also happens to be terrified of graveyards.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> seamlessly blends actor Jeffrey Donovan's extensive martial arts training, skill for accents, and even dancing background into the show, which are justified by his character being an ex-spy who would need to know such things. Curiously, the fight-scenes are often filmed in such a way that Jeffrey's face can't be seen, leading some viewers to think that a stunt-double is used (much to Donovan's frustration).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> episode "The Last Call", the main cast does an impromptu performance of "Piano Man".

Rumor has it, Jon Huertas (Esposito) is pushing for a musical episode.
<ul><li> While not a full episode, he got the chance to show off his tenor in "Swan Song," which dealt with a murdered musician.

</li></ul></li><li> "Interpretive Dance": The dance recital serves as an opportunity for Troy, Britta, and Abed to show off their dancing skills.
</li><li> "Intro to Political Science" and "Studies in Modern Movement" allow Joel McHale to sing. Ironically, he is one of the weakest singers in the cast, but he is decent enough at it
</li><li> "Physical Education": Not only can Joel McHale play pool, he also looks good naked, everybody! Yes, those two facts were related.
</li><li> "Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas": They all sing, and very well by the way (especially Yvette and Alison).
</li><li> Season 5 included Jeff doing a stand-up skit. Joel Mchale is a comedian himself.
</li><li> Danny Pudi shows off his abilities as an impressionist multiple times, doing impressions of Nicholas Cage, Don Draper. and even fellow cast members Joel McHale and Donald Glover.
</li><li> In general, anytime Shirley gets to sing is a chance for Yvette Nicole Brown to go big.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> had an episode in its first season where Heathcliff participates in a senior's track and field event. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> ran track at Temple University.

<ul><li> He's also an artist. In one episode, when Reid (Gubler's character) makes a sketch of an unsub who approached him in the metro, it's his actual work.
</li></ul></li><li> On original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>, Gary Dourdan showed off his piano skills in one episode.

</div></li><li> Creator/Burt Reynolds on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanAugust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanAugust">Dan August</a></em>: In almost every episode, Burt got to make use of his football skills. He'd make flying tackles of fleeing suspects or do other sorts of physical stunts, like sliding down the middle of a church on his belly. The opening credits show quite a few of these moments. Burt was a college football star at the University of Florida prior to becoming an actor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em> has become a fountain of this. If an actor does reasonably well on the show, you can almost expect them to have a character dance soon after. Chelsea Kane danced on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabyDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabyDaddy">Baby Daddy</a></em> as did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaJoanHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelissaJoanHart">Melissa Joan Hart</a> and Joey Lawrence on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelissaAndJoey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MelissaAndJoey">Melissa &amp; Joey</a>.</em> Many times, they'll cast their partner from <em>Dancing</em> to be their partner on their new show as well.
</li><li> The sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DearJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DearJohn">Dear John</a></em> featured an episode in which ultra-nerdy, socially incompetent Ralph Drang got out onto the dance floor&mdash;and suddenly turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredAstaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredAstaire">Fred Astaire</a>, courtesy of actor Harry Groener (a full-fledged professional dancer).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> has done this a lot. Craig's band is the actor's real life band, and Ashley (who also once was in a couple of bands) in real life has said she loves singing.
</li><li> Dixie Carter, who played Julia Sugarbaker on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesigningWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesigningWomen">Designing Women</a></em>, sang frequently on that show as part of a bargain with the head writer: Whenever the left-leaning Julia spouted a rant that ran counter to Dixie's (conservative) politics, Dixie got to sing in the next episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiagnosisMurder">Diagnosis: Murder</a></em> showcased everybody's "hidden" talents at some point: Dick Van Dyke got to dance, sing, and perform magic (although how good he was depended on the writer); Victoria Rowell had an episode in which she displayed her ballet training (referenced once or twice before); Barry Van Dyke did some boxing.
</li><li> Much of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a></em> revolves around the talents of the writers of a sketch-comedy show. Buddy's one-liners, Sally's voice, Rob's Dick-van-dyke-ness. Mary Tyler Moore was allowed to showoff just as frequently.
</li><li> Mike Rowe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DirtyJobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DirtyJobs">Dirty Jobs</a></em>. Full stop. The guy can do <em>anything</em>, and every episode showcases this. He's even a classically-trained opera singer!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDoctorBlakeMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDoctorBlakeMysteries">The Doctor Blake Mysteries</a></em>: In "Bedlam", we get a couple of long sequences of Blake playing the piano, with the camera circling to make sure we can tell it's Craig McLachlan himself playing...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonSmall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SharonSmall">Sharon Small</a>, a classically trained lyric soprano, got to show off her serious vocal talents at the end of her guest spot on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorFinlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorFinlay">Doctor Finlay</a></em> when she performed the classic Irish ballad "Carrickfergus".

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton">Patrick Troughton</a>:
<ul><li> One of the Second Doctor's standard maneuvers was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent">Wig, Dress, Accent</a>, which was deliberately written in to exploit how the Doctor was now played by an extremely versatile character actor who could convincingly alter his entire appearance just by affecting a different voice and mannerisms. Good examples are "Doktor von Wer" and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessLadyDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessLadyDisguise">Harmless Lady Disguise</a> from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E4TheHighlanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E4TheHighlanders">The Highlanders</a>", and the deliberately convoluted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmHeAsYouAreHe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmHeAsYouAreHe">I Am He as You Are He</a> situation in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E4TheEnemyOfTheWorld">The Enemy of the World</a>" where he gets to play the Doctor, the Doctor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalDoppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalDoppelganger">Criminal Doppelg&auml;nger</a>, and both of them pretending to be each other, or pretending to be the other pretending to be them - some viewers even find that the Doctor and his lookalike come across so differently that <em>they don't look remotely like each other</em>, almost breaking the plot.
</li><li> Troughton, in real life, loved playing the recorder and carried one about with him to play in idle moments, a quirk that got written into the character. The recorder the Second Doctor uses was his own.
</li><li> The Second Doctor's ability to obsessively read people's social dynamics started when Gerry Davis was fascinated by Troughton's ability to do the same.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>:
<ul><li> Had a fascination for gadgets and cars, which cropped up in the Third Doctor's stories. In fact, one car used by the Doctor during his run, known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">affectionately by fans</a> as "The Whomobile", was Pertwee's own personal property, and not a BBC prop. This is why it is never seen or mentioned again after "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E5PlanetOfTheSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS11E5PlanetOfTheSpiders">Planet of the Spiders</a>", unlike Bessie, the more often seen yellow roadster.
</li><li> Another of his Doctor's quirks was that he was into martial arts, particularly 'Venusian aikido'. Pertwee was a highly-skilled martial artist and tried to do his own stunts whenever possible (although a lot of the time the fight scenes aren't much more elaborate than running up to someone, lightly touching their arm and yelling 'hai').
</li><li> Pertwee was a well-loved and accomplished singer and voice actor, and one of his Doctor's quirks is a fondness for singing in idle moments, usually in a funny voice or a bang-on impersonation of the original artist.
</li><li> Pertwee was also an accomplished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicalOverreacting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicalOverreacting">gurner</a>. Several scenes were written which gave Pertwee an excuse to do his amazing face-pulling.

<ul><li> Could pop his already large, wide eyes partway out of his sockets. After a few years, him doing this in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeTake">Eye Take</a> was a standard cliffhanger lead-in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> was given an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrickStewartSpeech">Patrick Stewart Speech</a> in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace">The Ark in Space</a>" was to show off the then-newly cast Baker's speaking ability - both in terms of his ability to pull off the kind of soliloquies that his predecessor would never have been able to, and in terms of showing off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfDramatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfDramatic">gorgeous voice</a>, with which the production team was universally infatuated.

This is because scriptwriter Stephen Wyatt had assumed that he could juggle because of his background, and it was late in the production that he admitted to the director that he was unable to do the juggling scene that had originally been written.

They wanted the public to first hear them sing as John Schneider and Tom Wopat, not as Bo and Luke Duke. After the series ended, both went into careers as country music singers. Schneider was the slightly more successful of the two. And what happened?

</li><li> Happens often in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>. Sometimes it's just as simple as being particularly great at dancing, playing an instrument, or (shocker!) singing, but there are also often showcases for if the performer is accomplished at gymnastics, yodeling, or some other such unique skill. One of the most famous examples is Norway's Alexander Rybak, who both sang and played the violin in his song "Fairytale" and won the contest.
<ul><li> A variant is when the performers write their own songs, such as Katrina and the Waves or ABBA.
</li><li> Happens a lot with the hosts as well, especially if they're singers in their own right. The first time this happened was when famous Swedish singer and entertainer (as well as a former Eurovision representative herself) Lill Lindfors hosted in 1985, which began with her singing a song about the joys of music. Happened again the two years after that, when Norwegian folk singer &Aring;se Kleveland (also a former Eurovision representative - same year as Lill, in fact) hosted in 1986 and when Belgian pop star Viktor Lazlo hosted in 1987. Downplayed for a while after that, as most contests opted to use TV and radio presenters as hosts, but it would show up again in years like:
<ul><li> 1991 - both hosts were former Eurovision winners and took a good chunk of time at the start of the show to reprise their respective winning songs.
</li><li> 1996 - co-host Morten Harket, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aha">a-ha</a> fame, performed his newest single as an opening act.
</li><li> 1997 - similarly, co-host Ronan Keating of Irish boy band <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boyzone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boyzone">Boyzone</a> joined his bandmates to perform the interval act
</li><li> 2002 - one host was an opera singer and the other was a Shakespearean actor, and both would make sure you were aware of those facts several times.
</li><li> 2003 - both hosts had represented Latvia at Eurovision in the past and sang in the interval act.
</li><li> 2006 - Greek singer Sakis Rouvas and Greek-American TV host/model Maria Menounos got to sing a bit of "Love Shine a Light" at the beginning of the semi-final.
</li><li> 2008 - subtly: co-host Zeljko Joksimovic, a famous Serbian singer-songwriter and composer who had represented his country and others at Eurovision (and would again in the future), actually wrote that year's Serbian entry (and it finished sixth)!
</li><li> 2011 - co-host Stefan Raab took every possible opportunity to show off his skills as a multi-instrumentalist, taking both drum and guitar solos at different points in the shows.
</li><li> 2012 - Eldar Gasimov, one of the co-hosts and half of the previous year's winning duo Ell &amp; Nikki, joined his duet partner and several other former Eurovision champs for a rendition of "Waterloo" during one of the semis.
</li><li> 2013 - Petra Mede, a famous comedian and TV host in Sweden, not only hosted the whole show herself; she also performed an elaborate musical interval act called "Swedish Smorgasbord," not only showing off a good sense of humor about Sweden's international image, but also a good singing voice!
</li><li> 2014 - co-host Pilou Asb&aelig;k displayed decent Chinese skills, for whatever reason.
</li><li> 2016 - Petra Mede returned, as did the previous year's champ M&aring;ns Zelmerlow, with both performing elaborate songs making fun of and celebrating Eurovision and the latter performing his winning song "Heroes" and a new single.
</li></ul></li><li> Among the talents contestants have displayed beyond singing: magic tricks (Estonia's J&uuml;ri Pootsmann in 2016), drumming (a whole bunch, including Bulgaria's drum-happy duo Elitsa and Stoyan in 2007 and 2013 and Romania's Luminita Anghel in 2005), flute-playing (Finland's Vesa-Matti Loiri in 1980 and Slovenia's Tinkara Kova&ccedil; in 2014), piano- and guitar-playing (too many to list, but special props to Ireland's Paul Harrington and Charlie <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGettigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGettigan">Mc Gettigan</a>, who accompanied themselves on piano and guitar with no orchestra or playback and won handily), violin-playing (major examples being Switzerland's Egon Egemann in 1990 and Sebalter in 2014, Estonia's Sandra Nurmsalu of Urban Symphony in 2009, and not one but two Norwegian winners: Secret Garden's Fionnuala Sherry in 1995 and the aforementioned Alexander Rybak in 2009 and his return attempt in 2018), unicycling (Moldova's Zdobi si Zdub in 2011), saxophone-playing (Moldova's SunStroke Project in both 2010 and 2017; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">no prizes for guessing who</a>), and plenty more either mentioned here or where that came from.

</li><li> A rescue of a drunken Steve Urkel on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> served a dual purpose: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> about teenage drinking, and a chance for Telma Hopkins to show off her tightrope act from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfTheStars">Circus Of The Stars</a></em>.
<ul><li> Jaleel White was also a fan of martial arts (and was also building muscle), so one episode has him transform into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a> using his special chamber. This was revived for two other episodes.

Barry's actor Grant Gustin in real life is trained in musical theatre and aspires to be on Broadway, Glee was his biggest break.
<ul><li> Joe's Earth-2 doppelg&auml;nger was a jazz singer and sang the standard "Where or When". Makes since given Jesse L.

The episode contains five song numbers, two of which are original and written for the episode: "Superfriend" and "Come Running Home To You." And the cast did all the dance numbers too: the choreographer who did the steps worked on Glee before with Grant and the Warblers cast.

He does it quite brilliantly &mdash; he's also the singer of the ending credits theme "Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs".
<ul><li> Both Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce can play the piano and demonstrate this several times on the show. As Hyde Pierce isn't as good a singer but a better pianist than Grammer, Niles is often called upon to play the piano while Frasier sings.
</li><li> Wendie Malick, who appears as lounge singer Ronee Lawrence in Frasier's final season, sings at the drop of a hat. The most egregious example is where she sits at the piano singing about the Crane family breakfast to the tune of several well-known songs. (She also has a song-and-dance routine, but that's in a dream sequence of Martin Crane's, so we'll let her off.)
</li><li> Jane Leeves is a trained dancer and got to demonstrate this ability a couple of times on the show, most notably in the episode "Moon Dance". Her flexibility comes in handy in later seasons when she gets to show off yoga moves.
</li><li> Despite playing all-American dad Martin, John Mahoney is actually from Liverpool and in one episode mocked Daphne's Mancunian accent by mimicking it rather eerily. Ironically, Daphne's Mancuian accent is put on; Jane Leeves is actually from London.

</li><li> Alfonso Ribeiro's dance experience was put to use several times, notably in "Sooooooooul Train" and "Strip-Tease for Two." Subverted in that Ribeiro's character Carlton Banks was famous for having outdated taste in dance moves, despite his innate skill.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> with John Stamos' music skills, who has toured with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> (he also played drums and sang backing vocals on an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em> episode). Dave Coulier also showed off his skills in cartoon impressions very frequently, mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a>. Also, he gets to showcase his hockey playing skills in a few episodes.

His actor Jerome Flynn was a pop singer back in the nineties. Another character compliments Bronn for his singing voice. Musical theatre star Kerry Ingram (Shireen) is also given a chance to show off her skills.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GarthMarenghisDarkplace">Garth Marenghis Darkplace</a></em>, where one episode has an inserted music video of supporting actor Todd Rivers, featuring a "rap" by Dean Lerner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em> had an entire annual event called the Nurses' Ball, which was used to get the cast to show off their chops. Many years prominently featured Jack Wagner and Rick Springfield singing (both had top 10 hits in the '80s) and Kelly Monaco ballroom dancing (she was the first winner of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em>).
</li><li> Lorelai in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> is shown singing some times. While not a professional, Lauren Graham certainly has a good voice and (AFAIK) is very knowledgeable about music, which may have helped her character's endless witty references.
<ul><li> Rory showed off her Spanish speaking in one episode while speaking to one of Emily's maids. In real life, Alexis Bledel is actually Latina. This also came up during interviews for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSisterhoodOfTheTravelingPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSisterhoodOfTheTravelingPants">The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a></em>; Bledel surprised fellow Latina actress America Ferrera when she spoke Spanish to an interviewer.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GimmeABreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GimmeABreak">Gimme a Break!</a></em>, they let star Nell Carter (a veteran Broadway performer) strut her vocal stuff practically every chance they got, even bringing in musical guest stars for her to sing with. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfThemeTune">And guess who sang the theme song?</a>) Ironically, they cut back on that sort of thing once Telma Hopkins (formerly of Tony Orlando and Dawn) joined the cast. Then they ramped them back up when Joey and Matthew Lawrence joined the cast.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> is made to show off the entire cast's singing abilities, there are a few scenes that show Heather Morris (Brittany), Harry Shum Jr. (Mike), and Matthew Morrison's (Will) dancing abilities. Even when the whole group is dancing in unison, if you watch Morris and Shum, their moves are always far cleaner than the rest of the cast. Morris was cast after she was brought on to teach Chris Colfer the Single Ladies dance, as she had recently finished touring with Beyonce.
<ul><li> Special notice goes to the "Special Education" episode, where Morris and Shum get a spectacular swing dance duet during "Valerie", and "The Substitute", where Shum and Morrison do a jaw dropping comedy-dance routine to "Make Em Laugh".
</li><li> "I Am Unicorn" shows off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer">Chris Colfer</a>'s (Kurt) skill with Sai swords. It's pretty damn awesome.
</li><li> Prior to Glee, Kevin McHale was in a boyband, and before the addition of Harry and Heather, was said to have been among the cast's best dancers. While he spends most of his time in a wheelchair, he does learn all the routines standing up. His character has been given two dream sequences, giving McHale a chance to show off his dance skills. The first dream sequence was plot related, but the second, in which he performs Michael Jackson's 'Scream', was probably an excuse for him to show off.
</li><li> It was pretty obvious that Gwyneth Paltrow and later Kate Hudson's guest starring roles were mainly used as a tool for the actresses to show off their singing (and in the latter case's dancing) abilities.
</li><li> Darren Criss sung and played piano for both Teenage Dream and Against All Odds live.
</li><li> Many cast members showcase their abilities with instruments as well: Mark Salling (Puck), Kevin McHale (Artie) and Chord Overstreet (Sam) all play guitar and Cory Monteith (Finn) plays the drums.

The sharp contrast between this and his in-character hick accent stopped being striking or funny fairly quickly.
<ul><li> It had already been shown a few times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAndyGriffithShow">The Andy Griffith Show</a></em>, alongside Griffith's singing, guitar playing, and unique storytelling style.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2uy3f');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2uy3f" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2uy3f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">These days, his singing is what he's better known for; he had sung "Back Home Again in Indiana" before the Indianapolis 500 for decades and would continue to do so until he passed away in 2012.</span>

<ul><li> PJ is the guitarist for his band, and Jason Dolley plays the guitar in real-life as well as the piano.
</li><li> Spencer and Emmet both can dance and they have a dance-off in which they take turns serving each other.
</li><li> Teddy (Brigit Mendler) has a few chances to sing on the show, once for a talent show, a contest, and an audition for a school musical.
<ul><li> Her friend Skylar does a duet with Teddy for the talent show, but they combine with PJ and Emmet's band and mash-up both songs and subsequentally win the talent show.
</li></ul></li><li> Leigh-Allyn Baker appears for have professional dance training, and Amy Duncan tries to teach her family simple and complicated dance moves and routines in an episode when she wants them to do a song and dance number for her hospital's fundraiser. When they don't even try to duplicate what she just showed them, she asks, "what are you waiting for?" and Teddy says "10 years for dance lessons." Which may be a hint to Leigh-Allyn having dance training, or could just be a joke, or both. She even gets an applause track played after the more complicated part of her routine, probably pointing to the former.

Sometimes, the contestant, in particular, can't sing - the usual answer to this is to just have them sing off-key with a piano for support, followed by them singing off-key with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">ABSURD AWESOME-NESS</a> for support.

When Ben Powers (Keith) joined the cast, they let him do impressions at every opportunity. Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson">Janet Jackson</a> (Penny) showcased her Mae West impression far more than her singing abilities.

In prior versions of the property (a radio series and two film serials), Kato was merely Reid's valet and the Hornet's sidekick, and he did not demonstrate any notable fighting skills, much less martial arts mastery. Owing to Lee's status as a martial arts master, his Kato was given every chance to show that mastery on the air. This has influenced subsequent adaptations of the property; it is probably now unthinkable for Kato <em>not</em> to be a martial arts master in any new adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenHornet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenHornet">The Green Hornet</a></em> in any medium.
</li><li> The entire point of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode">"Song Beneath the Song"</a>: nearly all of the characters sing at one point, but the focus is on Callie (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaraRamirez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaraRamirez">Sara Ramirez</a>), Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Owen (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinMcKidd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinMcKidd">Kevin McKidd</a>), all of whom have excellent voices. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChylerLeigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChylerLeigh">Chyler Leigh</a> also gets some solos in, and since the episode barely give her story it's clear that they're just using the voices. Ramirez even has a Tony for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Spamalot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Spamalot">Spamalot</a></em>.
</li><li> While the central character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> is already a professional singer (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>), the show also worked as a platform for Mitchell Musso's (Oliver) rising singing career. Again, it's Disney. Coincidentally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a> guest-starred on an episode as a singer (though the vocals were recorded by someone else), years before her singing career began.
</li><li> The later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> had a lot of Anson Williams [Potsie] breaking into song for various flimsy reasons. Granted, his character was a singer, but after a while it got blatant. The "Pumps Your Blood" song he nominally used to memorize the cardiovascular system for an anatomy test is a good (and catchy) example.
<ul><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark">Jumping the Shark</a> episode was done in part because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryWinkler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryWinkler">Henry Winkler</a> was a good water-skiier.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHardyBoysNancyDrewMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHardyBoysNancyDrewMysteries">The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries</a></em>: Shaun Cassidy (who played Joe Hardy) had a successful singing career outside the show. A number of episodes featured Joe singing either with his "band back home in Bayport" or with whatever musical act happened to be in the show that week. Luckily, the show worked around this through the running gag of his brother Frank never sticking around to hear Joe perform. The plot follows Frank, with cut-backs to Joe's performance.
<ul><li> Parker Stevenson was also a good surfer in real life. One episode, "Wipe Out" had a silly contrived mechanism of Frank Hardy placing in a national surfing competition, just to get the boys to Hawaii and in the middle of a hotel theft ring.
</li></ul></li><li> The new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFive0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HawaiiFive0">Hawaii Five-0</a></em> introduces the ME, Max, as he's playing the piano. It's partly to reinforce Max's quirky character, and partly to showcase Masi Oka's piano skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hellcats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hellcats">Hellcats</a></em> allowed Sharon Leal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale">Ashley Tisdale</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonMichalka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonMichalka">Alyson Michalka</a> to not just show off their physical agility but also their vocal chops. Especially Aly Michalka (compare Tisdale sharing a number with 3OH!3 to Michalka having whole solos). Especially when her sister came onto the show...
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, Micah plays the piano, showing off Noah Gray-Cabey's musical talents. (This was a major part of his role on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyWifeAndKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyWifeAndKids">My Wife and Kids</a></em>.)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouiseFletcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouiseFletcher">Louise Fletcher</a> got to use American Sign Language in a guest spot on <em>Heroes</em>. She learned it in her childhood, as both her parents were deaf.
<ul><li> Considering both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell">Kristen Bell</a> are not averse to bursting into song onscreen - the former even did it in her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em> days; <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGp5KxClHSE">see for yourself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> - it's curious how NBC never "suggested" they do a bit of vocalizing. (Then again, maybe they just couldn't find a logical way to fit it in.)
</li></ul></li><li> Hiro's swordplay was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka">Masi Oka</a> showing off his kendo skills (he's a <em>shodan</em>), no stunt training required.
</li></ul></li><li> A part of the reason Joe Dawson owned a blues bar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> was so that Jim Byrnes could show off his skill as a guitarist and blues singer.
</li><li> Hilariously subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em> - Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink) was a world-class violinist, and the son of a classical composer and noted orchestral conductor. Klink, on the other hand, played the violin like a cat losing a fight with a band saw. However, other episodes did showcase the singing talents of the cast (noticeably Robert Clary, Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis). Bob Crane also got to show off his drumming chops in one episode. (He also played the drums for the show's theme music.)
<ul><li> It should be noted that Klink could play one song perfectly: The American National Anthem
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zachery Ty Bryan is a saxophonist in real life and got to show off his skill at it on a few episodes.
</li><li> He also got to show his soccer playing as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> is not only the world's greatest diagnostician, he sings, plays the guitar and the piano, and is an amateur magician. Of course, the same applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie">Hugh Laurie</a>, who plays him &mdash; except for the "diagnostician" bit (the closest he gets to that is being the son of a doctor). The writers' success at not making it too blatant varies. They have at least succeeded at not making House a novelist (that we know of). Which Hugh Laurie also is, of course. There's not much Hugh Laurie doesn't seem to be doing, so that some of it would rub off on his character seems inevitable.
<ul><li> Hugh Laurie has also shown off his musical talent in other roles, particularly that of Bertie Wooster of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster">Jeeves and Wooster</a></em>. What makes the <em>Jeeves and Wooster</em> thing even more remarkable is that there's no dubbing in those scenes. He's playing the piano and singing AND acting like an upper-class twit. Nice.
</li><li> A season five episode of <em>House</em> had Hugh Laurie play both the piano and the harmonica AT THE SAME TIME. How's that for show off?
</li><li> Luckily for the show, the character of House is such that he is the type that <em>would</em> actually go out and learn all these things, either because he's bored and just needs to fill time (magic, most likely) or he wanted to prove that it could be done (anything music related). The character is ever learning, as demonstrated by his taking cooking classes.
</li><li> One of the more justified examples as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> (upon whom House is based) was an accomplished violinist.
</li><li> A season seven episode featured a musical dream sequence which allowed Hugh Laurie to show off his vocal range (again) while also giving Lisa Edelstein a chance to show off her pipes.
</li><li> Whilst Hugh Laurie's real talent is performing a flawless American accent every week (when Bryan Singer first cast him, he didn't realize he was English), there is a fun twist on this trope in an early episode when House calls a hospital in the middle of the night and pretends to be calling from the UK, using the excuse that he's not rude, he just forgot the time difference. What's really brilliant about this to British fans is that the accent he uses <em>isn't Hugh Laurie's real accent</em>. It's the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">upper-class-twit</a>" voice he used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JeevesAndWooster">Bertie Wooster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackAdder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackAdder">the Prince Regent</a>.
</li><li> He also juggles while discussing the diagnosis-of-the-week in "Clueless" - his giant tennis ball, the Magic 8-Ball, and a pencil case - and while three-ball juggling is pretty basic, juggling differently-shaped objects adds a few layers of difficulty.
</li></ul></li><li> Barney in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> does anything to impress the ladies, and magic tricks are just one of those things. He even had an intervention... and magic is just one of the many talents of the great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris">NPH</a>.
<ul><li> NPH seems to be the go-to when the writers need someone to do a long bit, such as when he rattled off a whole bunch of reality show elimination catchphrases.
</li><li> You can't forget the oft-gratuitous singing, either (harmonizing to 'Silent Night', anyone?), and NPH is far from the only one. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> has also showcased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonSegel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonSegel">Jason Segel</a>'s singing and piano-playing talents with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">totally awesome</a> Slapsgiving song, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">infamous</a> Robin Sparkles videos let Cobie Smulders show off <em>her</em> pipes too. Why there has not been a musical episode for this show yet is beyond me.
</li><li> And the 100th episode, "Girls vs. Suits" gives us NPH, Jason Segel, Josh Radnor, Cobie Smulders, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a> singing a musical number - "Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit". And it is, you guessed it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">legendary</a>.
</li><li> Josh Radnor (Ted) gets his chance with his song about the "Super Date" in "Of Course". Really it's only Alyson Hannigan who (quite openly) can't sing.
</li><li> Josh Radnor also utilizes his apparent fluency in ASL in at least 2 episodes. Ted's use of ASL is worked into the plots fairly gracefully.
</li><li> In the seventh season, Neil and Cobie have another chance to show their talents with an impressive dance number, and later in the season, Neil and Josh get to sing again when Barney and Ted have a duet parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>' "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" about the impromptu bar they opened in Ted's apartment.

</li><li> Season 9 allowed Cristin Milotti, aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mother</span> to show her singing skills.

Her actress, Karla Souza, is fluent in all three languages.
</li><li> In Episode 12 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HumanTarget">Human Target</a></em>, Jackie Earle Haley (who has a Black Belt) uses some of his martial arts skills.

In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hunter">Hunter</a></em> McCall went undercover as a nightclub singer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: Sam/Jennette shows off her dancing skills in "iDream of Dance" and "iWas A Pageant Girl".

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> seemed determined to showcase Desi Arnaz's singing performances whenever possible, usually running longer than preferable and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">lacking any relevance to the episode's plot</a>. (But, after all, he was the producer.)
<ul><li> William Frawley and Vivian Vance also occasionally got chances to sing or perform with no relation to comedy. Lucy's performances were never played straight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItAintHalfHotMum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItAintHalfHotMum">It Ain't Half Hot Mum</a></em> (which focused on a British Army "Concert Party" stationed in Burma during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>) allowed the whole cast to showcase their talents, notably Don Estelle's singing. The trope is subverted in one episode where an outside recruit is brought in and proceeds to demonstrate his many impressive talents - singing, playing the piano, tap dance, ventriloquism and more. In the end, the men conspire to get rid of him because he risks replacing Lofty, who will then have to be posted "up the jungle".
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CatherineBell">Catherine Bell</a> (Mac) often got the chance to speak Farsi, a langauge in which she is proficient.

Considering how two of them were playing characters who are essentially career soldiers, those scenes don't stand out all that much.
<ul><li> The third episode of features a scene where Len, portrayed by karate champion Matt Mullins, trains on a rooftop. Although it makes sense for the character, the scene has absolutely no plot relevance. Looks good, though...
</li><li> Another example is the fight between him and Danny Cho/taekwondo martial artist and stuntman Mike Moh. The scene is both relevant <em>and</em> looks good with Daytime Emmy Award.
</li><li> Later in the season, there's a sparring scene between Len and the Advent Master, played by Mark Dacascos. That scene exists to show off their skills.
</li><li> As far back as the original series' "Let's Go Rider Kick" (performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroshiFujioka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroshiFujioka">Hiroshi Fujioka</a>), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> series have featured insert songs performed by the lead actors in order to show off their singing skills. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Den-O</a></em> takes the cake for allowing star Takeru Satoh to show off his singing, acting, and even break-dancing skills. In fact, odds are Ryutaros' penchant for breakdancing was created entirely to allow Satoh more opportunities to show off.
</li><li> Nearly the entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva">Kamen Rider Kiva</a></em> getting to show off their vocal chops during things like the Holy Fang Christmas live show. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KgAnayKAoo=related">Koji<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyO3h97ySFw&amp;feature=related">Seto<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOD_kF5ElHY">Kenji Matsuda<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> especially.

Gentaro chooses Double Dutch, which is Sota Fukushi's specialty; likewise, JK (Shion Tsuchida) chooses breakdancing.
</li><li> The Hyper Battle Video of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGaim">Kamen Rider Gaim</a></em> had Gaku Sano, Yutaka Kobayashi and Yuumi Shida showing off their interests, most notably Yutaka's baking skills. Yutaka even briefly had a web series called "Yuta Caf&eacute;", where he would bake things for the other cast members. And during the Baron focus episode of Gaim Gaiden, this comes into play again when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Shapur</a> bakes a cake for Mai.
<ul><li> Because <em>Gaim</em> initially centers on teams of street dancers, several members of the cast were talented in that field and got to show it off both in dance sequences and unmorphed fights. It's quite noticable that Kouta is more far more nimble when he's untransformed (and played by Gaku Sano) than he is once he changes into Gaim (at which point suit actor Seiji Takaiwa takes over).

Besides Tsukui being her own suit actress, she also got plenty of unmorphed fights to show off her martial arts skills.

<ul><li> And also a total subversion of this trope: although Orbach was a Tony Award-winning song-and-dance man (even released an album!), his character never sang a note on the show and even claimed in one episode he knew nothing about music!

<ul><li> He also tickled the ivories in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Raines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Raines">Raines</a></em>.

Granted, the show was <em>created</em> by Scheving himself, but still...
<ul><li> There was one scene where Sportacus made the simple act of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMa_dUe3tgw">writing a letter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> look like an exhausting gymnastic workout.

The rest of the team quietly panic when he's forced to sing to prove his identity, but of course, Victor Garber is a veteran of Broadway musicals, and Stein brings even a high-ranking Nazi to tears with a rendition of an "original song" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">Edelweiss</a>.

<ul><li> Also, that painting of Nate's "ancestor" (a stylized version of Nate, really) that Hardison claimed to paint himself - yeah, that was really painted by the actor himself.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Life" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Life">Life</a></em> makes good use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahShahi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahShahi">Sarah Shahi</a>'s fluency in Farsi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivingSingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivingSingle">Living Single</a></em> gave T. C. Carson (Kyle) and Queen Latifah (Khadijah) many opportunities to show off their singing abilities.

Several other episodes included moments where he would show off his skills as an impressionist (notably of John Wayne and Jack Benny).
<ul><li> Season 5's "Movie Tonight" did this both for Burghoff and for Loretta Swit, who sang "C'est Magnifique" during a break in the film screening.

<ul><li> Ironically, it was the <em>lack</em> of cast showoffs that sank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a> when word got around that the cast didn't play their own instruments, though Peter and Michael were actually gifted musicians and Micky became a passable drummer ("It's not brain surgery" as he put it). Davy never played anything more complicated than a tambourine.
</li><li> The Monkees were quite capable of singing in close harmony, as demonstrated in an episode that aired around Christmas where they sang an acapella version of the Spanish carol <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_hlYgCNFZc">"Riu Riu Chiu"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Cybill Shepherd and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a> are both guilty of this charge, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em> and off - but especially Cybill, whose penchant for working her pipes into her projects makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScarlettJohansson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScarlettJohansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> seem like Scott Speedman in <em>Duets.</em>
</li><li> Many scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MorkAndMindy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MorkAndMindy">Mork &amp; Mindy</a></em> were just excuses for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> to let loose with his improvisational comedy act. Considering that Williams' manic act was considerably funnier than the average episode's script this was an improvement that was obvious enough to the producers to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpoDoesSomethingFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarpoDoesSomethingFunny">specific gaps in the scripts</a> where he could improvise to his heart's &mdash; and the audience's &mdash; content.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> grant big musical numbers to puppeteers with particularly great singing voices, including Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, and West End actress Louise Gold. <em>Sesame</em> did the same for both human characters (Northern Calloway, Alan Muraoka, Lillian White, Alaina Reed Hall, Bob McGrath) and puppeteers (Stephanie D'Abruzzo, John Tartaglia) with established careers either in music or theater. Bob, in particular, was famous for being a soloist on the series <em>Sing Along with Mitch</em> in the '60s, leading him to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">a teen idol in Japan</a> - naturally, Bob's job on the show was as a voice teacher.
<dl><dd><ul><li> And some just happen to be talented and don't even have those excuses - Emilio Delgado (Luis) got to show off his guitar skills, and former puppeteer Kevin Clash (best known for Elmo) got to show off his vocal range a great deal.
</li></ul></dd></dl></li><li> During the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em> Season 10, the cast had a karaoke night in which Mouna Traor&eacute;, who plays Rebecca James, "blew everyone&#146;s mind". This was the direct inspiration for her choir subplot in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyLivingDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyLivingDoll">My Living Doll</a></em>: <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieNewmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieNewmar">Julie Newmar</a> was an accomplished dancer when she was signed to play Rhoda the robot in this short-lived sitcom. She has said in interviews that she approached the role in part as a dance performance; this is clearly noticeable in episodes like "The Pool Shark". Newmar is also a skilled classical pianist, so Rhoda was allowed to show off her musical talents in "The Beauty Contest".
</li><li> While Mike/Joel and the bots all took turns at songs and musical riffs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> (including Mike Nelson being the singer of the Mike-era theme songs), Kevin Murphy's Tom Servo had the lion's share, making use of his powerful singing voice. Ironic, considering he was the smallest robot. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ree220FiOEg">Case in point.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<ul><li> The Invention Exchange skits which kicked off most of Joel's episodes were specifically devised to make use of Joel's skills as a prop comedian. That's why they were dropped when Mike took over.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville">Nashville</a></em> runs on this trope, since most of the cast play either professional or aspiring singers/musicians and the ones who play guitar also do their own playing. That said, Juliette doing a solo number in church <em>in front of</em> the choir settles it for her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>: In the episode "Forced Entry" Special Agent Gibbs tosses a football to a kid going deep, with a perfect spiral and everything.

<ul><li> "Pretty good"? She used to do Broadway!
</li></ul></li><li> Every episode, Abby is this. Pauley Perrette has a degree in criminology.
<ul><li> Similarly, but inverted, David McCallum (Ducky) prepared for his part like a method actor, and eventually became good enough to act as a consultant. Whether he does so now or not is unknown, but according to some DVD extras, he's been asked to speak at professional forensics conferences!
</li></ul></li><li> During a guest appearance, Bob Newhart's character conducts a brief reprise of Newhart's signature "one-sided telephone call" schtick.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewGirl">New Girl</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel">Zooey Deschanel</a> singing constantly, including creating an in-universe theme song in front of the other characters, one of whom asks "if she just made up a theme song for herself".
<ul><li> Zooey sings a full two and a half minute long theme song, which is cut down to 15 seconds on the show itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewsroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewsroom">The Newsroom</a></em> showcased Olivia Munn's fluency in Japanese in an episode about the radiation as a result of the Fukushima Earthquake. A later episode also had Jeff Daniels and former Broadway actor John Gallagher Jr. sing and play the guitar.
</li><li> Harry Stone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>, played by magician/comedian Harry Anderson, is prone to doing magic tricks and playing practical jokes. Since this was established as part of his character fairly early on, it's not too blatant.
<ul><li> He also played a magician named Jack Fable when he took a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesameStreetCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesameStreetCred">"Sesame Street" Cred</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC">The O.C.</a></em> included an episode in which Sandy Cohen, played by Broadway veteran Peter Gallagher, sang to his wife.
</li><li> In the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>, the characters go to an ice rink on Michael's birthday so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveCarell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveCarell">Steve Carell</a>, a former hockey player and great skater, can show his skills off. Averted in the same episode when Jenna Fischer, who learned to skate for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladesOfGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladesOfGlory">Blades of Glory</a></em>, played Pam as being poor at it.
<ul><li> Also used in-universe in Michael's self-made movie <em>Threat Level Midnight</em>, which includes a completely irrelevant hockey subplot seemingly just to show off Michael's skill at it.
</li><li> Also, Andy, played by Ed Helms, gets many chances to sing to show off Ed Helms' talent.
<ul><li> And play the banjo. Rainn Wilson frequently picks up the guitar&mdash;Dwight and Andy played "Duelling Banjos" in one episode.

<ul><li> A 1976 episode had the gang from the apartment building staging a musical show for some senior citizens. It was highlighted by Valerie Bertinelli and Mackenzie Phillips as Elton John and Kiki Dee performing "Don't Go Breaking My Heart".
</li><li> They performed a second show at the same retirement home in a later season. Notable for Nanette Fabray, who played Bonnie Franklin's grandmother, performing the song "Triplets", which she originally performed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBandWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBandWagon">The Band Wagon</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredAstaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredAstaire">Fred Astaire</a>.

He also wrote one of Andy's songs. Nick Offerman, who plays Ron Swanson, really is an accomplished woodworker and a saxophone player.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlayboyClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePlayboyClub">The Playboy Club</a></em> only aired, like, 3 episodes, but every single one of them featured at least one song for Laura Benanti to sing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Power Rangers Zeo</a></em> had an episode where Tommy and Tanya had to sing every single line, briefly turning the show into a musical and displaying their singing talents (or lack of in Tommy's case). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin</a></em> also had an episode in season 3 where Kimberly sings an original song, playing her own acoustic guitar as backup. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Dino Thunder</a></em> would pull a similar trick with Yellow Ranger Kira, but as a singer with her own band who dreamed of getting a record contract one day, Kira performed significantly more often in-show than Kimberly ever did.
<ul><li> In <em>Dino Thunder</em>, Tommy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank">Jason David Frank</a>'s martial arts skills returned. He seldom used a stunt double. In an episode where Tommy dreamed fights with his first three ranger forms, that stuntman was in those suits instead.
</li><li> Also, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersNinjaStorm">Power Rangers Ninja Storm</a></em> and Dustin's mad motorcycle and saxophone skills. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">And</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">others</a>.
</li><li> And let's not forget that the original series tailored its martial arts battle to cater to each person's ability, Trini's kung fu, Jason's martial arts ability, Zack's dancing, and Kimberly's gymnastics. Billy didn't get to really show off until about season 3.
</li><li> Besides MMPR actors, a number of other actors in the series have showcased their martial arts talents, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Michael Chaturantabut</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSouthworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSouthworth">Daniel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Southworth</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge">Yoshi Sudarso and Brennan Mejia</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Wentworth Miller was a competitive swimmer in school, apparently the only reason he's swimming on a first-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em>. Not to mention playing a swimmer in a second season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>.
</li><li> Lucy Hale got two opportunities to show off her singing voice during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Privileged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Privileged">Privileged</a></em>: The first was a rehearsal scene where Rose and Sage were trying to impress their new publicist and the second was in the final episode, during Marco's marriage ceremony. She's also had a few chances to sing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em>.
</li><li> Staying with Rosewood, Janel Parrish also got to show off her voice.
</li><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> we got to see Dul&eacute; Hill's tap dancing skills. Later, in a blooper scene for another episode, when he comments that he has NO idea what he's talking about because he didn't take shop in high school, somebody off-screen asks if he was "too busy tap dancing". <a class="urllink" href="http://www.usanetwork.com/psych/videos/psych-out-all-tapped-out">(Yes, he was.)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<ul><li> Also High Top Fade Out in which Gus is reunited with 1/2 of his college quartet. Dul&eacute; and James show off their singing skills.
</li><li> In many episode "Psych-out"s the cast assembles for a song. Season 7 will have an episode titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalEpisode">Psych: The Musical</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em> has Broadway performers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinChenoweth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristinChenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a> (Galinda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>) and Ellen Greene (Audrey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors">Little Shop of Horrors</a></em>) among its ranks. The writers couldn't seem to make it through the second episode of the series without showing us that yes, Kristin Chenoweth can sing, though it took as long as the <em>fourth</em> episode for Chenoweth and Greene to have a duet (they sang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Flood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Flood">"Birdhouse in Your Soul"</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a>). Some things are just too good to pass up, it seems.
</li><li> The nature of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> allowed the series to exploit star Scott Bakula's various talents, frequently in instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">Suddenly Always Knew That</a>. Bakula's character Sam Beckett frequently found himself leaping into dancers and musicians to justify the inclusion of scenes in which Sam then had to dance, sing, or play the piano. In the penultimate episode ("Memphis Melody") he leaped into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis freaking Presley</a>, although the ultimate example has to be "Catch A Falling Star," in which he leaps into the understudy for the lead role of a production of <em>Man Of La Mancha</em>! Even when the leapee of the episode <em>isn't</em> a musician or dancer, episodes like "Double Identity" and "Pool Hall Blues" still throw in musical interludes purely in order to showcase Bakula's musical chops.
<ul><li> Donald Bellisario said that unless it was dangerous Bakula would rarely use a double for anything.
</li><li> However the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach">less said about Dean Stockwell's rapping</a> in "Shock Theatre" the better. (It's telling that the version on the soundtrack album is very different, both in terms of performance and words, to the one in the actual episode.)
<ul><li> This has happened with Bakula again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISNewOrleans">NCIS: New Orleans</a></em>. His character, Dwayne Pride, is frequently seen playing the piano at his bar.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> had a few examples, given that most of the cast were not "legit" actors at the start of the series. The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> has to be the "Tongue-Tied" music video at the beginning of the second-season finale as performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyJohnJules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyJohnJules">Danny John-Jules</a> (who was a professional dancer), but there were several episodes where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisBarrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisBarrie">Chris Barrie</a> (an impressionist and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpittingImage">Spitting Image</a></em> alumnus) would either do a voice-only part or have Rimmer break into a surprisingly excellent impression of a particular voice or accent (and of course, Ace Rimmer has a different-sounding voice to Rimmer as well).
<ul><li> Subverted in one episode, though, where apparently it turns out that Ace's voice is the one voice that Rimmer <em>can't</em> do well, sounding "67% more weaselly" according to Kryten.
</li><li> The audiobook of "Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers" is performed by Chris Barrie alone, but sounds like a full cast recording. Barrie also does this on an unbroadcast script episode ("Identity Within") that was included in the Series VII DVD as an extra.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rentaghost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rentaghost">Rentaghost</a></em>, cast showoff Michael Staniforth as Timothy Claypole could juggle (not unlikely for a court jester), tumble (ditto) and disco-dance on roller skates. He also wrote and sang the theme tune.
</li><li> In the season two premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell">Roswell</a></em>, the now ex-Sheriff Valenti (William Sadler) starts to sing at the Crashdown Cafe; his son Nick expects to be embarrassed. Both he and we are surprised to find his dad can actually sing pretty well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RumpoleOfTheBailey">Rumpole of the Bailey</a></em>, Julian Curry&mdash;an amateur wine expert and wine populariser&mdash;occasionally got to show off his wine knowledge whenever his character, Claude Erskine-Brown, went off about wine. Curry's help was apparently invaluable in the writing of the episode "Rumpole and the Blind Tasting" (which centered on recieving stolen property case where the allegedly stolen goods were a massive shipment of very expensive wine).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Runaways2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Runaways2017">Runaways (2017)</a></em>, Ariela Barer (Gertrude) shows off her singing <em>and</em> songwriting skills by singing a little lullaby she wrote. The Minoru family were initially an aversion. Even though all three actors are black belts, they weren't given a chance to show off their skills in the first season because the writers didn't want them to come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAsiansKnowMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAsiansKnowMartialArts">sterotypical</a>. But in the second season, they're able to showcase their talents in an impressive fight scene in the season finale.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> set in when, in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RutlandWeekendTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RutlandWeekendTelevision">Rutland Weekend Television</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBattley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBattley">David Battley</a> (as a cop) chased the actors away because 'This is a fire lane. You can't act here,' and then pulled some unidentifiable fruit out of his jacket, beginning to show off some very good juggling as the credits rolled.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGoodman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGoodman">John Goodman</a> is an adept impressionist, as seen in his many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> hostings, so <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> frequently had Dan launch into one-line impressions or whole routines as anybody from De Niro and Brando to all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">Three Stooges</a> or even Julia Child.

</li><li> Scrubs had a musical episode too. Not all the cast were good singers (hence why Chalke wasn't a part of the brief musical number they had in season 2), but some were and the rest gamely did their best toward an enthusiastic and entertaining performance overall.

<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a></em> seemed to intentionally avert this trope in the casting of Mikhail Baryshnikov (as Aleksandr Petrovsky, or "The Russian"). Baryshnikov is frequently cited as one of the greatest ballet dancers of the age, yet never once is his character given an opportunity to dance. In fact, in the one scene most likely to feature him dancing, it's quickly cut off before he takes his first steps.
<ul><li> He does run for a taxi at one point with balletic skips and hops, though.

</li><li> Chosen Man Hagman from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em> series is often seen singing or playing music. John Tams who plays Hagman is also a folk musician and composer. He also co-authored music score for the series.

<ul><li> This was used to expose Rembrandt as a fraud in one world - that world version is royalty, and tone-deaf.
</li></ul></li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmallWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmallWonder">Small Wonder</a></em> allowed Marla Pennington to demonstrate her culinary skills or, more often, Tiffany Brissette to show off <em>her</em> talents, from gymnastics to voice mimicry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonnyWithAChance">Sonny with a Chance</a></em> started off having Sonny (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a>) as a comedy actress, not a musician (although from the very first episode and opening credits it's seen she's got a guitar). That, until a second season episode where she shows she sings, plays the piano and writes music (like Demi Lovato herself). Probably justified, seeing as how it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> show, and Disney loves to promote its stars as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singers</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSopranosS3E13ArmyOfOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSopranosS3E13ArmyOfOne">Army of One</a>" had Junior Soprano, played by Dominic Chianese, singing an Italian ballad; Chianese is an accomplished tenor in real life. This is something of a subversion; while the adult characters are enjoying it, their kids are bored out of their minds. Meadow Soprano even starts heckling, and later describes the song as saccharine and cliche.

The original plan was to shoot it in stages, until the director found out that the actor, Corin Nemec, is an extremely good swimmer. The entire scene is filmed as a single shot lasting just under two minutes, and actor performs various physical activities while holding his breath underwater. When he finally surfaces, he's barely out of breath. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>, the director still can't get over his surprise at the actor not needing to resurface for air.

According to Luttrell's audio commentary on the episode, she had to fly to LA to do the singing twice since her first attempt sounded too much like a classically trained singer (I wonder why?) which the character, Teyla, is not.

<ul><li> The show even went so far as to have a whole episode with a plot based around the Doctor's singing, in which he becomes a celebrity to a race of aliens that have never heard music before. (Ironically, that episode - "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS6E13Virtuoso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekVoyagerS6E13Virtuoso">Virtuoso</a>" - features the only use of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalentDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalentDouble">Talent Double</a> for the Doctor's singing - operatic tenor Agostino Castellano dubbed over Robert Picardo for <em>Don Carlo</em> and <em>Rondine Al Nido</em> (all other songs in the episode are performed by Picardo).

<ul><li> Vanessa Williams actually sang "The Way We Were" in Season 1 while reminiscing over her time with Marc. However, this was only in voice-over.

It annoys Danny to no end, however.

Kristen Bell did all her own singing, which is probably half the reason the scene was written in the first place. (The other half: it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">karaoke</a></em>. The show's creator, however, mused on the prevalence of musical episodes in shows at the time, that since she was the <em>only</em> cast member who could sing...)

<ul><li> This would also apply to Leon Thomas' skills as a musician and singer.
</li><li> This occasionally applies to Ariana Grande and Elizabeth Gillies, both of whom are singers, having previously appeared on Broadway.
</li><li> Elizabeth Gillies also gets numerous chances to show off her talents as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices">Woman Of A Thousand Voices</a>, with numerous scenes involving her character doing funny voices (a deep, Jersey-accented "man" voice, a Judy Garland-esque voice to mock Tori, and even a pitch-perfect imitation of Ariana Grande's voice, among others).
</li></ul></li><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheState">The State</a></em> spinoff <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VivaVariety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VivaVariety">Viva Variety</a></em>, the musical guest was Cake Like, co-host Kerri Kenney's band. This involved her introducing the band in character, then switching costumes and singing a song as herself.
</li><li> In some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>, Artie Nielsen sits down at a piano. In "Regrets," he plays a piece that he's written for his father. The piece, "Nocturne for Artie's Dad," was composed and performed by Saul Rubinek himself.

Also, possibly, Rob Lowe's impression of Martin Sheen a few seasons later.
<ul><li> Except that the Jackal lip-sync was <em>totally</em> in character for CJ, adds to rather than stop the episode's flow, and is universally adored by <em>West Wing</em> fans.
</li></ul></li><li> In the short-lived <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatAboutJoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatAboutJoan">What About Joan</a>,</em> cast member and noted Broadway star Donna Murphy was given several uncalled-for singing scenes.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsHappening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsHappening">What's Happening!!</a>,</em> Fred Berry was an accomplished disco dancer and was previously a member of a dance group known as The Lockers. Naturally, his character Rerun had a few opportunities to show off his dance moves.

She's also a pretty good singer, as seen on a series of Christmas Week episodes in 1996 where she promoted her Christmas album. She crochets, too.
<ul><li> Host Pat Sajak subverted this on a Christmas episode in 1988, where he gave an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">intentionally off-key</a> rendition of "White Christmas" while Vanna accompanied him on a piano.
</li><li> He later played it straight in December 1994, singing the theme to the 1950s <em>Zorro</em> TV series after a contestant failed to solve the bonus puzzle ZORRO.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode 'Plan B' of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> in which Alex puts together a band seems to exist solely to let Selena Gomez show off her singing skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em> had two moments that stand out: An episode where Jack challenged Will's boss Ben to a tap-dance-off to prove he was better at something, with the <em>real</em> reason being to display Gregory Hines and his dancing abilities. Then there was the finale, which had Jack and Karen performing a duet of "Unforgettable," with no excuse given other than "I feel a song coming on."
<ul><li> As the show got in to its final two or three seasons the writers took every opportunity to showcase Megan Mullally (As Karen)'s singing voice, towards the end of the show they stopped even trying to be subtle about it.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em> called "Amazon Hot Wax". Going undercover to stop extortionists in the record industry gives Diana Prince a chance to show off her vocal abilities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaCarter">Lynda Carter</a> performs songs from her debut album <em>Portrait</em> as a form of advertisement.
</li><li> Adam DeVine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Workaholics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Workaholics">Workaholics</a></em> has displayed his impressive voice several times, most notably in the episodes 'Office Campout' and 'Man Up'. The show also makes reference to Anders Holm's collegiate swimming days, though this hasn't yet been displayed on the show.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstYearOfMyLifeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstYearOfMyLifeAgain">The Worst Year of My Life, Again</a></em>, Laurence Boxhall has two dancing scenes in the episode "Sam's Party".
</li><li> In a couple <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> episodes, David Duchovny shows off his basketball skills. He played junior varsity at Princeton.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101">Zoey 101</a></em>: Michael's girlfriend Lisa gets to sing a Open Mic Night. which she does very well, as she was played by former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> contestant Lisa Tucker.
</li><li> Virtually every time a wrestler stars or guest-stars in <em>anything</em> they're shown using wrestling moves, even if they're not supposed to. This led to a hilarious subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> when they introduce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> as an enemy agent and expert at close-quarters combat, but is revealed to be a <em>sword expert</em> who ends up performing no wrestling moves whatsoever.
<ul><li> Completely averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a>' guest spot on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>; he plays an ex-football player (in a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>), but never does any wrestling moves.
</li><li> One particularly blatant example comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. In one episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne Johnson</a> (credited simply as "The Rock") appears for one scene just so he can wrestle Seven of Nine. They even let him do a couple of his trademark moves (including The People's Eyebrow). The Eyebrow can, at least, be justified by the fact that he is playing a gladiator. It would make sense for him to have a trademark, of sorts.
</li></ul></li><li> While he doesn't do it in his film work, inevitably every single character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a> plays on television will be shown cooking. This is because Patinkin is a huge foodie and a self-trained chef and loves to cook as much as he loves to eat.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadLikeMe">Dead Like Me</a></em> where he demonstrates the difference in skills needed to be a home chef and a professional chef was originally supposed to show Rube's cooking skill, but Patinkin insisted the script be changed to reflect the fact that most "home chefs" couldn't last an hour in a real industrial kitchen.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 1950s <em>Zorro</em>, Henry Calvin, who plays the slovenly and inept Sgt. Garcia gets to show off his rich baritone several times in the show's run, usually traditional ballads or drinking songs.

</li><li> In the original production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ShowBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ShowBoat">Show Boat</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElevenOClockNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElevenOClockNumber">The Eleven O'Clock Number</a> included a bit where Kim did imitations of Ethel Barrymore or Ted Lewis or whatever contemporary stars the audience requested, for no good reason other than allowing featured actress Norma Terris to show off. When Terris was replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IreneDunne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IreneDunne">Irene Dunne</a>, the imitations were cut, and the otherwise ultra-complete 1987 recording didn't try to recreate them.

</li><li> Odette Myrtil made her career in musicals written to show off her abilities as singer <em>and</em> as a violinist.

</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Once" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Once">Once</a></em> is a notable example because <em>there is no orchestra</em>.

</li><li> Typically, productions of <em>On the Town</em> cast professional ballerinas as Ivy, since she does a lot of complicated ballet dances.

<ul><li> The song "Show-Off" may serve as an in-universe-in-universe example: in the show within a show, Janet is a famous actress and notable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>. Thus, even her declaration that she's giving up the stage requires a 5 minute, elaborate musical number that showcases her many, many talents. The irony does not escape the others present.

<ul><li> He also does this for the actors in his works: once he knew he had Daveed Diggs and Ren&eacute;e Elise Goldsberry as Lafayette/Jefferson and Angelica Schuyler, he went ahead and wrote "Guns and Ships" and "Satisfied", which feature some of the fastest sung lyrics on Broadway, simply because he knew Diggs and Goldsberry would be capable of performing the songs (although, as Diggs pointed out in an interview, they don't even touch the fastest songs in Hip Hop). Lin also noted that he looks forward to the day where high-school age actresses perform "Satisfied" in high school productions, simply because he wants to see if they're capable.

Brian and Stewie begin to sing, but Mort cuts the song short, yelling at them to shut up and just get in the time machine.
<ul><li> The episode <em>Spies Reminiscent of Us</em> may well have been written as an opportunity for Mila Kunis to speak in her native Russian.

</li></ul></li><li> Susie Carmichael had a few songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em> (and even a few in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> timeline). Her voice actress Cree Summer had made a few records and lyrics herself.
</li><li> Showing off Cree's singing voice isn't just limited to the <em>Rugrats</em> franchise. She appears to get at least one chance to sing in most of her roles as of late, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>, and most prominently, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> (although to be fair, her character in that show, Foxxy Love, is supposed to be a <em>musician</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Total Drama Action</em> episode "The Princess Pride" features a song performed by Courtney, whose voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilieClaireBarlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilieClaireBarlow">Emilie-Claire Barlow</a> is an accomplished jazz singer.
</li><li> <em>Total Drama World Tour</em> is a showcase for the singing talents of the rest of the show's cast.
</li></ul></li><li> Olivia Olson has had two characters geared to this: Vanessa Doofenshmirtz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> (which fits in quite well since there's a song every episode anyway), and Marceline the Vampire Queen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, Prince Gumball&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderSwap">the male version of Princess Bubblegum</a>&mdash;is voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris">Neil Patrick Harris</a>, so it's understandable that a musical number was fit in.
</li><li> Banana Man, who is voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAl">Weird Al</a>, also got to do a short musical number in his second appearance. This is in contrast with Banana Man's first appearance, where he said almost nothing at all.
</li></ul></li><li> It's been suggested but never proven that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> has an understanding that he gets to sing at least once during each of his Sideshow Bob appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>.
<ul><li> Yeardley Smith gets to show off her beautiful singing voice in several episodes, as well as several albums. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> has as well, with Homer having been a barbershop singer, a rock singer and an opera singer
</li></ul></li><li> The two female leads on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> get to show off singing talents: Velma at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheLegendOfTheVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheLegendOfTheVampire">Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire</a>,</em> Daphne in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> episode "In Fear of the Phantom".
<ul><li> Velma's singing voice in ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheLegendOfTheVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheLegendOfTheVampire">Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire</a>" was Krystal Harris while Nicole Jaffe reprised Velma's speaking voice.
</li><li> Daphne played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a> sings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em>, and has a duet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMusicOfTheVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMusicOfTheVampire">Scooby-Doo! Music of the Vampire</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the DVD commentaries, the writers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> shamelessly admitted that they tried to get Jon Lovitz to sing any chance they got, noting that he has a very powerful singing voice.
</li><li> A couple examples on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted with Desir&eacute;e Goyette, who performed many songs on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials">animated TV specials</a> before becoming the voice of Nermal on <em>Garfield and Friends</em> (a role which saw her singing on multiple occasions).
</li><li> <em>Garfield and Friends</em> had many musical segments with Garfield and Jon, showing that both Lorenzo Music and Thom Huge had pretty good singing voices. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em> segments also gave many musical segments which allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreggBerger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreggBerger">Gregg Berger</a> to sing in-character as Orson.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffBennett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffBennett">Jeff Bennett</a> gets to show off a rather impressive singing voice on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em>, when Kowalski sings to the other penguins about a bus called Graveyard Eight.
<ul><li> Bennett also got to sing when he was voicing The Cowlorado Kid on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WildWestCowboysOfMooMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WildWestCowboysOfMooMesa">Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of the later episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em> had song and dance numbers, once again, to show off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonAlexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonAlexander">Jason Alexander</a>'s singing voice.
</li><li> An aversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers</a></em>: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>, Mandell admits that he really wished he wrote an excuse for Zach (played by Jerry Orbach) to sing. He <em>did</em> manage it with Laura Dean (Niko) in "The Ax," though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>
<ul><li> Most of the cast have voice doubles for songs, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AshleighBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AshleighBall">Ashleigh Ball</a> does the singing voice for both of her characters. It's not a coincidence that she happens to be the lead singer for band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeyOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeyOcean">Hey Ocean!</a>.
</li><li> Similarly Apple Bloom has never been written as having any singing talent, but when it was discovered that her actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleCreber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleCreber">Michelle Creber</a> had a great voice she was assigned as the singing double for her best friend Sweetie Belle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreaLibman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndreaLibman">Andrea Libman</a> voices Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy and is Fluttershy's singing voice. She is also fluent in French; a fact noted by fans upon hearing Fluttershy pronounce "haute couture".
</li><li> In an ironic reversal, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EquestriaGirls">Equestria Girls</a></em> seems to be intent on showing off the acting talents of the singing doubles, Rebecca Shoichet (Singing voice for Twilight Sparkle) and Kazumi Evans (Singing voice for Rarity and Princess Luna) have both gotten major roles.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire cast on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KipoAndTheAgeOfWonderbeasts">Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts</a></em> got a chance to sing, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenFukuhara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenFukuhara">Karen Fukuhara</a> got to sing!
</li><li> Thanks to having a song at the end of almost every episode (and a few songs within episodes) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone">ChalkZone</a></em>, E.G. Daily was able to show off her singing voice as Rudy. She's released a few records and lyrics herself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot">My Life as a Teenage Robot</a>,</em> Jenny has software that renders her an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omniglot">Omniglot</a>. However, she's only seen speaking English and Japanese, because her voice actress, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaniceKawaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaniceKawaye">Janice Kawaye</a>, can speak Japanese <em>really</em> well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em>, the Rita &amp; Runt segments usually provided an excuse for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernadettePeters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernadettePeters">Bernadette Peters</a> to sing. Many of the most beloved episodes also featured at least one of the Warners singing a song, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobPaulsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobPaulsen">Rob Paulsen</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessHarnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessHarnell">Jess Harnell</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TressMacNeille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TressMacNeille">Tress MacNeille</a> all happen to be good singers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDimaggio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDimaggio">John Dimaggio</a> is known for his beatboxing skills, something which pops up from time to time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>. Some particular examples include Fry's 20th century friend Noticeably F.A.T. from "Luck of the Fryrish", Robot Santa Claus beatboxing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey">Kwanzaabot</a>'s rap as part of the musical number "This Trinity's Going to War" from "Bender's Big Score", and the beatbox version of the theme song used during the intros for "Spanish Fry" and "Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television" with Billy West's vocals added for a good measure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>. Creator Rebecca Sugar deliberately made sure that everyone cast for the show had some singing talent. The biggest examples of this trope would be "Stronger Than You" to make use of R&amp;B singer Estelle, and "It's Over, Isn't It" to compliment Deedee Magno's Broadway experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelRising">Marvel Rising</a></em>: Gwen is a drummer in a band, the same as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">her comics</a>. Unlike comics Gwen, however, the <em>Marvel Rising</em> version is also a singer, since her voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoveCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoveCameron">Dove Cameron</a> is as well. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelRisingBattleOfTheBands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelRisingBattleOfTheBands">Battle of the Bands</a></em> has her perform "Born Ready", a song sung by Dove Cameron which had appeared in previous <em>Marvel Rising</em> animations, such as as the credits song in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelRisingSecretWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarvelRisingSecretWarriors">Secret Warriors</a></em>.
