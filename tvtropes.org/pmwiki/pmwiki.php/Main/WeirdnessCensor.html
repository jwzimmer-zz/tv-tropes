<ul><li> Became a running joke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em>, in which one woman is constantly harassed by Sideburn &mdash; who is trying to get jiggy with her car. By narrative convenience, she starts being in range of the giant robot battles nearly every episode.
</li><li> In contrast, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> has maybe five people actually see the constant robot battles. This is partially justified as apparently all but a few of the Mini-Con panels appear in unpopulated areas, but still.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>: No matter how pyrotechnic the magic, the antics of the goddesses and demons never draw the police (or possibly the Army). Not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">humongous monsters</a> like Garm. This was explained in the manga as the townspeople being desensitized to weirdness due to the neighborhood kids pulling off epic level pranks on a regular basis, or some similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>.
<ul><li> They <em>do</em> live in the same town as a technical engineering college. If those people get bored enough, they can disassemble your car and then reassemble it. Inside your living room.
<ul><li> Shown in action in one occasion: when Marller transformed the college in a castle due a wish from Sayoko, <em>even the students who weren't in when she did it</em> decided it was a prank, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">left to not get involved with the mess</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Amazingly enough, the fire brigade actually turned up in one of the latest manga chapters. They ended up thinking it was a false alarm though, as all the damage had already been fixed with supernatural means.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BludgeoningAngelDokuroChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BludgeoningAngelDokuroChan">Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this in the first episode. She introduces herself to the class as an angel (after turning a classmate into a monkey and making another one completely vanish) despite Sakura's insistence that she keep it a secret, but they just nod and accept it fully. In fact, Sakura is the only one who seems the slightest bit weirded out by the situation. "This should really bother you! Say 'Ahh! Angels exist?!' or something!"
</li><li> The citizens of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> universe seem to quickly get over the fact that several towns and cities suddenly explode when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> comes by.
<ul><li> King Piccolo nuked a city live on television and everyone knew he was more than capable of destroying West City when he made his announcement. There was also his son who destroyed the island where the Martial Arts Tournament is held, canceling the event for a number of years.
</li><li> Nappa destroys several cities before military forces finally are sent out to stop him, to no avail. For whatever reason, the fact that he can blow up huge urban areas and shoot energy from his hand doesn't factor into their attempt at fighting back.
</li><li> Perhaps the most blatant example of this was how the entire world became convinced that Cell was just a monster and chi attacks were just special effects. This despite the fact that not two decades earlier one of those special effects <em>blew up the moon on global television</em>.
</li><li> The military also goes up against Majin Buu, before sending in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Mr. Satan</a>. Despite everything that has happened on a global scale for close to two decades, he initially refuses to believe in flight, chi attacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">nigh-indestructible super beings</a>, or robots from the future. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">But doesn't seem to have much trouble accepting aliens.</a>
</li><li> There is also the fact that the citizens on Earth are happy to go back to their everyday lives after only briefly wondering if they were killed by Majin Buu and their cities destroyed. Then again, since this is Dragon Ball, maybe mass revivals became so common that not even the muggles care anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a> SuperS</em>, a gigantic evil circus tent appears right in the middle of Tokyo, in obvious plain view. Among the other random massive evil fortresses and demonic whatnots that show up in the middle of that same city in other seasons. Part of what makes this one stand out in the show is a lack of this problem in most cases: the evil base in the first season was underground in Antarctica, the base in the second season was on a distant planet in the far future, the base in the third season is a covert underground lab, and in the fifth it appears to be located in another dimension. The circus thing was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">the Lemures</a> immediately after its appearance - they mocked the citizens for not noticing it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em> nobody seems to care that students attack each other's high schools and commit openly visible acts of extreme violence. You'd at least expect that the police would try to intervene - or that the army would be called in to do something about the genocide that's taking place.
<ul><li> In the manga a doctor commented in it being more or less a bunch of delinquents beating each-other to death. He seems to be the only one that has noticed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WindyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WindyTales">Windy Tales</a></em>, almost nobody notices the huge amounts of cats that <em>fly around</em> on air streams, not even when they're cluttered together in a huge ball consisting of dozens of them during a typhoon.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, the typical townsperson (and the majority of the main cast in the beginning) doesn't question any of the "odder" stuff that goes on in Kinkan, including ballerina-dancing Anteaters (and other anthropomorphic animals). Even visitors to the town are affected&mdash;one women wonders if her troupe leader used to be an electric eel before arriving to the town, then quickly brushes it off. Later on in the series, it's revealed that it's because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the story magically controlling the town and the people inside of it</span>. The only people that ever seem to realize something's off with the town are either important to the story, or actively go <em>looking</em> for something odd in the town.
</li><li> Nobody seems to notice their friends strange behavior and obvious paranoia, or at least do anything about it, in the answer arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This trope is subverted in Tatarigoroshi-hen, or actually <em>any</em> arc where they try to save Satoko. In Tataragiroshi-hen in particular, Rena and Mion notice Keiichi's paranoia, unlike Onikakushi-hen, and try to cover his actions up.</span>
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> Battler uses it to deny that the Beato/Virgilia battle happened <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even better example in ep 5, after being defeated by Battler on the game board, Erika suddenly stands up in her chair during the meal and starts talking in blue truth and exclaims to her master Bernkastel that she has won and has to be acknowledged. Then she suddenly sits down in her chair eating. The family collectively thinks they were hallucinating</span>.

It was later revealed that mages keep their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> protected by spells put in place to heighten people's ability to disbelieve information (they also rely on people's inherent ability to doubt). This naturally makes for interesting situations whenever the very odd is shown.

Asakura runs head first into it when she and Sayo try to follow Negi, and describes it as a sudden desire <em>not</em> to go into the area protected by it (Sayo, as a Ghost, is unaffected). Once she's noticed the effect, she can resist it, but is physically straining to do so the further in she goes.
</li><li> In chapter 301, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Natsumi Murakami's pactio artifact weaponizes this trope, rendering anyone holding hands with her unnoticeable. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Fate Averruncus</a> himself acknowledges it as a rare and dangerous artifact for the enemy to have</span>.
</li><li> It also seems to apply to more than just magic. For example, Negi (a mage) is completely oblivious to the <em>extremely obviously robotic</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> in his class. Chisame is the only one who seems to completely lack a weirdness censor.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutatsuNoSpica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutatsuNoSpica">Futatsu no Spica</a></em>, nobody wonders about the weird stuff that sometimes happens involving Lion-san, for example when Asumi gets twirled around at the playground by some unseen force.
<ul><li> Usually this is the case, including people it's happening to, like Kasane on the merry-go-round. There is one little girl that comments on sake flying through the air, which gets her grandfather scolded for giving alcohol to the kids.
</li></ul></li><li> In Chapter 12 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> manga, a group of tourists witness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Alucard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Alucard">Alucard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Anderson</a> preparing to fight to the death, and dismiss them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">performance artists</a>. You could say it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>, since they were inside a museum when that happened.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, any fighting done in the mortal realm is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">invisible to most of the human population</a>, but despite that there are a few things that still should stick out. Whenever a human who can see spirits addresses one of them it looks like they're talking to thin air to a normal bystander. When a human turns into a Shinigami their spirit leaves their body, while most Shinigami compensate and have a temporary soul inhabit their body, Ichigo tends to just leave his body lying around out in the open. Nobody at all ever seems to notice either of these events until the first movie, which is roughly 100 episodes into the continuity, and it's hardly mentioned again, if ever at all.
<ul><li> Somewhat explained with all the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashing">Brainwashing</a> the Shinigami pull off. Also, there's another "substitute soul-reaper" there, as well as is reasonable to think the Technological Department, considering Karakura-town (or whatever) is the set of many, MANY altercations, may have devised something to make the townspeople unaware to what's going on under their noses. Even Ichigo was close to having his memories removed, Orihime had the process applied on her, Ichigo's sisters etc. At this level, It's surprising more of the characters don't die of brain cancer...
</li><li> Averted when they handle Ichigo leaving his body lying around in one of the movies. Exactly as Rukia said would happen, someone found his body and some paramedics were trying to restart his heart.
</li><li> Although, there are occasions where the fights actually caused damage to nearby structures, which is hardly ever mentioned. The only times it's mentioned is in the first episode, where a Hollow breaks the glass on a nearby building, (only Ichigo can see what did it). Also when Shinji fights Grimmjow, he mentions that their fight is breaking the roofs of houses and asks him to be more careful.
</li><li> It's implied by Yumichika that Soul Society actually factors in this sort of damage into their missions- when the battle against Grimmjow's Fraccion seems to be getting more heated than expected, he calls up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> telling them to set a 'spatial freeze' around the battling shinigami and add repairs to the mission budget.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. In order for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> to be sustained, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">a number of details that the cast is forcibly required to ignore</a>, otherwise the whole charade would fall apart rather quickly. With time, most of these have been either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> to death or even seriously acknowledged by the cast.
</li><li> Used maybe as irony in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: "You will disregard any strange events." The geassed people usually reply if they're asked why they're not doing anything about a crisis situation, or even reassure themselves, or warn the watcher that they are geassed with the line "I see nothing out of the ordinary."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata">Uta Kata</a></em> nobody wonders about the tsunami that threatens Kamakura out of the blue, or about the fact that it is deflected by a flying, screaming young girl.
</li><li> In the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pretear">Pr&eacute;tear</a></em>, Shin's spell Beyondios creates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone">dimensional zone</a> wherein the Leafe Knights can fight Demon Larvae without destroying nearby real estate. Obviously this is impossible to do when Shin isn't around, or when the monsters can't be placed under the shield for whatever reasons &mdash; but they <em>still</em> manage to stay unnoticed even by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">protagonist's</a> family, who only become aware that <em>something is going on</em> when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> invades their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>. And <em>then</em>, it takes awhile for them to notice. There are at least a few episodes in which they go on a "ghost hunt".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus">Venus Versus Virus</a></em>, only a few people can see a Virus. Not only that, the Virus likes to attack people who are able to see it.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveIsInTheBag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveIsInTheBag">Love Is in the Bag</a></em>, where everyone except the London transfer students know about Kate turning into a bag.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mononoke">Mononoke</a></em> almost no one takes notice of the Medicine Seller's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialMarkings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialMarkings">Facial Markings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteLittleFangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteLittleFangs">Cute Little Fangs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointedEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointedEars">Pointed Ears</a>. Only once does anyone remark upon his unusual clothing. Usually, the most anyone notices about him is that he's very attractive.
<ul><li> This is especially obvious in the Zashiki-Warashi arc, which features a blonde, blue-eyed woman in Feudal Japan, something the other characters are astonished by when she first removes the cloth over her hair. These same characters have just met and interacted with the Medicine Seller, who has almost white hair and blue eyes, without comment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em> has a girl whose special ability is Dummy Check. It makes her invisible to the naked eye but not to cameras. Apparently she can also use it as a Weirdness Censor in order to avoid drawing attention to herself (mainly due to her massive eyebrows).
</li><li> Much of the humor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> stems from the fact that the author took all the usual components of sci-fi superhero series, reached over to switch labeled "Weirdness Censor" and flipped it to "off." All of this is completely unknown to the main cast (except Tokiko, who lampshades it occasionally) who behave as flamboyantly as possible, fully believing that the Weirdness Censor is in full effect.
</li><li> This is often played for laughs in the typically bizarre world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. Particularly because the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, who is <em>literally</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">made of rubber</a>, and who has recruited a large cast of truly freaky characters into his crew, finds extremely random things to be weird. For example, he has a talking reindeer as his ship's doctor, but is shocked and baffled to meet a talking bear on another crew.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the yaoi manga <em>Sex Pistols</em>: any "Madararui talk" overheard by the "normal" humans is automatically and subconsciously discarded. The art plays it literal for laughs: inside the normal people thought-clouds, a paper with "Madararui talk" written on it is crushed into a ball and then thrown into a garbage bin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, this explains why normal people literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">cannot see supernatural creatures</a> of the less-antagonizing variety, as people only bother to remember what they can explain (or what's not trying to rape and eat them).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>
<ul><li> The title character, despite seeking anything weird or unusual in the world, manages to remain oblivious to the weird things that happen around her, aiding the other characters in keeping her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a>.
<ul><li> Haruhi provides an interesting take on this trope in that she not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">normal person</a> like Kyon is (who is who is very much in the know), nor just any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndexOfFictionalCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndexOfFictionalCreatures">common supernatural entity</a> either, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">The Omnipotent</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">shapes the universe to her whim</a>, and who may have possibly <em>created</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">aliens, time travelers, and espers</a> of the <em>Haruhi Suzumiya</em> universe. However, it is likely that her expectations and skepticism towards the supernatural may ironically prevent her from interacting with them despite her desire to do so (she desires secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">esper</a> organizations, so of course the esper organizations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">will be secret</a>). Her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> powers may likely be, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">and thankfully too</a>, effectively acting as her own weirdness censor.
</li></ul></li><li> Kuyou Suou / Suou Kuyou is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> who is just so...<em>off</em> that normal people don't even react to her presence. When some people (like Kyon) are forced to acknowledge her, they're creeped out by just how obviously yet subtly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">wrong</a></em> everything about her is.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu">Kamichu!</a></em> a middle school girl becomes a goddess. It's just another after school job as far as most of the townsfolk are concerned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie">Is This a Zombie?</a></em>, the heroes normally erase the memories of the normal people to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>. In the first episode of season 2, Ayumu is forced to fight a tentacled monster in broad daylight, yet everybody seems to only give it a passing glance and concentrate on the fact that Ayumu is in a dress. After defeating the monster, the device Ayumu uses to erase memories breaks down, leaving him a laughingstock as everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">brings up the crossdressing for a long, long time</a>. At the very least, Taeko noticed the monster and thanked him for saving her life.
</li><li> Weaponized and enforced by the villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em>, who by the end of the series are roaming the streets eating everyone they see - and deleting memories of anything being out of the ordinary from everyone who hasn't built up resistance to their power, ensuring that nobody but the heroes notice enough to avoid getting eaten or even panic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan">Haiyore! Nyarko-san</a></em>, the characters <em>do</em> try to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> from realizing that there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a> monsters in their town (with the title character erecting a "convenient barrier" to block out her battles) &mdash; but they don't bother hiding much else. Nyarko introduces herself at school as Nyarlathotep the Crawling Chaos and Mahiro's wife and nobody bats an eyelash. Cuko introduces <strong>her</strong>self as Nyarko's wife with nary a remark (except for Nyarko's friend remarking "You're pretty lucky!"). Nyarko's pet shantak-bird (which looks like a mix of hippopotamus, bird, and bat) does draw some brief commentary, but they just shrug it off.
</li><li> Most bystanders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> seem to be utterly oblivious to the actions that any of the dragons take; like when Tohru used inhuman strength and speed to stop a purse snatcher, or when she fired a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> in broad daylight that blew away storm clouds while in full dragon form. They do notice the horns, but everyone just passes that off as cosplaying. It's later explained as being caused by "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerceptionFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerceptionFilter">cognitive inhibition</a>" magic on part of the dragons.
<ul><li> During the Dodgeball chapter where Tohru and friend ended fighting each other and destroyed the park they're on, Lucoa stated that she'll restore the park and manipulate bystander memory to keep their identity secret.
</li><li> In chapter 38, Tohru also shows that she also capable to manipulate memories as she erase Clemene memories.
</li><li> In chapter 6 of <em>Lucoa is my xx</em>, Lucoa admits to Shouta that she cast a "Fuzzy Spell" on his entire class that makes them oblivious to what she does while still being aware that she's there. She proceeds to demonstrate its effects by parting the pool a la Moses to save a drowning student without anyone making a comment.

Mechazawa (the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinCanRobot">Tin-Can Robot</a>) in particular is especially odd in that not only do most people not even realize that he's a robot, but <em>Mechazawa himself</em> doesn't seem to realize it, either.

</li><li> Up until the "Gang War" storyline several years ago, the writers of DC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> so that he was still an urban myth not believed in by everyone in Gotham. An air of mystery around him is believable, or even confusion over what he is, but it was often taken too far. It's hard to explain away the thousands of criminals Batman has taken down, along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicHail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicHail">Bat Signal</a> shining up every night, the dozens of supervillains committing crimes just to get his attention, as well as numerous public appearances with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a>. And apparently, a guy like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is perfectly normal, but a guy dressed as a bat is ridiculous.

</li></ul></li><li> One appearance of The Abomination had him walking through a crowded street in the rain without being noticed. The Abomination is an eight-foot-tall musclebound reptilian monster. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision">Everyone else was staring at their feet</a> for fear of making eye-contact with a stranger. Even worse, there was a six-month period of time with him as a teacher of dramatic writing or something, and no one of his students or anyone else for that matter has anything to say of the 8-foot gravely voiced covered from head to feet guy except that "he looks sad" or something. Seriously, if the Hulk used a semi-decent suit he wouldn't attract any attention at all.
<ul><li> There was a period when the Gray Hulk worked in Vegas as an enforcer named "Mr. Fixit." People regarded him as just a huge guy. "Either he's part black and part Native American, or else he tans real weird." (It helped that everyone thought of the Hulk as green.)

Why a public that's already accepted the reality of superbeings, aliens and gods would have any trouble believing that New York was attacked by demons is another.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PropositionPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PropositionPlayer">Proposition Player</a></em>, the dispossessed gods Anubis and Moloch try to track down the protagonist in Las Vegas. Moloch suggests they conceal their appearances, but the jackal-headed Anubis doesn't bother since hey, it's <em>Las Vegas</em>.
</li><li> Fabletown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em> has a magical protection to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">mundies</a> from noticing their magical society in the middle of New York City. At one point they have to rely on rain to act instead, and in another point their filter (and the magic holding the buildings together) fails, forcing them to leave as New York discovers one of its neighborhoods is now suddenly in ruins for no discernible reason.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a></em>, magic is frequently explained away by "they must be shooting a movie." People still get out of Dr Strange's way, but they don't understand why (see Strange Tales vol. 1 #120 [May, 1964]). Amusingly, sometimes Doc and his associates have to chase down misbehaving magic, since the dragon/ogre/giant rabbit is something "even Greenwich Village would notice."
</li><li> In the first arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a></em> solo series, detective Dale Colton explains to Zatanna that people have a lot of trouble accepting the truth about magic, even though Zatanna herself is a world-famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMagician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMagician">Stage Magician</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiciansAreWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiciansAreWizards">actual magical powers</a> who is a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a>.

This is particularly frustrating, even to Zatanna herself, because here there is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, the supernatural world <em>wants</em> to be recognized, but the people are not listening. The alternate argument would be that in a world populated by aliens who can fly and shoot lasers out their eyes and gets invaded once a month, most people probably don't really see much difference between natural and supernatural as one could easily be used to mimic the other.

<ul><li> Occurs quite often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em>: Peter Parker jumps around, climbs up walls, shoots webs and <em>acknowledges</em> himself as Spider-Man when getting money off a man who runs the wrestling. He also beats the snot out of another student, <em>and nobody makes the connection.</em>
</li><li> The only time they could clearly see Peter Parker doing any of that stuff was the fight he got into. Other than that, you had some guy jumping on roofs once that someone might have seen at a distance or not, and Spider-Man in a worse costume doing wrestling. Maybe it would have been possible to get a hint of his identity by tracking clues through the wrestling establishment, but it wasn't evident from any other character's perspective these isolated incidents were tied together.
</li><li> He does get unmasked on the L train in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em>. But no one knows a name to go with the face, and they promise not to reveal his identity anyway since he saved their lives.

Each of these events had multiple witnesses who knew Peter, but nothing seems to come of them.
</li><li> Mentioned in the background material for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> films. Apparently (it's not well conveyed on-screen) as well as The Matrix's ability to revert an area and people's memories to remove an incident from history, the leads are supposed to have a "bubble effect" which prevents passers-by (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a>, if you will) from noticing them or interacting with them unless they do something dramatic (like stealing their phone).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></em> films use this as an excuse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII">the sequel</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaunOfTheDead">Shaun of the Dead</a></em>, Shaun goes a whole day and into the next morning without noticing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> that has already started. This is part of his characterization that he's trudging through his life like a zombie.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTrumanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTrumanShow">The Truman Show</a></em>, this explains why Truman takes so long realizing that his world is fake. "We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented." It also explains why all the people around him studiously ignore Truman when he starts to act out. They ignore Truman's antics because that's what they are <em>paid to do</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em>: Admiral Boom fires a cannon twice a day so regularly you can set your clock by it, which results in tremors akin to an earthquake for any nearby houses, including the Banks residence. However, they're so used to it at the time of the film that it barely fazes them; they just take their posts to make sure that no valuables are broken, then go back to whatever they were doing before.
<ul><li> A minor example with the eponymous character; Mary doesn't generally let people see her magic (with the exceptions of Jane, Michael, and those who are already aware of it like Bert and Uncle Albert), but near the start of the film, Ellen sees her and the children sliding down the banister and exiting the door to head for the park (the door opening and closing on its own). And how does she react? She simply smiles and waves, happy that she doesn't have to take on the responsibility of looking after Jane and Michael now that they have a good nanny.
</li><li> Winifred comes home to find a crowd of sooty chimney sweeps dancing around the living room, and she looks mildly surprised at best. Then she casually says to Ellen that they need to talk when Ellen has a moment.

</li><li> In prose, at least in early incarnations, the police denied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow">The Shadow</a> existed, claiming he just represented a contemporary rumor. In the 1994 Alec Baldwin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShadow">film</a>, a woman scoffs at the Shadow as just a rumor to get people to listen to the radio and read newspapers. (Earlier, the Shadow, while as Lamont Cranston at the Cobalt Club, used his powers of suggestion to dissuade Commissioner Wainright Barth from assigning his officers to investigate the rumors of the Shadow.)
</li><li> This happens often in film adaptations, which tend to focus on either the origin or early years, instead of going for a more en media res approach. In 1996's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1996">The Phantom</a></em>, someone scoffs at reports of the Phantom as "just a rumor" and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> in 2003 the police deny Daredevil as nothing more than a rumor until, in an early scene, reporter Ben Urich lights a drawing of flammable chemicals that Daredevil left behind as a Zorro mark to spell out DD.
</li><li> In the first film version of the Mack Bolan imitator <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em>, the public did not at first feel sure that the Punisher amounted to more than a rumor. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePunisher1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePunisher1989">the Lundgren film</a>, as stated in dialogue several times, Castle had apparently died in the car explosion that slew his family five years previous to the main events of the film. In the main action of the film, people still think of Castle as dead, with only his former partner thinking of him as the true identity of the Punisher. Several newspaper headlines suggest that the public did not accept that the Punisher actually operated until he started leaving knives with his skull symbol on the handle behind. (When we see the Punisher in action before the police officially identify him as the hitherto though dead Castle, though, he does not seem to have made any effort to disguise himself. Somehow, no security cameras managed to get a recording of him, it seems Before anyone says "Maybe he looked different before the explosion, maybe he had plastic surgery", sorry, when we see him in flashback, he looks the same.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuyverDarkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuyverDarkHero">Guyver Dark Hero</a></em>, a newspaper headline reads "Verdict Still Out on Armored Vigilante" perhaps indicating that much of the public has not accepted him more than a rumor.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Darkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Darkman">Darkman</a></em> sequels, a newspaper headline refers to Darkman as "an urban Bigfoot", suggesting that the public thinks of him as a rumor.

An example is given of a man who lost a bet about making a mountain entirely invisible when people noticed a suspicious extra moon in the sky - it would have been much simpler to just paint the mountain pink and put an SEP field on it, and the judge assigned to the case would have just walked near, around, and even <em>over</em> the mountain and not even notice it.

<ul><li> The entrance to Diagon Alley, a street filled with shops for wizards, is hidden behind a pub called The Leaky Cauldron which muggles never notice because they don't pay attention to their surroundings and don't expect it to be there. Though with memory charms, "Muggle repelling wards" and the charms that make Hogwarts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">look like a pile of rubble</a>, it's not so much that Muggles willfully ignore magic as that any interaction with magic tends to involve them getting parts of their cortex melted.

<div class="indent"><strong>Arthur:</strong> Bless them, they'll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it's staring them in the face...
</div></li><li> The whole world of Harry Potter relies on Muggles' inherent ignorance towards anything magical. There's an in-universe book devoted to why muggles tend to subconsciously suppress all the memories of supernatural experiences.
</li><li> In <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> the majority of wizarding Britain was putting one on themselves with the Minster's smear campaign against Harry, and willful denial of Voldemort's return.

From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallOfCthulhu">The Call of Cthulhu</a></em>:
<div class="indent">The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

When he encounters animals talking, the narrator takes glee in describing how Andrew's own Weirdness Censor engages at that moment, rendering him incapable of understanding them. Ironic in that Uncle Andrew spent his <em>whole life</em> looking for magic, and when he was finally confronted with real power, he just couldn't handle it.

</li></ul></li><li> The wizards in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series depend on this to get away with doing some forms of magic out in the open. The bullies can't hit you because your spell is deflecting their blows? They convince themselves that they didn't <em>want</em> to hit you, because invisible force fields are impossible. Vanish off a subway platform via teleporting? Whoever saw you thinks you simply moved deeper into the crowd while they weren't looking.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> is held up by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">vanilla humans</a> as much by the supernatural community, largely because people just don't want to believe that the world is saturated with murderous monsters and inexplicable magic. The safe, mundane world that most vanillas live in is a much safer and happier place if they didn't have to worry about vampires, demons, or warlocks, which explain why you never hear stories about trolls and magic. Everyone just writes it off as something mundane that, at the time, they thought was impossible. If they're attacked by a troll, for example and they're asked about it in a few months or so, they'll just claim that it was a large drug addict or something (the first few months will just have them staying quiet, afraid of people thinking they're crazy or for thinking that they 'themselves' have gone off the deep end). It also helps that human magic users tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane">screw up any kind of recording equipment</a>, making efforts to actually record evidence of the supernatural turn out to be grainy, filled with static, and generally seeming like badly distorted or faked content.
</li><li> It helps that the people who do outright report what they have seen tend to be dismissed at best, or tossed into the loony bin, or in certain cases attacked by the very things they witnessed. A good example of this is the medical examiner, Butters, who reports that several bodies he examined were clearly not human, and was thus suspended for three months and put into a psych ward for observation as a result.
</li><li> The author makes a point of justifying this every now and then, and gives at least one long speech about it. It actually makes sense, so you accept the blatant use of this trope.
</li><li> It also helps that the various supernatural powers in play have a pretty big stake in making sure humanity does <em>not</em> find out about them, given that for all the contempt most of these creatures have for humans, the last thing they want to do is get humanity riled up. While in the past a mob with torches and pitchforks could be considered a tangible threat to most supernatural creatures, humanity has since upgraded to assault rifles and attack helicopters. And now number in the billions.
</li><li> It really helps that most humans really don't want to believe that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight">Things That Go "Bump" in the Night</a> are real. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">Selective Obliviousness</a> at its finest. To the point that they will accept any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedMassHallucination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedMassHallucination">alternate "rational" explanation no matter how farfetched</a>.
</li><li> One individual, Anna Valmont, a normal human and master thief, was very suddenly pulled into the supernatural side when demons killed her partners and she finds that they were being used as a playing piece between the forces of Heaven and Hell. When she gets out, she continues with her craft, taking on clients and targets in the supernatural community, though she mentioned how easy it was to find information on the players of the supernatural world, and this trope gets mentioned again as the reason why the supernatural nations don't need to try too hard to keep concealed.

This includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personifications</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">Talking Animal</a> Gaspode the Wonder Dog (since "everyone knows dogs can't talk"). There are some exceptions, including witches and wizards, by training, and small children, because they haven't learnt what "normal" is yet.
<ul><li> Employed more subtly in the Discworld novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>. Rincewind, on yet another foreign jaunt, figures out nobody really notices men on horseback because doing so tends to get people stabbed.
</li><li> An unusual example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mort">Mort</a></em>, where the title character changes history by saving the life of a princess doomed to die, and everyone in the kingdom except a wizard find themselves unconsciously acting as though she had died, and feeling upset and nauseous when confronted with the fact that she still lives, then revert back to believing her dead once away from her.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em>, wherein the cast of the Opera House can't come up with the most obvious solutions because those just <em>aren't</em> theatrical enough.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WyrdSisters">Wyrd Sisters</a></em>: Death was visible because the audience expected he was an actor. He fit in quite well, since he forgot the lines just like the other actors.
</li><li> The Weirdness Censor appears to have been (mostly) left out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingMauriceAndHisEducatedRodents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingMauriceAndHisEducatedRodents">The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</a></em>. When said rodents decide to have a talk with the townspeople, it takes a few minutes for most of the humans to accept the existence of talking rats.
</li><li> Lord Rust in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em> confirms that it's not just the supernatural that falls subject to this trope on Discworld: his personal Weirdness Censor is so strict that it even blots out his perception of <em>rudeness</em>, on the grounds that a lowborn churl like Sam Vimes wouldn't possibly dare snark off to an aristocrat like him. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em> would later expand this into a superpower; his absolute certainty that he was invincible caused arrows to curve in flight and hit the man behind him instead.
</li><li> Moreover, it is described in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MovingPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MovingPictures">Moving Pictures</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a>!</em> as a kind of permanent level of intoxication generated by the brain to be able to ignore things that could drive it to madness, which can happen if one were to ever become "knurd" (a state of sobriety so stark that the Weirdness Censor is shut off). Some people are born "knurd", or it can be achieved by, say drinking extra-strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlatchianCoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlatchianCoffee">Klatchian Coffee</a>.
</li><li> There's also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime">Thief of Time</a></em>, where an actual horse (Binky) walks into a library to pick up Susan. But since everybody knows that that doesn't happen, it's obviously not real and therefore nothing to be concerned about.
<div class="indent">"The historians paid him no attention. Horses did not walk into libraries."
</div></li><li> Lack of this is actually given a specific name (First Sight) in the Tiffany Aching books. Having First Sight is a <em>much</em> better indication that a young girl could make a formidable witch than mere Second Sight, because it's better to be grounded than mystical.
</li></ul></li><li> This is one of the central themes of Pratchett's lesser known works, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnnyMaxwellTrilogy">Johnny Maxwell Trilogy</a></em>, where the title character explicitly lacks those kind of mental filters, so he's usually the first (and sometimes only) one to notice the weird things around him. Ironically, that same lack of mental agility makes him best equipped to actually <em>deal</em> with said weirdness, as his friends tend to try to deal according to the way things are "supposed to" go.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> books, a magical force called Mist acts as an active version to cover up whenever a mortal sees gods or monsters. A few mortals are known to be immune to its effects.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClanOfTheCaveBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClanOfTheCaveBear">Clan of the Cave Bear</a></em> series, the Clan are unable to see someone who has been sentenced to death. The person sentenced isn't killed; the medicine man says "you are dead" and everyone else assumes that to be true. Even if they do "see" the person they assume it's an evil spirit pretending to be that person. Ayla (the main character) even tells her BF in a later book that if she were to tell some Clan people they've just met that she had been sentenced to death they would instantly be unable to see her.
<ul><li> The explanation in the books regarding this is quite fuzzy. The Clan don't appear to physically lose the ability to see the person; they just believe the person is a spirit, and that if the spirit is ignored for long enough, they will disappear.
</li></ul></li><li> Lynn Mims uses this in a story in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Darkover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Darkover">Darkover</a></em> anthology&mdash;Caleb Hargrave&#146;s Weirdness Censor is so strong that it cancels out psi powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He&#146;s a walking telepathic damper... but it only works when he&#146;s nearby.</span>
</li><li> In the Hitman novels of the 1970's, featuring Mike Ross, private investigator who operated in the guise of the hockey masked figure the Hitman, the Hitman stood as legendary figure only hinted at by the media. Possibly some cover occurred.
</li><li> In Christopher Fowler's novel <em>Roofworld</em>. Why has no one noticed a shadow community living on the rooftops of London, rappelling along telegraph lines? They just don't look up much, and dismiss a glimpse of anyone they see up there if do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostThing">The Lost Thing</a></em> ends with the main character noting that he might have stopped noticing the lost things, implying that the people of the dull place he lives in are too mundane to notice something out of the ordinary like that. Earlier on, his parents don't notice that there's a giant thing in their living room until he draws their attention to it.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> and its sequels, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">Others</a> use pretty basic spells to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">humans</a> from noticing anything out-of-the-ordinary. This is done in order to prevent world-wide witch hunts. For example, the headquarters of the Moscow Night Watch are located on several floors of an office building, but these floors are invisible to humans (i.e. they think the building is smaller). It is common for crowds to simply pass by an Other hiding himself from humans without knowing why they are leaving a small area open. Also, no Other has to worry about burglars, as other spells make humans instinctively want to avoid certain places. This is mentioned by Anton when he has to pretend to be a human for several days and is not allowed to use any magic. He suddenly realizes his car could be stolen without any active wards.
</li><li> Verge Foray's novella "Practice" has an incident of this. A school for "disturbed children" is actually for psychic children. A private institute, it's subject to surprise accreditation inspections and the children conspire in the Masquerade with the non-psychic adults. When one of the kids does make a minor slip, another kid checks the inspectors' minds and finds that one of them "saw it, but he didn't believe it, so he didn't <em>see</em> it."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert">Frank Herbert</a> played with this more than once, e.g. in "The Featherbedders":
<div class="indent">...he was well within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">seventy-five percent accuracy</a> limit the Slorin set for themselves. It was a universal fact that the untrained sentience saw what it <em>thought</em> it saw. The mind tended to supply the missing elements.

The Shadowhunters, being mostly human, would normally be visible to them, but a simple bit of magic renders them unnoticeable as well.

</li><li> In Steven Gould's novel "Jumper" and the sequel "Reflex", the protagonist discovers he has the ability to teleport at will. At first he's afraid of revealing his secret if he ever "lands" somewhere within sight of anyone, but when this occurs a few times by accident, he discovers it's not a problem. Even when he instantly appears right in front of someone, the startled person just brushes it off with "oh excuse me, I didn't see you there" and dismisses it as a failure of their own attention rather than spending even a moment considering the ridiculous notion that he had just popped in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles">The Vampire Lestat</a></em>, Lestat mentions that this tendency is "a lesson about mortal piece of mind I never forgot."

<ul><li> An amusing variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, with the level of it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. The Empire refuse to believe in the existence of the Skaven (a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">technologically advanced</a> rat-people, living just under the surface), despite the fact that half-human Beastmen, Elves, Dwarves (who exist in a constant state of war with the Skaven), magic and freaking Dragons are just a fact of life in the Empire . This has been explained back and forth by either the Empire keeping it quiet to keep everyone from panicking, the Skaven keeping it quiet in their own best interest, people just assuming they're a Beastmen variant or some innate magic of the Skaven making everyone forget.
</li><li> One of the character classes of the Palladium RPG <em>Beyond the Supernatural</em> is the "Nega-Psychic": a person whose disbelief in the supernatural is so strong that it provides him with enhanced saving rolls versus supernatural phenomena and allows cancellation of supernatural effects. (This means that the nega-psychic character spends the entire game loudly wondering why everyone else in the party is getting so excited by "swamp gas," something which appeals to certain types of role-players, but drives others up the wall.)
</li><li> The Third Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>, specifically in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSIlluminatiUniversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSIlluminatiUniversity">IOU</a></em> setting, included an advantageous character trait called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Mundanity</a>". The advantage comes in a variety of levels. At its most expensive and intense level, any character with that trait has a chance of turning anything he / she sees that isn't considered "normal" into something normal. For example: demons turn into men in demon suits, ray guns turn into squirt guns, etc. It's sort of like a weaponized version of Sunnydale Syndrome.
</li><li> Practically a part of everyday human existence in the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness">The World of Darkness</a></em> games.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em>, werewolves (and other shapeshifters, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">werefoxes</a>), have the Delirium. This means that (most) mortals, upon seeing a werewolf in true form, freak out hysterically, and forget about what happened later. However, relying on this to maintain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> is pointedly a stupid idea and usually outlawed in shapeshifter societies, as the various enemies who know about them can simply follow incidences of such hysteria to track down the protagonists.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">Changeling: The Dreaming</a></em>, changelings are prone to Banality (the death of imagination), which not only shuts down their magic, but is potentially lethal to them, and if they manage to use their magic in front of mortals, the Mists will erase the knowledge of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em> has a similar censorship mechanic called the Fog, where mortals who see wraiths and experience their powers will react with mortal terror, then write it all off as a nightmare or trick of the light.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>, humanity has been so convinced to accept a paradigm of what is and what isn't possible that anything too blatantly "magical" usually results in reality itself backlashing against mages in the form of "Paradox." The presence of normal humans actively disrupts magic. The mere act of observing a mage's supernatural abilities can cause their spells to decay into nothingness. The Arcane advantage doubles down on this by making the mage himself tend to slip out of both physical records and human memory, meaning that the censor extends even to people actively trying to figure it out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>-only examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> keeps Paradox, but in this case, it's coded into the very laws of the universe. Human observation will cause magic to decay (due to the Lie), but the very act of performing something explicitly magical runs the risk of the universe (or... something worse) pantsing you. Related to this is Quiescence, the tendency of humans to rationalize and forget anything obviously magical that they witnessed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">Werewolf: The Forsaken</a></em> has Lunacy, which is equivalent to Delirium. Instead of being the ancestral memories of werewolves culling humans, however, it's a gift by their patron goddess Luna that keeps humanity from easily finding the beasts in their midst.
</li><li> A similar effect occurs in the <em>Second Sight</em> splatbook, where almost all humans are latent psychics, but since they don't believe in psychics, end up using their abilities to suppress the unbelievable psychic acts of others. Conversely, it's possible for characters to gain an advantage in the form of a believing hanger-on who actually makes their psychic abilities perform better.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>, all changeling magic (as well as the changeling's inhuman appearance) is covered by "the Mask". A seven-foot-tall cyclops with fey armour sculpted from living, rune-etched wood looks like a banged-up old bouncer with an eye patch and hockey pads, and so on.
</li><li> Averted in the fan-game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em>: the rules explicitly state that nothing about Mad Science clouds men's minds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Causes insanity</a> yes, but if you resist that (and it doesn't kill you before you can tell anyone) there's no censor.

</li><li> Other fan-game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful">Princess: The Hopeful</a></em> has an optional rule allowing to apply the trope to Princesses' outfits; according to this rule, the Nobles' magic combined with mortals' natural tendency to ignore the supernatural means a Princess dressed in a futuristic sci-fi outfit can go around in public completely unnoticed, aside from people noticing she looks a bit "nerdy".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Swedish horror game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Kult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Kult">Kult</a></em> makes this the central premise of the world's mythology: Humanity has been imprisoned in an illusory world by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">Demiurge</a> and blinded to the real world around them. When supernatural events transpire around them, the illusion-spell in people's minds makes them rationalize it away as normal accidents.
</li><li> In two of the four main variants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Tabletop Games</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern">d20 Modern</a></em>, monsters roam the modern world. However, most humans can't believe that they exist, so they just see humans where player characters see monsters. (These settings are called Urban Arcana and Shadow Chasers, if you're wondering.) The average joe walks around in a state of autopilot, it's explained, so while they do see monsters as monsters while they're around, their mind subconsciously edits it out later, remembering a troll as a massive brute of a man, the dragon's fireball as a gas leak, the gnoll in the corner a shady guy wearing a trenchcoat. They also don't notice things that the more alert player characters and "aware" NPCs do, such as aforementioned shady man having slightly protruding ears...

<ul><li> The core rule books advise the DM and the players to <em>avoid</em> this; if you're playing in a setting where you can buy and sell magic items fairly easily, it kind of behooves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> to notice magic, and not knock it as "superstition."
</li><li> Except in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>, where noticing what's <em>spooky</em> and magical can get you killed. Natives of domains such as Richemulot or Zherisia, where the populace is infiltrated by monsters, find it a <em>lot</em> safer not to admit they've seen anything suspicious, even to themselves.
</li><li> Outsiders embodying the multiverse's Lawful alignments can have trouble with this, becoming so used to following rules that they assume that everyone else is too. So that group of mortals moving through the Nine Hells of Baator must be mercenaries or cultists on official business, and not, say, an adventuring party raiding the Lower Planes.
</li><li> Successfully making your Will saving throw against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">demon queen</a> Pale Night means that you've managed to activate a Weirdness Censor as a defensive mechanism, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">You Cannot Grasp the True Form</a> of such a primordial horror. It's implied that her standard appearance, that of a hovering feminine figure wrapped in a billowing white sheet, is some sort of cosmic censor.

Yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">muggles</a> are particularity shocked whenever something magical happens around them, and are fast to shrug it off as something mundane instead of magic. This is played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the kobolds, which in this setting are supernatural beings of near infinite power... and only use it for mischief or if enlisted by an deity for a particular job to guard an area.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Nobilis</a></em> averts this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> may go mad from encountering what they could not possibly understand and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Nobles</a> must take pains to ensure that this will not happen. However, their bosses, the Imperators, are powerful enough that reality itself will censor their actions. If an Imperator blots out the sun, not only will everyone believe it's a solar eclipse, but scientists will have retroactively predicted it several weeks ago. Third edition tones this down a bit, with most miracles having a degree of muggle-safety, but pulling off stuff that's too blatant will still cause dementia animus.

This is rather odd, because in the second game, the minions of the Prime Evils seemed to rampage across most of the known world, and most of the NPCs you talk to seemed aware of the cause of the problem.
<ul><li> Even in one of the novels, a necromancer comments that their seers <em>suspect</em> that Baal is responsible for the destruction of Mount Arreat in the Lord of Destruction expansion pack. Not only do the necromancers usually seem more aware of what's going on than the rest of the world, but Baal was anything but subtle during his assault. Baal wasn't exactly skipping merrily to the summit, though. He killed cities and possibly <em>kingdoms</em> that were in his way. Who's left to say what really went on besides some reclusive, not terribly credible barbarians?
<ul><li> In the absence of forensics science, evidence of the Prime Evils rests entirely on eye witnesses.

Nah, that's fine. There's a small chance that a pedestrian or marine will look at you, look away, and say "fucking New York." Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">that sort of thing happens all the time here.</a>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, Tamriel has one, partly thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialAtmosphericActions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialAtmosphericActions">Artificial Atmospheric Actions</a>. NPCs will suffer odd pathing issues and will get stuck trying to walk through each other. Guards will ignore people attacking you, but if you attack someone, they'll immediately try to arrest you for committing a crime. You can murder someone in cold blood in the street, pay your fine, and then otherwise walk away scot-free. You can fire an arrow into a person's head from stealth, and that person will dismiss it as <em>the wind</em>. Odd circumstances crop up where two guards will suddenly try to kill each other because one accidentally struck a friendly NPC while fighting a legitimate enemy and the other considered it a crime. You may help a village defend against an attack but then immediately find yourself under arrest because you accidentally killed a chicken in the fighting. You'll wake up to find yourself being attacked by an assassin or a zombie but your bunkmate won't lift a finger to help you. Many fans actually <em>enjoy</em> this aspect of the series because the weirdness is just that entertaining sometimes.

<ul><li> Subverted in <em>Dark Dawn</em> when Briggs recognizes Matthew &amp; Co. because he saw them handwaving crates around on the other side of the dock... but it's implied that he <em>knew what to look for</em> since he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">dealt with Adepts before</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages">lives with a few</a>), making him more of an exception that proves the rule.
</li></ul></li><li> The iOS game <em>Plague Inc.</em> (similar in many respects to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pandemic">Pandemic</a></em>) has several types of plagues that can be unleashed. The "parasite" type has additional abilities that can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">evolved</a> that hide it from notice by people. In game terms, this decreases the "severity" stat to <em>below zero</em>. What this means is that the symptoms can include nausea, coughing + vomiting (which enables projectile vomiting) and still not think anything is wrong. You can have the entire <em>world</em> have these symptoms with no one the wiser. It's not until you "evolve" deadly symptoms and people start dying by the millions that anybody starts to consider that something strange is going on. The same can be done with the special Neurax Worm plague type, but that is implied to be a semi-sentient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Puppeteer Parasite</a>.

After a couple of weeks of studying at a school for the physically disabled, the main character notices that he's been developing a Weirdness Censor of sorts for his classmates' various disabilities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em> plays this quite literally.

However, the background characters for the Cairo stage simply do not care about the insanity occurring right next to them. Granted, Stands are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">Invisible to Normals</a>, but they should still see such things as a man teleporting around and dropping <em>steamrollers</em>, a woman unraveling herself into string, a man's bullets being redirected in a zigzag pattern, or <em>a long-dead president of the United States (though to be fair, not one from this present timeline) disappearing into an American Flag</em>, or any one of the crazy things from the first two parts, but no one bats an eye. They don't even react when a car speeds <em>right past</em> their table.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Octodad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Octodad">Octodad</a></em>, the great majority of people don't seem to think strange a "man" walks in bizarre patterns, talks in blurbs, has tentacles instead of arms and legs or causes great amounts of property damage doing even the most mundane of tasks. The only person who knows his secret is a psychotic chef and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his daughter, who assumed that everyone already knew</span>.

The player character (who, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a>, has the least character out of anyone in the cast) doesn't comment on <em>any</em> of this, even when Natsuki notices the changes in Yuri and tries to go to the player for help, only for her face to suddenly disappear as she tells the player to forget about her and Yuri once Monika gets to her. Eventually it gets so bad that even when Yuri catches the player character alone, confesses her love in an <em>extremely</em> creepy way, and then stabs herself to death in front of the player no matter whether the player accepts her confession or not, the PC has <em>zero</em> reaction to any of it and ends up just staring blankly at her dead body for an entire in-game weekend as he functionally ceases to be a character.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDarksideDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDarksideDetective">The Darkside Detective</a></em>, most of the population of Twin Lakes seems to just ignore the supernatural events going on around them. At one point a computer operator comments that she can't figure out why the computer's on the fritz when there's a gremlin standing right next to her loudly nomming on the wiring. In the finale chapter, an incipient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> is treated as non-supernatural rioting by everybody except the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccultDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccultDetective">Occult Detective</a> protagonist and a priest he joins forces with.

Also, when the clone-Dave is under the effect of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Science</a> cure, he too is affected, even while in the midst of a running battle.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> to some degree, because not only does Tokyo get destroyed so often that nobody really cares, but also because the destruction rampages are scheduled and supervised by the Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division. There is also some suggestion that many of the more outrageous aspects of Tokyo life are in fact literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals">Invisible to Normals</a>, but the actual extent of this effect remains unclear.

In the fifth collection of Megatokyo, Gallagher FINALLY detailed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">his explanation for this phenomenon</a>: "<a class="urllink" href="https://wikitokyo.org/wiki/What_is_Megatokyo_all_about%3F">...the main theme of Megatokyo is how everyone has different perceptions of the world around them...<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" Everyone sees the world slightly differently. Piro and Largo are on the extreme ends of the scale&mdash;Piro only sees "mundane" things (and dismisses the fantastic things as mundane things) and Largo only sees "fantastic" things, and comes up with fantastic explanations for the mundane things he sees. Everyone else is somewhere else on this scale, nearly always between those two extremes.
</li><li> It seems as though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Miho</a> has the power to <em>turn off</em> other people's Weirdness Censors.

Even Bob himself often refuses to acknowledge just <em>how</em> bizarre the situations are that he finds himself in. The only castmember completely free of this trope is Jean, leading her to exclaim at one point, <a class="urllink" href="http://bobadventures.comicgenesis.com/d/20071006.html">"Ye gods!

<div class="indent"><strong>Frank Grimes:</strong> I'm saying you're what's wrong with America, Simpson.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, Danny feels perfectly secure transforming into a ghost if he ducks inside a locker or even stands behind another person to do so. Apparently nobody makes the connection that a kid moving to a just-concealed area, disappearing, and being replaced by a ghost might mean something. Also, people can be attacked by giant ghost wasps and such like at school and will run screaming as expected... but the next day, everyone's fine; law enforcement is never called and nobody seems to remember being terrorized by supernatural entities.
<ul><li> Also possibly subverted, in that Danny's sister witnesses him transform and fly off into the sky early in the series, and asks his two friends (who are in on the secret) "Did you see that?"... and then manages to convince them, very easily, that she is affected by the weirdness censor and thinks she was imagining it. In fact, she quickly accepts Danny's secret and later helps and supports him without his knowledge.
</li><li> Paulina lampshades the first part in one episode, where she invites Fenton to her birthday party because he always seems be there whenever his alter ego shows up to save the day, meaning Phantom would come if Fenton did. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">She never puts two and two together, though.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> uses this trope; though it is completely obvious that Zim is an alien (he has green skin and no ears or nose), Dib is the only one who ever notices (aside from his sister Gaz, who simply doesn't care). Likewise any time something bizarre happens most people either ignore it, or notice it but never question how or why it happened in the first place. (Or if they do, Dib usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">somehow gets unfairly blamed</a>).

</li><li> Also, in the episode where they get a poltergeist, Lois pushes in some chairs around the dinner table and then turns around. When she turns back, they're all stacked in a pyramid on the table, and she says "Oh, I must have just stacked them wrong and not realized it. Yeah, that's it...."
</li><li> Peter's fights with the giant chicken are treated this way. In one extreme example, Peter and Lois were interrupted mid-conversation by the chicken attacking Peter.

No one in the city notices this fight because the regent for the heart of Earth makes it look like it was a cartoon on a big billboard downtown.
<ul><li> Also, during the first season no one seems to notice or question the frequent appearance of portals or girls with wings and magical powers closing those portals.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">original cartoon</a> had a sort of Masquerade for the first few episodes, but after a bit the Transformers didn't bother with hiding from humans as a whole (though many people still seemed unaware of their existence, considering all the episodes where a human mistakes a Transformer for a normal vehicle and react with shock/fear/awe when the Transformer reveals himself). By the movie and season three, there was no Masquerade anymore.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersSuperGodMasterforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersSuperGodMasterforce">Transformers: Super-God Masterforce</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Expose_the_Decepticons%27_Dark_Trap%21">This<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was a ridiculous case when the humans completely forgotten about what Autobots AND Decepticons are despite the series (in Japan) had already established the existence of both, not in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> level, mind you, but it's as if they forgotten.

<ul><li> The rest of the town, however, barely reacts to any of the strange things going on. While a lot of the weirdness is occurring in the woods and may not be perfectly in sight, things like a giant rampaging gnome made of smaller gnomes or a two-dimensional, pixelated video game character destroying things throughout the town would be pretty hard to miss. All it takes for Mermando to hide his identity as a mermaid is a conveniently-placed pool raft, and the teenagers seem to go more or less back to normal after their encounter with the convenience store ghosts and never mention it again.
<ul><li> Possibly justified because even without the supernatural elements, the town is pretty strange by itself: for example, one episode has Pool Check the pool manager <em>lock a kid up in the drain</em> for unknown reasons and an indeterminate amount of time.
</li></ul></li><li> There turns out to be a good reason for this in the season 2 episode "Society of the Blind Eye": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the eponymous Society has been kidnapping people who <em>do</em> see the supernatural and erasing their memories</span>.
</li><li> Then, in the final episode after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">said Society was no longer active</span>, the mayor declares the "Never Mind All That" act, wherein the whole town agrees to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain">not talk about</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Weirdmageddon</span> with outsiders.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012">Littlest Pet Shop (2012)</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S4E5LittlestPetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S4E5LittlestPetShopOfHorrors">Littlest Pet Shop of Horrors</a>": The shop receives a guest, a vampire bat named Vlad. Vlad openly does stereotypical vampire-like things, like attempting to bite the other characters' necks, lacking a reflection, repulsion by crosses and garlic, sleeping in a coffin, and getting burned by sunlight. Only Russell catches on that he's a vampire, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">everyone else refuses to believe him</a> (under the idea that Vlad never said he was a vampire), forcing Russell to fight Vlad on his own while being hindered by his friends.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> episode "Romeo And Smurfette", when the Smurfs capture Papa Smurf posing as Gargamel after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a> and stake him down, they refuse to believe that he is actually Papa Smurf despite the fact that he is clearly speaking to them in Papa Smurf's voice. Since this scene was actually adapted from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">the comic book</a> story "Smurf Vs. Smurf", it's obvious that the attempt to translate this mistake in knowing who's actually in the appearance of Gargamel did not work as well as it did in the comic book, where even Hefty without his tattoo mark in the comic book version of "King Smurf" had trouble convincing his fellow Smurfs who he actually is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em>, <strong>nobody</strong> in Boxwood Terrace (save for Mitchell), acknowledges the alien behaviors of the Propulsions, or notice their minivan turning into a flying saucer.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>; Hank Hill's unique form of eccentricity makes him literally <em>incapable of understanding</em> things that strongly contradict his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">strongly conservative</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOlBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOlBoy">Good Ol' Boy</a> values. Most notably, in one episode when he meets his wife Peggy's friend, "Caroline", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen">Drag Queen</a>, Hank genuinely believes that "she's" a woman because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">he refuses to believe that men would dress as women even after being told the truth</a>.

<ul><li> One classic demonstration of a real-life version of this trope, which psychologists refer to as the "Selective Attention" phenomenon can be seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JONMYxaZ_s&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLB228A1652CD49370&amp;index=2">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. When your attention is even mildly focused on something else, you simply don't notice bizarre things happening.
</li><li> Another related form of weirdness censor is called change blindness. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3iPrBrGSJM">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> demonstrates how far the brain will go to avoid acknowledging even a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>.
</li><li> A third type is known as a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases">"memory bias"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; a tendency to rationalize, dismiss, or otherwise distort memories that are unpleasant, unusual, or inconvenient enough. Your brain, in effect, decides that an unsettling event was just a dream or that something that has changed was always that way, and you simply never noticed. This is the reason why people idealize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodOldDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodOldDays">The Good Old Days</a>, for instance. They literally only recall the good parts.
</li><li> In a study about ball lightning, a very poorly understood electromagnetic meteorological phenomenon, it was found that a third of people in the United States had seen ball lightning but never told anyone. The reason was simple, ball lightning has no pressence in modern day pop culture (unlike cryptids) and is visually simple enough (a ball of light) that the ones that do can simply convince themselves it was simply an optical illusion.
</li><li> The game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Geocaching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Geocaching">Geocaching</a> relies pretty heavily on this. Geocache containers can be hidden in highly unusual places, quite often by virtue of small size, camouflage coloring, or by being disguised as something so commonplace it is easily dismissed and overlooked. Searching for geocaches often calls for <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching#Controversy_and_issues">stealth,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> some cachers have reported that the easiest way to conceal their search is by acting mildly nuts or wandering at complete random, and thus they can find their objective without anyone taking much notice.
</li><li> Invoked by various conspiracy theories, New Age mythology and fringe cults- that the human race is instinctively in denial of the true nature of reality.
</li><li> The Internet and its denizens have it full-stop. Compared to what's acceptable and/or normal in real life, websites with a dedicated enough userbase to have a community, fan bases, and the like do some <em>pretty freaking weird stuff</em> that happens without so much as attracting a second glance. In fact, pointing out the weirdness of this online will likely have you branded as a NORP/newfag/noob and lambasted until you retreat.
</li><li> Roger Penrose's <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_censorship_hypothesis">Cosmic censorship hypothesis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Or a way to hide a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">naked singularity</a> of the rest of the Universe.
</li><li> When you dream your frontal lobe is suppressed. Among other things, the frontal lobe serves as the "fact checker" part of the brain. This is why you don't think anything is weird when (for example) your dog can talk in a dream.
