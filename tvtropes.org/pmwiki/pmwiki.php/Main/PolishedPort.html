<p>Porting a game from one platform to the other generally carries a lot of preconceptions, and not entirely without reason. These days, gamers are accustomed to seeing poor porting jobs done by lazy developers looking to make a quick buck without taking the time to iron out the issues with the new versions.
</p><p>It doesn't have to be this way, of course: Sometimes, being able to port a game from one platform to another gives developers the extra time they would have already needed to polish their game up, tweaking the gameplay, possibly even adding new levels, and in the best-case scenario, eliminating the technical limitations that held back the original releases. And this is when that happens: Ports that exceed the originals far and away, and are likely to go on to be revered as the greatest possible versions of that game. In the most extreme cases, the ports themselves can take a game that was average at best, and <em>elevate</em> that game into classic status. And sometimes this trope means that a godawful game becomes at least playable&mdash;in short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> inverted.

While emulation usually introduces problems of its own (such as requiring the host system to be several times more powerful than the original), it can also improve upon the performance of the original console's hardware. For consoles that originally used optical media, the use of virtual drives can reduce load times dramatically. Modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GraphicsProcessingUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GraphicsProcessingUnit">GPUs</a> can easily outperform those of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, which means that emulation for their games can be rendered in much higher resolutions than the original consoles were capable of. Save states can even be used to bypass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">Save-Game Limits</a>. Of course, emulation itself (barring official examples such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> and PlayStation Classics) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">a pretty controversial subject,</a> and while emulators themselves are perfectly legal, the ownership and use of downloaded ROMs, ISO files, BIOSes, etc. are a rather murky gray area.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nintendo could've phoned it in with their inevitable port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">GBA</a>. A good game on its own merit with controls modified to make up for the lack of two buttons. What did we get? Additional sounds, the ability to continue from the area you saved or died in, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwords">Four Swords</a></em> multi-player mode and an extra quest and dungeon that are connected to said multi-player mode. Giving you the option to play with the original SNES palette was good too (in contrast to the brightened graphics ports to the GBA often use to compensate for the original model's unlit screen). The only downsides are the lower music quality due to the GBA's inferior sound chip, and for some people, Link now having a voice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> was ported to the GameCube as part of the Master Quest bonus disc for pre-ordering <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> and was also a part of the <em>Collector's Edition</em> compilation Nintendo gave away at various times (such as to people who had registered a system and games on Nintendo's website or to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a></em> subscribers). The visuals remained largely unchanged, but most of the textures were made slightly sharper and the game's references to button inputs were changed to match the GameCube controller.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>, already a gorgeous game for GameCube, was further revamped for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> with refined visuals, as well as major improvements over some time-consuming parts, such as the sea travel, the Triforce hunt and the Nintendo Gallery, plus the addition of Miiverse features, increased wallet sizes, a harder Hero Mode difficulty setting (which can be accessed immediately and turned off at any time), and a refined soundtrack. The only drawback is the removal of the Tingle Tuner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiPlatform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiPlatform">Multi-Platform</a> release for GCN and Wii, was ported in 2016 for the Wii U which, in addition to featuring updated HD graphics that fix much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a> complaints about the original version, includes a new item that aids in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">annoying</a> ghost-hunting sidequest, amiibo and Miiverse support, a button to instantly transform between Link's human and wolf forms without having to talk to Midna, increased wallet sizes, and an optional "Hero Mode" setting that substantially ups the difficulty. Also, the regular difficulty uses the GameCube orientation while Hero Mode is mirrored, <em>&agrave; la</em> the Wii version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL 2: Mission: Las Vegum</em> came out on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a> a year after the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> and PC releases. While the visuals got a downgrade (the scenery is less detailed), it makes up with some extras that are exemplified by its new subtitle, <em>Mission: Wifix</em>: thanks to the Wi-Fi capabilities of the system, a second player can join the main game mode (in the original version you can only switch between the two Gauls and one stays always CPU-cntrolled), and several mini-games for up to four players have been added.
</li><li> <em>Asterix at the Olympic Games</em> was initially released on Wii, PlayStation 2 and PC, with the latter version being marginally better because, at least, it could enjoy a better frame-rate and higher resolutions. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> port was released almost a year later and they made good use of that time: beside the advantages of the higher system specs over the previous console releases, it's got textures of much better quality than the ones in the PC version, making this the definitive version of the game (for what it's worth).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Dreamcast</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Soul Reaver</a></em> was released a fair bit after the PC and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> versions, and the benefits of fancier hardware with redrawn higher-res textures and more complex character models make it the version to play.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DustAnElysianTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DustAnElysianTail">Dust: An Elysian Tail</a></em> was ported from the Xbox 360 to Windows by the developer himself. Dean designed the port with PC gamers in mind, being one himself, and put forth the effort of making a port that PC gamers would be happy with, and succeeded. The PC version hosts multiple of visual options and tweaks, crisper graphics, and the option of using higher-quality character portraits during dialogue. The game also works remarkably well with keyboard and mouse for a console-to-PC conversion, and you can switch back and forth between keyboard to controller on the fly.
</li><li> Released at a time when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> was celebrating its tenth year, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a></em> pulls off a stellar port with textures and effects comparable to that of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> version. In 2015, the Xbox 360 was largely being cast to the wayside (evidenced by Activision's half-hearted "port" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</a></em> that didn't even include the single-player campaign and dropped the normally-smooth <em>Call of Duty</em> gameplay to a sluggish 30 FPS) so the level of love and effort put into <em>Rise</em> is pretty phenomenal (and on top of that, they even managed to somehow get such an impressive product onto a single DVD disc when games even older than it were having to ship on two for the Xbox 360).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoStarWars">LEGO Star Wars</a> the Complete Saga</em>. On top of containing both the prior games and all their content, with free rein to mix and match, it also adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel">the improvements of the second game</a> to the original, including better vehicle levels and every character being able to build.
</li><li> The number of ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> is comparable to the number of ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar">Lunar: The Silver Star</a></em>, and each capitalizes on the last. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare">WiiWare</a> port has redone sprites, the ability to play as Curly, and the European version gets an additional soundtrack.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uirn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0uirn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uirn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later the NA version would have its debatable soundtrack replaced with the European soundtrack.</span> <em>Cave Story +</em> has all this and the Wind Fortress, somehow harder than the Sacred Grounds. <em>3D</em> has polygonal models, and <em>Cave Story +</em>'s eShop release boasts everything <em>+</em> does but the graphics, and to compensate it's in stunning 3D. The Switch version then adds onto all of this with the Wii's remastered graphics, animated talking sprites, widescreen, some gorgeous subtle lighting effects, and co-op in a later update.

<ul><li> The PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em>: After the outsourced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disasters</a> that were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening">DMC3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> got the hint and handled the port of <em>DMC4</em> entirely in-house, developing it alongside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> versions. So why the long gap between the console and PC releases? Because Capcom wanted to get it right, and that they did. Besides delivering a game that could run decently on older systems and awesomely on recent ones, they also added the surprisingly cathartic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Legendary Dark Knight</a> difficulty level, which is essentially the normal difficulty level with <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">lots</a></strong></em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, made possible by the greater processing power high-end PCs have over consoles. Since then, Capcom have delivered a host of fantastic PC ports to their games, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> (which includes addition visual tweaks as a PC-exclusive bonus) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> (which comes certified for 3D vision, assuming you have the right peripherals). Unfortunately, "rampant piracy" (rather than sales of paying customers) of the PC version of <em>SFIV</em> meant that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapcomSequelStagnation">Super Street Fighter IV</a></em> only came out as part of the Arcade Edition release, and <em>Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition</em> took five years to come to PC.
</li><li> No matter which side of the controversy you put yourself at, one thing is clear: The guys at QLOC did one <em>hell</em> of a good job when working on the PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry">DmC: Devil May Cry</a></em> (the other consoles were made by Ninja Theory). The game truly shines in the graphic department when played on a PC, and there is also the fact that the game is actually playable and doable, even on higher difficulties, with keyboard and mouse, without control issues of any kind, very much not what you would expect of a spectacle fighter. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One later received a <em>Definitive Edition</em> with visuals on par with the PC port running in 1080p at 60 FPS, bundles all of the game's DLCs, adds a slew of new modes, readjusts many gameplay elements, adds a new <em>DMC1</em> skin for Dante, and features a Bloody Palace mode for Vergil.
</li><li> While the <em>Devil May Cry HD Collection</em> containing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">one</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry2">two</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3">three</a> had its fair share of small issues due to having to work with pre-release code rather than finalized builds, they were already a solid way to play the original PS2 games (or, at least the good pair). When it was ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> however, <em>Devil May Cry 3</em> in particular was given several new features: the Style Change of its sequel, meaning Dante can use all six styles on the fly, full weapon switching so the player never has to manage their gear between missions or at divinity statues, and full on local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoOpMultiplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoOpMultiplayer">Co-Op Multiplayer</a> for Bloody Palace, allowing two players to use different saves and even have Dante and Vergil team up with an overhauled camera just to keep both players on-screen (or split screen in the case of boss fights).
</li><li> While the NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em> may not had the same detailed graphics as the arcade version, the stages were greatly expanded and rearranged from the arcade version, with more traps and pitfalls to avoid in addition to the usual assortment of enemy grunts, cannons, and vehicles to destroy. The change from the arcade version's vertical setup to a traditional horizontal one also makes the action less constrained and there are more power-up capsules and pill-box sensors than in the arcade version (and unlike the arcade version, there's no need to downgrade to the default gun to obtain some of them). The boss of the Waterfall stage was even changed from a generic sensor defended by two rotating guns and a five-way cannon to an alien statue that spits fireballs with its tentacles and mouth. The time limit from the 3D stages was also removed and the music is faster paced than the arcade version (as mentioned above).
<ul><li> <em>Super C</em>, the NES version of <em>Super Contra</em>, is also considerably different from its arcade counterpart. Whereas the arcade game featured an upgradeable weapon system and loose jumping controls, the NES version used the same play mechanics and power-ups as the first NES game, with the main changes being replacing the 3D stages with overhead stages much like its arcade counterpart and turning the Fire Gun into a useful weapon. The stage designs and order are roughly the same as the arcade version's at first, but the game deviates from the second half of Stage 3 and onward by adding plenty of new stages and rearranging the order of the final set of bosses.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> was ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as <em>No More Heroes: Heroes' Paradise</em>, featuring high-resolution graphics, revamped controls and alternate, more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">stripperific</a> costumes for the female characters in Very Sweet Mode. The PS3 version supports PlayStation Move. The Xbox 360 version never made it outside Japan though.
</li><li> The HD Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner</a></em> for the PlayStation 3 was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">the opposite of this</a> up until Konami and Hexa Drive released the version 2.0 patch to undo the damage done by High Voltage Software (a lesson they didn't learn from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill HD Collection</a></em>). After the patch, it runs on a much smoother frame-rate with completely re-vamped the visuals for 1080p. The version of <em>The 2nd Runner</em> that was used in the HD Collection is also the never-released-to-the-States Special Edition, which featured more missions, new cut-scenes and battle sequences for the main story, extra difficulty levels, and new VR tutorials for the sub-weapons. Unfortunately, Xbox 360 owners are left in the dirt.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Genocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Genocide">Genocide</a><sup>2</sup>: Genocide Square</em> compilation for FM Towns is a much improved version of the original Sharp X68000 games, especially the first game. The first <em>Genocide</em> has re-balanced enemy placement and difficulty, while the sequel removes the cooldown meter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Betty+</a>, adds an individual Weapon Select button to make weapon changes much more simpler than the original, and more attacks to perform with your saber. It also features new cut-scenes that fleshes out the story more, updated graphics, and remixed music for both games. The DOS version of <em>Genocide 2</em> is more-or-less a port based the FM Towns version. It goes back to the Sharp X68000 cut-scenes and features slightly less colors used but has enhanced CD-quality music.

</li><li> Don't have a Wii U, but have a Switch? Fret not, the first two games are on Switch as well (as part of a promotional campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta3">Bayonetta 3</a></em>), with everything the Wii U versions have on a console you can play on the go.
</li><li> The PC port of the game provides plenty of graphics options and manages to outclass the console versions in terms of image quality and performance, running at a mostly stable 60 FPS during gameplay, though cutscenes run at 30 FPS.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em> was greatly improved on its CD-ROM release, with pictures of the items in the inventory rather than text, a more concise set of commands, and most importantly, came on one disc, rather than several floppies. The only drawback was that they removed the 'stump joke' which is one of the most popular jokes in the series.
</li><li> The PC version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromMonkeyIsland">Escape from Monkey Island</a></em> is filled with lag issues and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bugs</a>, but the PlayStation 2 version doesn't have them and also comes on one disc rather than two. Most importantly, the controls are mapped to the controller rather than random keys, making for a more intuitive experience.
</li><li> As shown in <a class="urllink" href="http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2010/05/mystery-of-japanese-mystery-house.html">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> article, the Japanese PC version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a>'s first graphic adventure <em>Mystery House</em> kept the graphics as black-and-white line drawings but redrew them to look more professional. The same publisher released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeisureSuitLarry">Softporn Adventure</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC88">PC-88</a> as <em>Las Vegas</em>, with original graphics added.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Enchanter">Enchanter</a></em> got ported to Japan in early 1993, software development company SystemSoft reworked the game by adding a few improvements, such as the recognition of verb commands typed in kana or the Latin alphabet; the access of such verb commands by pressing corresponding buttons (the player still has to type the name of an object, though); the display of a list of objects in the environment after the player has typed in a command; and the addition of enhanced graphics and artistic background pictures in every location on which the text is super-imposed. The game was then released for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC98" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC98">PC-98</a> in March 1993 as <em>Enchanter: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForeignSubtitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForeignSubtitle">Wakaki Mad&#333;shi no Shir&eacute;n</a></em> (<em>Enchanter: The Trial of the Young Sorcerer</em>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeadOverHeels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeadOverHeels">Head Over Heels</a></em> was converted from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC">Amstrad CPC</a> by the original coding team, who put in a few fixes as well as making excellent use of the four-color palette of the CPC's higher-resolution mode (which was used far less colorfully in all too many ports of Speccy games).

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> port of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a>. Among the improvements: The graphics are more colorful, the music is better (sounding more rock-inspired than the NES), there are some bug fixes, and most importantly, the game is <em>much</em> more forgiving than the NES version, particularly in the levels "Turbo Tunnel" and "Volkmire's Inferno".
</li><li> The Genesis version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainAmericaAndTheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainAmericaAndTheAvengers">Captain America and the Avengers</a></em>, unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">SNES version</a>, is reasonably similar to the arcade version, including all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">hilariously bad</a> voice acting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon</a> II</em> for the NES added story sequences to further the storyline. The levels were edited to contain more platforming, and the NES version had nine levels as opposed to the four the arcade version contained. The ending was also changed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a> One</em> is a GBA port of <em>Final Fight Guy</em>, which in turn was a slightly enhanced version of the original SNES port of <em>Final Fight</em> (it replaced Cody with Guy, added a few new power-ups, and featured different enemy placement). While it isn't quite as good as the arcade version, it does fix many of the problems present in the SNES version like the fact that it has all three characters (Cody is brought back), it has a 2-Player mode (via link cable) and the Industrial Area stage with Rolento is restored. This version also added versions of Guy and Cody from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em>, even with their own plotlines recognizing this. There was also the Sega CD version of <em>Final Fight</em>. Not only does it include all six stages, all three main characters and the 2-player co-op mode, it also made good use of the CD add-on and upped the music quality considerably.
</li><li> The Genesis version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenAxe">Golden Axe</a></em> added an extra level, a new final boss, an Easy Mode, a "Duel Mode", and more color schemes for enemies. The MS-DOS version had all this and 256-color graphics, but also lower-quality sound effects.
</li><li> The SNES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTurtlesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTurtlesInTime">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</a></em> had slightly lower graphics quality than its arcade predecessor, but made up for it by having somewhat higher sound quality and including an extra stage, several new game play modes, the ability to change the Turtles' coloration to darker comic/movie colors instead of their bright green cartoon coloration and several new and/or redesigned bosses.
</li><li> The PlayStation 2 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe">Viewtiful Joe</a></em> included a new, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">very easy</a> difficulty called "Sweet" (originally from the Japan-only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Viewtiful Joe: Revival</a></em>), as well as Dante from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> as an unlockable character.
</li><li> The PSP port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a> 2</em> by Koei Canada included the extra characters and stages from the Japan-exclusive <em>Warriors Orochi Z</em> complete with English voices, after that version was canned for Western release. It helped that the game ran amazingly well on the portable, too.
</li><li> The PC Engine CD port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadStalkerFullMetalForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadStalkerFullMetalForce">Mad Stalker: Full Metal Force</a></em> has updated graphics, a remixed soundtrack, two more playable characters for its Story Mode, and animated cut-scenes in between certain stages of the game. Unfortunately, it never left Japan in any shape or form.
</li><li> M2's version of <em>Sega Vintage Collection: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenAxe">Golden Axe</a></em> on Xbox LIVE Arcade not only compiles their respective trilogy, it also features a slew of graphical options, superior visual quality, customizable control scheme, the ability to save at anywhere anytime, plus save replays and share them online. It also adds new trial modes, online multi-player, and a jukebox where you can listen to the music in these games, including their unused tracks. These compilations also allows players ability to play each of the games' different regional versions, finally giving Western players the ability to play the original Japanese (albeit untranslated) version of <em>Bare Knuckle III</em>. The downside with the <em>Golden Axe</em> collection is that it uses the arcade version of the first game instead of the enhanced Genesis port.
</li><li> The HD re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuardianHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuardianHeroes">Guardian Heroes</a></em> on Xbox LIVE Arcade presents the game in widescreen, features enhanced HD visuals, redrawn character artwork, re-worked voice-overs, new sound effects, a revised script, redesigned gameplay mechanics, updated A.I., online multi-player, and expanded Versus Mode to twelve players. The game also give players the option of playing the game with the original gameplay mechanics and Sega Saturn visuals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>
<ul><li> The New 3DS port, <em>Hyrule Warriors Legends</em>, manages to pack in all of the missions of the original, plus all of the DLC characters and maps (with tweaks to specific missions and unlock placement to give it its own identity). In addition, the game adds new characters (including several fan favorites, like Skull Kid and Tetra) and a story mode for them, an indicator to show what subweapon can interrupt an enemy's attacks, and tweaks to the Giant Boss fights to make fighting them less onerous. The version on the old 3DS is a pretty problematic port however...
</li><li> The Switch port, subtitled <em>Definitive Edition</em>, included the improvements of <em>Legends</em>, took advantage of the hardware upgrade, and rebalanced Adventure Mode's grading system.

<ul><li> <em>Virtua Racing Deluxe</em>, the 32X port of <em>Virtua Racing</em>, doesn't t have graphics quite as good as the arcade original, but it does have three different cars (rather than just one), and five tracks rather than three. It plays rather closely to the arcade original, and much more smoothly than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MegaDrive">Mega Drive</a> port. Also worth noting about <em>Virtua Racing Deluxe</em> is that it is one of the first console racing games to feature rendered damage on one's car.
</li><li> The <em>SEGA AGES</em> port on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> by M2 quickly gained a reputation as being the most accurate port of the game. It bumps the visuals up to 60 FPS from the original 30 while remaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort">faithful to the original</a>, has an 8-player multiplayer mode (a first for console versions of the game), and features a replay mode designed after the live feed from the arcade version.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> port of <em>Cruis'n World</em> is missing the ability to murder wildlife, but it's graphically closer to the arcade original than the Nintendo 64 version of <em>Cruis'n USA</em> was to its arcade version. On top of that, the developers at Eurocom also added circuit tracks, turbo boost, more cars, and four-player multiplayer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</a></em> on the Nintendo DS used a custom engine to include most of the content of the console versions while running at a smooth framerate on the handheld, creating a faithful port that sacrifices little and provides an excellent portable alternative.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a></em>'s PC port. While the port for the first ASR was pretty watered-down (no online play, no controller support, no DLC), SUMO knew they had to make up for it by making a fantastic PC port of the sequel. Some of the advantages that the PC version has over the console/handheld versions are: Full 60FPS and 1080p resolution, more detail in the shading and character models (including face and eye animations!), five exclusive characters (three of which are Pyro, Heavy, and Spy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, who all take up one character slot and take turns driving on different terrains), and it gets updated on a regular basis, meaning it has less glitches than the console versions (although online mode is still very buggy). Additionally, the PC version has had a steady stream of DLC characters added to the roster while the console versions have had nothing beyond the initial Metal Sonic and OutRun Beach Bonus Pack thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InitialDArcadeStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InitialDArcadeStage">Initial D Arcade Stage</a> Version 2</em> received a port to the PlayStation 2 known as <em>Initial D Special Stage</em>. Not only does it retain the slick 60 frames per second of the arcade game (and doesn't drain your quarters!), it also includes an additional story mode based off the original manga containing <em>fifty</em> races and challenges spanned across three characters, along with a few new race courses that would later be merged back into the main arcade series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a> Deluxe</em> is port from the Wii U version to the Switch. The port includes all of the characters from the DLC packs plus a few new ones like Bowser Jr. and the Inklings from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>, several new battle modes (many being classics like the classic free for all Balloon Battle in an enclosed arena, Shine Thief, and Bob-omb Blast), all the tracks from the previous DLC packs, several gameplay tweaks like the third level of boost, updated AI, significant balancing changes, and a native 1080p resolution when in docked mode (native 720p for handheld mode, which was still an improvement over the dynamic resolution of the Wii U version). The port also brings back the double item box mechanic from <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</em> to allow players to hold two items at once. The game also brings back the Boo item, which last appeared in <em>Mario Kart DS</em> (which steals another player's item and makes the user turn invisible), while Battle Mode gets an exclusive item in the form of the Feather (which is used to make a big jump instantly) from the first installment.
</li><li> <em>FAST RMX</em> has everything <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FASTRacingLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FASTRacingLeague">FAST Racing</a> NEO</em> has to offer, including its DLC, in a single purchase, on the Switch, allowing you to not only play it on the go, but also in local wireless multiplayer mode.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun">OutRun</a></em> reproduces the 1986 arcade original's graphics, quirks and all, while also adding 3D effects and a widescreen mode, running at a silky-smooth 60 frames per second, twice that of the original. It also adds two new music tracks, <em>Cruising Line</em> and <em>Camino a Mi Amor</em> that so faithfully capture the sound and spirit of the three existing tracks that they could easily have been cut tracks from the original game. To round it off, there are unlockable upgrades for the car, awarded for completing each of the five endings, enhancing the speed, control and handling, as well as changing the car's paint job.
<ul><li> The unofficial, reverse-engineered PC port of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun">OutRun</a></em> arcade engine, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://reassembler.blogspot.co.uk/p/cannonball-open-source-outrun-engine.html">Cannonball<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, faithfully reproduces the arcade original while adding graphical upgrades (including a higher-resolution display), a widescreen mode, and a comprehensive track editor. A promised future addition to the track editor will even allow your custom tracks to be played on the original arcade game!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive">Test Drive</a></em>: <em>Le Mans</em> for the Dreamcast. <a class="urllink" href="https://planetdc.segaretro.org/games/reviews/testdrivelemans/index.html">Rumor says<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the publisher only wanted a straight port of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> game, but the developers were impressed by the system and insisted on a total revamp to fully use its power.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai"> Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</a></em>: Despite the lack of the original soundtracks, the menus and cutscenes not being expanded to widescreen, and the exclusion of <em>Budokai 2</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> ports of the first and third installments have been touched up pretty nicely in other areas. The graphics pop with the upgrade to HD and the framerate is increased to 60fps. <em>Budokai 1</em> also has a quality of life improvement, gameplay-wise, in that the second player can finally choose the "Custom" option for their chosen character's moveset in the versus mode, which was oddly left out of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> releases. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-releases</a> are also based on the original Japanese PlayStation 2/GameCube releases, which means the extra costumes in <em>Budokai 3</em>, which were initially left out for a later re-release internationally are in the game's code and are still unlockable with the same codes as they were originally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtuaFighter">Virtua Fighter</a></em> for Sega 32X, despite greatly downgraded visuals which made the characters look like they were made of wooden blocks, is considered a fan-favorite of the game, and for good reason. It retains all characters and their move sets from the arcade original, cool music very similar to the arcade edition, arcade-perfect control and features ranking and tournament modes, as well as other options not featured in other releases. This game alone is a reason to buy a 32X.
</li><li> The Dreamcast port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">SoulCalibur</a></em>. Like <em>SoulEdge</em>, the first <em>Soul Calibur</em> arcade game was based on the original PlayStation hardware, which means the Dreamcast port ended up being visually far superior to it (as in the greatest-looking console game ever at release plus its copious extra modes).
</li><li> The Mega Drive/Genesis version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em> may have been less impressive graphically due to the system's limited color palette, but some of the music (composed by Matt Furniss) was quite different from its arcade counterpart, and (in many people's opinion) for the better. Not to mention the blood code.
</li><li> Most fighting games ported to the original Game Boy tended to not play anything like their console or arcade brethren, due to choppy framerates and/or unresponsive controls because of developers trying to emulate the look of the game rather than replicating the gameplay, but some managed to stand out.
<ul><li> For the GB port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em>, the developers obviously had gameplay in mind first and foremost; they did this by downscaling the characters enough to where you could still make distinctions on who they are without hampering the frame-rate, resulting in fluid, responsive gameplay that played very close to the original version (with the exception of a couple of cut characters and streamlined controls). It helped that the team that worked on the GB version were comprised of programmers who had worked on the arcade and SNES ports, instead of Nintendo handing the job to a third party. Hands-down to one of the best fighting game on the green-screen original GB.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> port is outstanding. While the main games could be seen as a failed franchise, the Game Boy port really deserves more attention, as it is easily one of the best fighting-games the Game Boy has. It even managed to get the <em>Ring Out</em> feature on a 2D game without breaking it.
</li><li> The Game Boy port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Samurai Shodown</a></em> changed the characters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> versions, much as with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a></em>, allowing for the same wide-open screen for leaping about as the original and all of the original moves. They also added in several secret characters such as the referee and the messenger long before the arcade ports allowed them. And gave some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">kick-ass themes</a> for the characters who originally had atmospheric noises for their stages.
</li><li> The Game Boy version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatII">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> was a great handheld fighter that played as well as <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> could be on a Game Boy, and quite a surprise after looking at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> that was the original <em>Mortal Kombat</em> on Game Boy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> series:
<ul><li> A minor example is the SNES version of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em>. Although the character sprites were smaller and less animated, they kept the controls just as tight, and were even able to add the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> and alternate colors of <em>Champion Edition</em> though a code. Some of the ending artwork were also improved, most notably Eliza (Ken's girlfriend) actually resembles a human being for once.
</li><li> The early <em>Street Fighter</em> games had a rocky history of being ported to MS-DOS, but the DOS port of <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo</em> by Eurocom was a step in the right direction. On top of being actually playable, it has visuals on par with the arcade version at the expense of having the game screen zoomed in, and uses six buttons for attacks instead of two buttons found in most early DOS fighting games. The DOS version came in two versions: a floppy version with MIDI-quality music and a CD version with remixed music and better keyboard support.
</li><li> The Sega Saturn version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em>, a.k.a. <em>Street Fighter Zero 3</em>, is widely regarded as the best, even superior to the CPS-2 original. It requires a 4MB RAM cart, but has all of its animation intact, lots of extra game modes, extra characters like Guile, and isn't extremely prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">Loads and Loads of Loading</a> for a CD-based console beyond the initial loading screen. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">it never left Japan</a>. PlayStation owners however got an extremely polished port, across ALL regions. The downside was the Loads and Loads of Loading, which loads in between <em>everything</em>, ruining the pace compared to arcade version.
</li><li> Unsurprisingly, the Dreamcast port of <em>Alpha 3</em> contains the same features and polish as the Saturn version AND it was released outside of Japan.
</li><li> The Playstation 4 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a></em> started life as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a>, but as of Patch 1.04, it got elevated to this status, having all the positives of the Xbox 360 version and running like the PC version on the highest settings. It even eclipsed said Xbox 360 version in the tournament scene.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dreamcast port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomClashOfTheSuperheroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomClashOfTheSuperheroes">Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of the Superheroes</a></em>. It was a full and complete port of the arcade original, with all the animation, characters, endings, codes, and gameplay intact. As far as game modes, it only adds training and survival, but has a number of small, somewhat subtle additions that really add up. Primarily the fact that by fighting the secret characters in the arcade mode, you can unlock them for use without the rather complex codes from the arcade (which still work here, by the way). Unlocking them all allows the player to actually use Onslaught in a separate game mode&mdash;thus giving players the chance to use him while keeping him out of the game proper. The only thing missing is the PlayStation version's 'secret' Mega Man with the Magnetic Shockwave.
</li><li> <em>Cyber Troopers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VirtualOn">Virtual-ON</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxLiveArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxLiveArcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> port of <em>Virtual-ON: Oratorio Tangram Ver.5.66</em> has optional HD visuals, tutorials for beginners, and the default control scheme works quite well with the Xbox 360 controller. It also has online play through Xbox LIVE and the color edit feature seen in the Dreamcast version.
</li><li> The PlayStation 2 port of <em>Virtual-ON: Operation Moongate</em> has updated visuals and runs more fluidly than the original (up until the Japan-only HD re-release), improved sound quality, and added a slew of extra modes to play around with, including one where you can play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">chibi versions</a> of the Virtuaroids and play as the final boss. Sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">nobody outside of Japan got this version</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The PlayStation version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PsychicForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PsychicForce">Psychic Force 2012</a></em>, titled <em>Psychic Force 2</em>, despite having downgraded visuals from the arcade and Dreamcast version, it features new modes to play around with, including a Psy Expand mode that features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements">RPG Elements</a> that allows players to customize each characters' moveset, and restored Sonia, Brad, and Genma as playable characters. Like the PlayStation port of its predecessor, <em>Psychic Force 2012</em> also got an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeThemeSong">Anime Theme Song</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MwMaBkbKDc">opening<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by Hironobu Kageyama, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JAMProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JAMProject">JAM Project</a>'s founding members. Although never released in North America, it did however see an English release in PAL territories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> got a much better port on PC, having the characters' move-list available from the get-go (although this was later rectified in the console versions), online lobbies, more frequent updates than the console versions, and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">straight from the developers' mouths</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Skullgirls/status/313027984904822784">support for every USB controller imaginable<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Testing it out with more obscure controllers (including those unsuited for fighters, let alone six button ones) shows that they weren't lying, either.
</li><li> The Model2 Collection re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheFighters">Sonic the Fighters</a></em> has enhanced visuals for 1080p, online multi-player, and undummied three of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> characters that where only accessible through hacking. The undummied characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightingVipers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FightingVipers">Honey</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Cat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">Metal Sonic</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Dr. Robotnik</a> (in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>); the latter two of the three are only playable through multi-player through. You can even press the triggers of your controller to listen to the game's music at the main menu, including the unused tracks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Asuka120Percent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Asuka120Percent">Asuka 120%</a></em> series saw several releases on a couple of consoles and computer systems, but many consider <em>Asuka 120% BURNING Fest. Limited</em> on Sega Saturn the best in the series. It features much better visuals, larger hand-drawn sprites, smoother animations, remixed CD-quality music from the PC Engine version, and faster and refined gameplay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldHeroes">World Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The SNES version of <em>World Heroes 2</em>. The game has most of the graphics intact. A soundtrack that is close to the original in quality. All of the characters are select able. It comes with both the arcade and arena modes. And is overall 85% accurate to the original Neo-Geo version.
</li><li> Unlike other fighting games that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">suffered</a> when converted to the Neo Geo CD, the series took the translation well. The game's comparatively modest megabyte count made for reasonable loading times and the obligatory arranged soundtracks were very well done. Furthermore, <em>2</em> and <em>Perfect</em> received extra content: the former added the ability to play as Neo Dio through a cheat code, while the later added a mode that allowed the player to select bosses Son Goku and Neo Dio without having to input a cheat code to play as them, and added the ability to play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">Zeus</a> in VS mode.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First-Person Shooter&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Saturn</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI">Quake</a></em> was surprisingly competent considering the Saturn's notorious handicap with 3D, featuring all of the content of the original version and much more accurate level geometry than the concurrent Nintendo 64 port. It also has four secret levels not found in any other versions. Part of what makes it such a good port is that it's not even using the original <em>Quake</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameEngine">engine</a> - the game was actually based on Lobotomy Software's own Slavedriver engine, also used in <em>PowerSlave</em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem">Duke Nukem</a> 3D</em> port, which could take proper advantage of the Saturn's specs.
</li><li> The PlayStation and Saturn version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerSlave">PowerSlave</a></em> (<em>Exhumed</em> and <em>Seireki 1999: Pharaoh no Fukkatsu</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">in Europe and Japan</a>, respectively). Although the various version were released together, development started on the PC using the Build engine, best known for powering <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em>. (Odd, isn't it? The version of Build used for PC <em>PowerSlave</em> is even older than that used for <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> despite releasing after, at that.) Lobotomy then decided to try their luck on consoles, but upon realizing that a straight port was impossible, they developed the Slavedriver engine and ended up making practically another game. While PC <em>PowerSlave</em> is forgettable and has overly long, boring levels, console <em>PowerSlave</em> is one of the best early console FPSes, and loses some nicer textures in exchange for faster and smoother gameplay, full 3D movement, and open-ended levels with new weapons and abilities to discover in order to advance, predating <em>Metroid Prime</em> by over half a decade.
</li><li> <em>Hard Rock Cab</em>, the PlayStation port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quarantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quarantine">Quarantine</a></em>, proves that the PS1 was indeed capable of running 2D games well: it loads all area sprites in one loading session - without any quality drops - and runs with no "seemingly obvious" lag. This port requires only one memory card slot for five in-game save slots, and you can save everywhere, all on half the memory required by the DOS version. Unfortunately, this port has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never been released outside of Japan.</a>
</li><li> The versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">its sequel</a> was re-released on the Wii as part of the <em>New Play Control!</em> line of Wii re-releases in Japan and included as part of the <em>Metroid Prime Trilogy</em> released elsewhere. Both games had some extra lighting and bloom effects added, 16:9 widescreen presentation, slightly improved textures, doors loaded faster, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> feature that retains your logbook entries in subsequent playthroughs, and <em>Corruption</em>-style New Play Control that works beautifully. All of this on one disk only and slightly more expensive than <em>Corruption</em> on its own (until was it re-released through the Wii U's eShop channel, where it is sold in a much cheaper price). The only drawback was that some visual effects had to be removed due to the particle effects on Samus' arm cannon not being programmed to move with the Wii Remote, and the doors in <em>Corruption</em> took longer to load but the latter was fixed for the digital re-release.
</li><li> <em>The Orange Box</em> for Xbox 360 did this to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> and <em>Episode One</em>, bringing the graphical improvements of the shiny new engine to their old games without a hitch. This was the same case for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half-Life</a></em>, with higher resolution models, an entirely new story mode designed for co-op called Decay, a helpful targeting system, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ability to play as a Vortigaunt</span> and a two-player deathmatch mode with most of the original maps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>:
<ul><li> The PlayStation version may have replaced the memorable soundtrack with ambient music, but it also had plenty of extra levels, tons of new colored lighting effects which were pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>, and even added some of the <em>Doom II</em> monsters into the <em>Ultimate Doom</em> levels if you set the difficulty to Ultra-Violence. The same treatment was also given for the PlayStation version of <em>Final Doom</em> that also included levels from <em>Master Levels for Doom II</em>.
</li><li> The Xbox versions of <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom II</em> included in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a>: Limited Collecter's Edition</em> and <em>Resurrection of Evil</em> are very faithful console ports of the original PC version with an extra secret level added to each game, but has some rare game-breaking bugs. The HD version on Xbox LIVE Arcade, included <em>Doom 3: BFG Edition</em>, and the <em>Doom Classic Complete</em> compilation on PlayStation Network presents the classic <em>Doom</em> games in a higher native resolution, features higher quality music, online multi-player, and a new "No Rest for the Living" episode for <em>Doom II</em>. However the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein">Wolfenstein</a></em> levels were censored and the red medical crosses were removed in the HD re-releases.
</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> isn't as technically proficient as the other versions due to the weaker hardware, with it having been downgraded from 60FPS at 1080p to 30FPS at 720p, the game still runs a lot better than one would expect it on the system, and it has all of the DLC. The only content that was cut was the Snapmap feature. Most reviews already hail it as a solid version of the game.
</li><li> The 2019 Unity ports of the original two games for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Android and iOS were originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">rather poor conversions</a>, including a messed-up aspect ratio (somewhere between 4:3 and 16:9, stretching the overall image), poor-quality music and sound effects, and most infamously a mandatory login for the "Slayer's Club" features. After the patches, it has gone from one of the worst ports of the classic games ever to being almost comparable to playing the original games on a source port: displaying the visuals and playing sounds properly, bumping resolution up to 640x400 with the frame-rate raised to 60 FPS, added rumble support for controllers, a weapon carousel to help with weapon management on controller, and official add-ons that includes both halves of <em>Final Doom</em> for both games, the <em>No Rest for the Living</em> episode for <em>Doom II</em> from the original XBLA port, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SIGIL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SIGIL">SIGIL</a></em> for <em>Doom I</em>, along with other various curated WADs being released on top of free content updates as well. The 2019 version would later be re-released on PC as well through Bethesea.net and later Steam, with the ability to side-load custom WADs compatible with the new re-release for the PC and mobile versions. Another update for this suite of ports went even further by introducing official widescreen 16:9 presentation with the option to play in 4:3 like in the original, gyro motion controls for controllers that supported it, variable frame-rate options, toggleable V-sync, a revamped deathmatch multiplayer, a new Ultra-Violence+ difficulty, and DeHackEd mod support along with other quality-of-life improvements. The only major downside is the multiplayer features are local-only, unless you're playing the Steam version, which can workaround this by using Steam's Remote Play feature to stream the game with other players.
</li><li> The 2020 KEX Engine re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom64">Doom 64</a></em> for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Switch is easily the best version of the game. The original game is presented in full, with the original visuals perfectly recreated in HD widescreen, including the N64's unique solution to texture filtering, although you can opt to disable texture filtering altogether to give the game a look akin to the first two games. The frame-rate has been greatly increased (originally 30 FPS with dips in performance, now a locked 60 FPS on consoles and able to achieve up to <strong>1000 FPS</strong> on PC, although it could be capped to 30 FPS like in the original), various options including a FOV slider and anti-aliasing options, gyroscope aiming on Switch, rumble support for controllers (a first for the KEX Engine), and seven brand-new levels, including one that ties the events of the game with those of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal">Doom Eternal</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The PC version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a> 2</em> had higher-resolution graphics and better music than the original Nintendo 64 version, plus the ability to save anywhere, although some of the music was cut short to fit the Red Book space on the CD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEyeWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEyeWii">GoldenEye</a> Reloaded</em> for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is basically an enhanced port of the Wii version in high resolution and better textures, along with more content.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">didn't have the best PC port</a>. Realizing that they didn't do that good of a job, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GearboxSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GearboxSoftware">Gearbox Software</a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.borderlands2.com/loveletter/?x">Claptrap<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> responded to PC players that they would get a better port for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">second game</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://pcgamingwiki.com/images/5/5a/Borderlands_2_-_video_settings.png">They lived up to everything on the list and more, as one can tell.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> is a substantial upgrade to the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> game. Not only does the remake have an HD veneer with a consistently smooth frame rate, the game's multiplayer components include online play and weapons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em>.

It contains ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em> being made available as DLC later on. All games run at 1080p with 60fps (4K on the One X) came with local and online multiplayer (particularly notable with the first two, as <em>Combat Evolved</em> didn't ship with Xbox Live and <em>Halo 2</em>'s servers were long dead) and came with the anniversary edition of <em>Combat Evolved</em> (read: a major, optional visual overhaul) and an anniversary edition of <em>2</em> created for the collection. There was only one major problem with the collection - it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">really,</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">really</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">buggy</a> on release, and the online matchmaking effectively didn't work. It took tons of patches for it to get everything to work to an acceptable level - the big "everything works now, guys" patch came out in 2018, four years after the initial release.

<ul><li> The original arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gauntlet">Gauntlet</a></em> was a coin-drinking machine that spawned random levels endlessly, including some that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">impossible to complete due to the placement of walls and items</a>, until the player ran out of money or gave up. The NES port replaced this with 100 pre-made levels and a password system. (Of course, the game was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">so ridiculously difficult that almost nobody made it to the end anyway.</a>)

<ul><li> Many ports actually managed to improve on the music from the original version, due to coding it for a different sound chip &mdash; even if the actual game engine was not as good. Examples:
<ul><li> Any port for which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/TimAndGeoffFollin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/TimAndGeoffFollin">the Follin brothers</a> did sound programming (e.g., <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a></em> for C64 and Amiga).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em> for the NES is another such port. Despite being on a more primitive sound chip, the music was faster-paced and generally more intense than the arcade version.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Mega Drive/Genesis</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings">Lemmings</a></em> arguably has a much more exciting soundtrack than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> original.
</li><li> As mentioned below, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> on PC and Sega CD's <em>Earthworm Jim: Special Edition</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BombJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BombJack">Bomb Jack</a></em> definitely qualifies. (Although the music is switched off by default for some crazy reason.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MontyMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MontyMole">Monty on the Run</a></em>, the memorable theme by Robin Hubbard was added to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmstradCPC">Amstrad CPC</a> versions; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> original was a 48K game with no music during gameplay.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManTheWilyWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManTheWilyWars">Mega Man: The Wily Wars</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> took the original three NES games, updated them with 16-bit graphics and sound, beefed up the difficulty, added a save feature for all three of the games, and, as a bonus, added an all-new game, <em>Wily Tower</em>, as an unlockable.
</li><li> The <em>Complete Works</em> series of enhanced ports for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> took the first six NES games and not only gave players the ability to play the original versions of these games for those that missed out the first time around, but also featured a new Navi Mode which gave these games remixed music, real-time weapon switching instead of having to use the pause menu to switch out weapons, a Mission Mode that rewards players with items to power-up Mega Man, selectable difficulty levels, a huge database of characters and enemies featured in each game, memory card saves as well as passwords, a revised HUD and menu system, and a hint system to help newcomers. These ports also fixed the slowdown and sprite-flickering that occurred in the original NES versions of these games. Those with a PocketStation can play mini-games on it to power up Mega Man's <em>and</em> the Robot Masters' stats to make them even stronger. Unfortunately, these ports never got a release outside of Japan until 2011 when they were re-released for PlayStation Network in North America but only for the first four games (getting <em>5</em> and <em>6</em> will require going through some hoops to import them) which are untranslated. Although the <em>Mega Man Anniversary Collection</em> (PS2, GC, Xbox) has a few of the features of the <em>Complete Works</em> series as well as including other games from the series, each of version of this collection has porting problems of their own and misses many of the extra features, and the later <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em> (PS4, XO, 3DS, NS, PC) only contains the original NES version of these games and not their enhanced Navi Mode.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a>, and PC ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX3">Mega Man X3</a></em> enhanced the game with rockin' CD-quality music, a save feature, and anime cutscenes sandwiched in-between. The only issue was the addition of loading times, which were eradicated in the <em>X Collection</em> port of <em>X3</em>.
</li><li> Capcom probably got the hint they screwed up <em>bad</em> when KOKO Capcom, Capcom's South Korean subsidiary, handled the Korean-only PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX7">Mega Man X7</a></em>, was likely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8">Mega Man X8</a></em>'s PC port turned out much better than its predecessor. Unlike <em>X7</em>, <em>X8</em> was far better programmed and available in multiple languages (depending on which release you obtained, however). It also has higher resolutions settings (up to 1280&times;1024 although hacks can make it higher), mouse support for menus, <em>and</em> supports gamepad (particularly DirectInput controllers). Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">this version never hit American shores</a>.
</li><li> The versions of <em>Mega Man X7</em> and <em>X8</em> included in <em>Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2</em> saw some improvements, which drastically cut down the loading times from their previous PS2 and PC releases, and bumps up the visuals to HD standards, giving these games better picture clarity. Unlike their previous PC releases, their <em>Legacy Collection 2</em> ports are also available internationally for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
</li><li> The <em>Mega Man Zero Collection</em> for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Zero</a></em> series introduces an "Easy Scenario Mode" that makes the games easier for beginners while being separate from individual games in the collection for those that prefer the original difficulty. It also fixes the translation errors, adds the ability to use the Y and X buttons of the DS, improves the music quality over their original GBA release, brought over the Japan-only e-Reader feature of <em>Rockman Zero 3</em> into the international versions, and a slew of unlockable artwork. The 2020 <em>Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection</em> not only retained many of the improvements from the previous collection, but also adds a Save-Assist feature that implements checkpoints at key areas throughout the games without penalties, the ability to play the western and Japanese versions of each game, and a Music Player featuring music from both <em>Zero</em> and <em>ZX</em> series. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a></em> series in this collection also gained the benefit of multiple screen layouts for the <em>ZX</em> series' dual screens, remastered FMVs, and the option to hear the original uncompressed voice-overs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureStrikerGunvolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureStrikerGunvolt">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a>: Striker Pack</em> for the Nintendo Switch is easily the definitive versions of both games as features HD event graphics, portraits, and skill cut-ins, runs at 60 FPS, bundles all DLCs for <em>Azure Striker Gunvolt 2</em>, backports many of the improvements from the sequel into the first game, includes the new Easy and Hard modes from the Steam port, and redesigns the menu and UI to take advantage of a single screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroEnterTheDragonfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroEnterTheDragonfly">Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly</a></em> was a disaster on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> (painfully slow frame rates/loading sequences, game-breaking glitches, etc.), but the developers fixed most of the technical issues when porting to the GameCube.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</a></em> was let down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">ridiculous loading times</a> on the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> versions cut them significantly. The Xbox port also adds a few graphical and sound enhancements such as fur textures for Crash and Coco and properly looped music while the GameCube port has GBA connectivity to unlock an extra mini-game. The only drawbacks are that both versions lack the original track for Medieval Madness for some reason (playing The Gauntlet's theme instead), and the GCN port in particular has a few graphical glitches. Some time later, the PlayStation 2 version itself had the loading times shortened for its Greatest Hits/Platinum release, as well.
</li><li> In Japan, <em>Akumajou Dracula</em> (the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">Castlevania</a></em>) was re-released on a cartridge (rather than floppy disks) in 1993. This version included an Easy Mode, in which Simon starts with more hearts, lives, and time, takes less damage, doesn't get knocked back, and keeps his Double/Triple Shot items when changing weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia">Prince of Persia</a></em> on the SNES blew the original home computer ports out of the water, with incredibly good background music (most of the home computer versions had none!), improved graphics, a password-based continue system, and added levels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">The sequel, on the other hand, was farmed out to a much worse developer.</a>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC98" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PC98">PC-98</a> version, though a straight port, was such a graphical improvement that Jordan Mechner was impressed. Most subsequent ports would follow it in putting a turban and vest on the Prince's sprite and making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> a row of potions instead of a row of triangles.
</li><li> Like the SNES version, the Mega Drive version featured background music (unfortunately not for the US version), added passwords, and upgraded graphics. It didn't have extra levels, but it had the most impressive graphics out of all ports, with gorgeous level art and cutscenes, and a lot of extra detail in the animations and level art.
</li><li> The Mega CD version featured revamped graphics, background music, a save system, an extra boss battle with the Vizer, and animated cutscenes.
</li></ul></li><li> Capcom often did this if they realized a straight port would end up a disaster. The NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Strider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Strider">Strider</a></em> is a worthy game even compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StriderArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StriderArcade">Arcade version</a> by virtue of <em>not</em> being a port at all. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformulatedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformulatedGame">a separate game using many of the same themes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText">a story based on the original manga</a>. Only control issues keep it from being a great game.
<ul><li> Similarly, the NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a></em> completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">displaced</a> the arcade original, which was relatively mediocre.
</li><li> The SNES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Area88">U.N. Squadron</a></em> goes from the linear arcade game to a deep map-based campaign with branching missions, side missions (enemy supply convoys and attacking bombers), and a plane and item shop that let you match any pilot with all the jets from the original and about twice as much besides.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis">Valis</a>: The Legend of a Fantasm Soldier</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TurboGrafx16">PC Engine Super CD</a> was a remake of the original game that had been remade for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Mega Drive</a> not long before. Not only does the PC Engine version have longer cutscenes and better colors, it avoids the hit detection and frame rate problems that plagued the Mega Drive version.
</li><li> The SNES port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChuckRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChuckRock">Chuck Rock</a></em> has more colors, multi-layer parallax scrolling backgrounds, and additional sound effects over other versions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker: Live and Reloaded</a></em> is a bit of a mixed bag. While the graphics were highly improved, a lot of the bad language was censored, which is interesting given that the original was a Nintendo 64 game, and <em>Live and Reloaded</em> was for the Xbox.
<ul><li> Fans of the original's multiplayer modes (which are widely well received, even being compared on several occasions to that of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em>) were for the most part disappointed with <em>Live and Reloaded</em>'s (now defunct because of server shutdown) multiplayer, becoming a more generic third-person shooter and losing a lot of the charm of the original.
</li><li> There are actually fixes to the gameplay of the original hidden in this version that until a video uploaded in 2017 have shown these changes were unheard of up to now. Whether its adding a crosshair to the ranged weapons, tweaking the difficulty in the infamous "It's War" chapter, refining the controls in the hoverboard sections, changing the shooting gameplay to a modern two stick 3rd person shooter layout, having a longer breath meter underwater and various smaller changes that make the gameplay smoother and iron out kinks caused by the limitations of the N64 controller, Live and Reloaded despite losing the coarse language might end up being the best version of Conker to play nowadays from a gameplay standpoint.

</li></ul></li><li> While the obscure PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a> 1 &amp; 2</em> didn't do much on the gameplay side (and increased loading times for most machines at the time), the graphics were enhanced along with Red Book audio music, which meant the game discs could be played in a music CD player, and the sound team took advantage of the higher quality. Anything But Tangerines (the first level from the second game) gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">special mention</a>.
<ul><li> There are <em>two</em> PC ports &mdash; an MS-DOS port published by Interplay, and a Windows 95 port published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotCom">GOG.com</a> is selling the Interplay DOS version. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/earthwormjim/earthwormjim.htm">Hardcore Gaming 101<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> notes that there are level and graphical differences between the two, but both have the same Red Book soundtrack.
</li><li> In lieu of the PC ports, there's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a>-exclusive <em>Earthworm Jim: Special Edition</em>, with Red Book audio for the music, much smoother animations than in the SNES port, and the most levels you'll find of any console version of the game, including the exclusive "Big Bruty" level.
</li><li> The Sega Saturn and PlayStation versions of <em>Earthworm Jim 2</em> are a good example of this. They have the same Red Book audio of the Windows and DOS versions, very polished and professional-looking graphics (more so on the Sega Saturn), and are slightly different and have some minor things added to the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Funnily enough, <em>Disney's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em> backport.

</li><li> The Sega Genesis version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLostVikings">The Lost Vikings</a></em> added five new levels, an intro cutscene for each world, three-player simultaneous co-op, and an entirely new tune for the Factory level.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14cy7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14cy7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14cy7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The SNES version reuses the intro sequence's music for the Wacky level. The Sega version adds an entirely different tune for the Factory level, and moves the SNES' Factory music to the Wacky level.</span>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic 2</a></em> got the same treatment, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> mode, expanded multiplayer and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a recreation of the infamous Hidden Palace Zone.</span>

The heavily compressed, 64-color animated cutscenes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> original were replaced with their full versions, it uses a brand new engine made by Christian "Taxman" Whitehead (which would also later be used for the mobile ports of the first two <em>Sonic</em> games) that fixed numerous bugs from the original version, features Tails as an unlockable playable character, an option to use the Genesis-style spin dash, and also an option to choose between American and Japanese soundtracks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> were ported to the Nintendo GameCube as <em>Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut</em> and <em>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</em>. The latter merely received extra two player content, but the former underwent a graphical overhaul, had bonus missions added, and included the ability to unlock the twelve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> Sonic games, as well as play as Metal Sonic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> on the PC is the definitive version of the game. Full 1080p visuals and runs on a slick 60FPS (and that is without mentioning the huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modding</a> possibilities). Unfortunately, there are drawbacks: If playing on a non-Xbox controller, Sonic will sometimes start stepping to the left by himself until you restart the game, it has graphical and framerate issues with some video cards that really shouldn't have such issues for the game (especially likely to be encountered in the liquid-heavy Chemical Plant stage), the system requirements were incredibly high when it was released requiring a top-of-the-line machine.
</li><li> While the graphics were downgraded due to the system not being as powerful as its competitors, as well as the framerate being halved, the Nintendo Switch version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a> is otherwise identical to the other versions, but also allows portable play. There are also some (relatively minor) bugfixes that the other versions don't have. Even more impressive is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming">the developers managed to cut down the filesize by more than half, from around 18GB to just 7GB, while leaving everything intact.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blackthorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blackthorne">Blackthorne</a></em> got a version for the Sega 32X about a year after the SNES and PC versions, which featured updated graphics and a new area.

And, to add to the confusion, a PlayStation 1 version of <em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> was released between the Dreamcast version and the PlayStation 2 version, only this version had only 800 lums, an exclusive minigame, several characters added, and several levels modified or removed altogether.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall">Super Monkey Ball</a></em> was originally an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Game</a> called <em>Monkey Ball</em>. It was ported to the Nintendo GameCube with some Party Games and Mini Games added on.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pitfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pitfall">Pitfall II: Lost Caverns</a></em> was ported from the Atari 2600 to both the Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 lines of computers, each development team came up with their own superior version of the game. The Commodore 64 team rebuilt the code from scratch and vastly improved the graphics, while the Atari 400/800 team reused the code from the 2600 version, then used the extra time waiting for the Commodore 64 team to finish to make an entire hidden second level that was <em>longer than the original game itself</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turrican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turrican">Turrican</a></em>, as originally created by Manfred Trenz for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a>, didn't have much of a soundtrack, since most levels took up too much memory to allow for music. It was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a> port, with enhanced graphics and a new soundtrack by Chris Huelsbeck, that made the game legendary. (<em>Turrican II</em> for the Amiga was developed alongside Trenz's C64 version, and was actually released first.)
</li><li> The PlayStation version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMania">Mickey Mania</a></em>, entitled <em>Mickey's Wild Adventure</em>, took the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> version, greatly enhanced the graphics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">amped up the difficulty</a>, and added another new stage, this one having Mickey escaping from a pursuing Willie the Giant.

<ul><li> <em>Super Mario All-Stars</em> is a massive visual and sound overhaul of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em>, and the previously Japan-exclusive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosTheLostLevels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a></em>. All the games have their visual styles and sounds updated to match the power that the Super NES had, and the physics in all the games were slightly tweaked. A second edition of <em>All-Stars</em> was released, which included <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> and gave Luigi distinct sprites.

All 4 added additional sounds and new multiplayer content in the form of a remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros">Mario Bros.</a></em>. <em>Yoshi's Island</em> added bonus stages. <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> added the ability to scan e-Reader bonus stages (all of which were bundled with the game when it received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> release, including stages that were previously Japan-only). <em>Super Mario World</em> has Dragon Coins in the Castles and Fortresses and gave Luigi his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">trademark physics</a>. <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> also has a different World 3 boss.

</li><li> Logistics surrounding how the release was handled aside, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em> is the definitive way to play the game, thanks to 1080p visuals and significantly improved load times. The new Funky Mode added to lower the difficulty also helps players frustrated by the difficulty enjoy the game more, but the technical improvements alone make it qualify for this.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2016 PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TyTheTasmanianTiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TyTheTasmanianTiger">TY the Tasmanian Tiger</a></em>, done by the original developers at Krome Studios, includes upgraded textures, realtime shadows, reflections and other post-processing effects, reprogrammed camera controls, the ability to use the Doomerang during levels, fixing bugs in the original 2002 release, better quality FMV and of course, a smooth 60FPS.
</li><li> The Genesis port of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SnowBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SnowBros">Snow Bros</a> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tengen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tengen">Tengen</a>.

The port came out almost <em>four years</em> after the console versions (due to Double Fine not being allowed to make a PC port until EA dropped publishing rights), but it was worth the wait. Due to the game being an RTS, it plays a <em>lot</em> better with a mouse + keyboard setup than it does with a controller. The lack of involvement from EA also means the port does not have the 99% completion glitch.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a> 2</em> was already highly popular on the PlayStation 2, but the Xbox 360 version gave the game not just a visual touch-up, but new guitar controllers, a host of new songs (and optional downloads as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>), and a rearranged song order (even though "Psychobilly Freakout" had no change in tier placing), among others. It also widened the allowable gap between frets for hammer-ons and pull-offs just enough to make songs that made heavy use of them tolerable.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> provides a backwards example. Usually games down-ported from the Xbox 360 to the PlayStation 2 are disasters with low frame rates, long loading times, ugly graphics etc. <em>Rock Band</em> looked like it would be no exception, given that 4 charts can scroll down the screen at once (a novelty at the time), with 4 characters rocking out in the background with more detail than they used in the Guitar Hero games. How did they pull it off? Well, they didn't. They compromised by removing the character editor completely and making a video file for every song of the pre-made characters rocking instead. At the price of having no choice of character (or editor), the game played smoothly with nearly identical graphics (in SD). A less-polished aspect is that the tour was removed and replaced with a simplified version (the same as the solo tour), although some people preferred this tour for having less menus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Beatmania">beatmania</a> IIDX 9th Style</em> was a porting disaster on its arcade version (and that's porting as in, porting to a new Windows-based engine from the PlayStation-derived "Twinkle" hardware used up to 8th Style) and was full of bugs. The PlayStation 2 version did not share any of these issues.

Unfortunately, it also suffered some regressions, some of them being a result of the GameCube's limitations: the music's quality was vastly inferior as Sega had to use a different sound engine and didn't do a great job of it,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4hapg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4hapg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4hapg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Dreamcast version used InVision Interactive's <a class="urllink" href="https://segaretro.org/CyberSound">CyberSound<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; there was no GameCube version of it, and InVision had gone out of business.</span> Pinta Quest was removed due to the lack of VMU (and the GC to GBA feature not being a good enough replacement, as the GBA doesn't retain data transferred from GC after being turned off), the lighting was downgraded, and there was no way of playing the game with the amazing picture quality of the Dreamcast's VGA output.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>: So much so that <em>Leifthrasir</em> easily outclasses the original game in numerous ways and most class it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Video Game Remake</a>. 1080p, 60 FPS, numerous amounts of new or redrawn artwork that makes the game even more gorgeous, and a complete overhaul of the battle system that transforms it from a slow-paced action game into a much faster hack-and-slash (or shoot-em-up in Mercedes' case). It even fixes numerous issues like streamlining the leveling and food systems to be far less obtuse and bloated, to the point of getting quick food safe rooms throughout areas to level mid-dungeon instead of leaving the whole dungeon to go chow down. And in case one prefers the original Odin Sphere setup? Classic Mode has all the original game design intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastRemnant">The Last Remnant</a></em> was a sorta-decent game on the Xbox 360. The PC port fixed a lot of the bugs, smoothed out crafting, and removed the hated "Leader" designation, which restricted players from using most of the most powerful characters.
</li><li> The original Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> was pretty good, but the American localization for the SNES suffered from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">bad translation</a>. The following ports improved upon it:
<ul><li> The GBA version (actually based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WonderSwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WonderSwan">WonderSwan</a> Color port) fixed the translation, but lengthened the lag between selecting a special ability or spell and using it, meaning that most fights were best handled through mashing "Attack" over and over. Features-wise, it added the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">put "removed" characters back into your party in the last part of the game</a>.
</li><li> The PSP version proves to be a port of a port (specifically, of the GBA version), but with greatly improved graphics, removed lag, a choice between the SNES and DS soundtracks, and a number of bug fixes. It lacks anything introduced to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">DS version</a> besides a few translation changes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Steam/smartphone version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> has been refined in just about every way. The graphics are much higher resolution than their native PS1 counterparts (albeit with backgrounds that are still the same), and the FMV cutscenes can now be skipped. In addition, Square Enix added several game boosters which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a>, including "all attacks hit the damage cap," "always in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Trance</a>," and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant">no encounters</a>." You even get the ability to reach the level cap instantly with a menu option. However, all of the game boosters are optional, so you can still play the normal way. Finally, there's a button that greatly increases the game speed while the game's clock still runs in real time, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">the insane "reach this one spot in less than 12 hours to get the Excalibur II" sidequest</a> a bit more feasible, as well as letting you breeze through anything you don't want to watch. In short, whether you want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory">Play the Game, Skip the Story</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnjoyTheStorySkipTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnjoyTheStorySkipTheGame">Enjoy the Story, Skip the Game</a>, there's something for you in this port.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>: In Japan, the original NES game received an MSX2 port in 1989. It suffered from (relatively brief) load times and a lack of smooth scrolling, and the Black Belt class was significantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a>, but it also featured improved graphics and sound. The PlayStation remake in <em>Final Fantasy Origins</em> updates the game with considerably better sounds and graphics, though suffers similar loading problems. This remake was later refined considerably in <em>Dawn of Souls</em> for the GBA: reducing loading times, allowing the player to save anywhere, and adding in 4 whole new dungeons complete with new enemies and having bosses from other Final Fantasy games. In turn, this port was taken to the PSP; the graphics were improved even more and another new dungeon was added, though many seem to prefer the GBA version due to it being on a more liked console and the PSP version's dungeon not being terribly memorable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em> both received HD remasters on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a>, with higher-quality character models, textures that were also bumped up in quality, and a completely remastered soundtrack. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> version boosted the visuals a bit further while also enabling players to switch between the remastered soundtrack and the original soundtrack. Finally, the two games were also ported to Steam with the same enhancements as their console counterparts and giving booster options such as max gil, learn all abilities, boost encounter rates (or turn them off entirely), boost game speed, and more. Most importantly, the Steam edition finally implements the ability to skip cutscenes, albeit only FMV ones. Many of these enhancements were carried ovder to the Xbox and Switch versions.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> HD port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> does a lot of the same things as the HD port of <em>X/X-2</em> and changes the game balance to make it easier. The PC version adds an increased framerate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and New Game Minus, the option to choose between 3 different versions of the soundtrack recorded over the years, and max license points and Gil. Most of these were carried over to the Xbox and Switch ports of the game, with the Xbox One X version also allowing you to increase the framerate to 60FPS.
</li><li> The DS version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> adds some new weapons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> sidequests, and an extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, which ties the game in with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>. It also keeps the anime-style cutscenes from the PlayStation port and polishes some game mechanics. The translation was also redone from its original Japanese, which removed some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyisms</a> and inaccuracies. It was also finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemadeForTheExport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemadeForTheExport">released in Europe</a>!
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersPirates">Sid Meier's Pirates!</a></em>, originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Commodore64">Commodore 64</a> game, got a huge graphics and music upgrade when it was ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Amiga">Amiga</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a>: Secret of the Inner Sanctum</em> on the Nintendo Entertainment System was far more playable than the original Apple II/PC versions.
</li><li> The PSP version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> is <em>Persona 3</em> with most of the gameplay elements of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> refined to perfection, and the ability to choose the gender of the main character. There's also a few new Social Links around, including a cameo by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">Ms. Kashiwagi</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>. Also, you now have full control over your party, like in <em>P4</em>.
</li><li> The first version of <em>Golvellius</em>, developed by Compile on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX">MSX</a>, was a nice game already (it's basically a Zelda clone with some neat elements added, like side-scrolling dungeons) but had extremely bland graphics and sound. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> remade it on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> with much better graphics, a completely new layout for dungeons and overworld, and some additions like mid-dungeon bosses. Compile took note and made the definitive version (often incorrectly referred as <em>Golvellius 2</em>) for the MSX2: different storyline, awesome intro and ending screens, graphics similar to the Master System version but less cartoonish, and yet another complete renewal of overworld and dungeons.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">MOTHER</a></em> portion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">MOTHER 1</a>+<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">2</a></em>. It took the myriad polishes and extra features of the English prototype, which was widely known as <em>EarthBound Zero</em> before it was officially released as <em>EarthBound Beginnings</em> in 2015 (simultaneously confirming said prototype's legitimacy over a decade before it was officially released to the public), polished its rough edges further, added more convenient controls in line with those of <em>EarthBound</em>, resulting in something of a superior product to both prior versions. The <em>EarthBound</em> portion, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">wasn't quite so lucky</a>. Clyde "Tomato" Mandelin, who helmed the fan translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>, translated the <em>Mother</em> portion of the game, though the lower quality of the <em>Mother 2</em>/<em>EarthBound</em> port is only half of why he didn't fully translate that part (the other half being <em>2</em>'s needlessly complicated text display system, which resembles a scripting language instead of being plain text).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FMTowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FMTowns">FM Towns</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em> added voice acting in both English and Japanese, as well as digital sound effects to replace the PC speaker sound effects of the original version.
</li><li> The PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> improved the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">much-despised</a> Mako tank sequences, giving you better control with a keyboard and mouse than you ever had with an Xbox controller. Depending on the speed of your system, it also decreases the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">Loads and Loads of Loading</a>. It's not without its flaws, though: On launch the game suffered several issues related to hardware and firmware variations. There's a rumor that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> only tested the port on one set of hardware and drivers. However performance is non-issue despite several apparently hard-coded slowdowns.
<ul><li> The PC port of the second and third game are increasingly better, with both having better visuals and optimized performance (to the point that graphical options are very small beyond resolution and very basic shadows, vsync, and film grain settings) than the first game while looking better, and despite Mass Effect 2 PC port was plagued by two jarring issues in which button prompts/tutorials not changing to mapped keys and default mouse acceleration/sensitivity issues (that can only be fixed by modifying a game file with external tools), Mass Effect 3 PC port fixes those two issues.

When it was ported to a modern Windows platform, it was vastly improved into version 2.0, which added level gains, multi-classed characters, characters with two classes, a huge catalog of monsters, non-spell class abilities, spells through 4th level, and monster-vs-monster combat.
</li><li> The PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> features new weapons, new enemies, new fighting styles, a harder difficulty setting, and improved AI.
<ul><li> Although Monk Zeng was the Collector's Edition exclusive character on Xbox (and later downloadable for running on Xbox 360).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em> was originally released on the Xbox 360 and then ported to the PlayStation 3 with extra playable characters, more plot, and additional costumes for the characters.
</li><li> The Wonderswan port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiToshiSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiToshiSaga">Makai Toshi Saga</a></em> (known overseas as <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a> Legend</em>) fixed many issues that plagued the original Game Boy release, including bugs and interface issues that made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> a practical necessity in the original version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em> was ported to the PlayStation 3 as <em>Tales of Graces f</em>. The expansion not only featured an additional story about half as long as the main plotline, but it also provided interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">Mysterious Waif</a>. In addition to that, there was many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a> that was fixed in the port, including one that would otherwise make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">replaying it</a> next to impossible. It was this version that was ultimately ported to the West as a PS3 exclusive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence">Tales of Innocence</a></em> was remade for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita">Play Station Vita</a> as <em>Tales of Innocence R</em>. Changes include a new battle system, a new system for learning abilities, touchscreen support, updated graphics, a new opening song, more anime cutscenes, and two new party members that are integrated into the storyline. Neither version has been released in Western countries, in contrast to how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts">Tales of Hearts</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemadeForTheExport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemadeForTheExport">Remade for the Export</a> as <em>Tales of Hearts R</em>.

Barring lower graphical fidelity and visuals, this version made many significant improvements over the PC original. The controls were revised for the controller and introduced a new tutorial that thoroughly explained the mechanics of the game. The port also tweaked the game's difficulty curve of the prologue mission, meaning that players would no longer have to worry about being stuck as a result of attacks being interrupted mid-swing by an enemy hitting Geralt from the side. As if that wasn't enough, people who purchased the port received a game guide, a world map, concept art, interviews, a soundtrack, four hours of additional gameplay, <em>and</em> a code to redeem a separate PC copy from GOG.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> saw an upgraded re-release in 2012, for the PC, Mac, and iPhone platforms, under the title of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. This version featured several bug fixes, new characters/quests/items, the contents from the Tales of the Sword Coast included, addition of character sets from Baldur's Gate 2 and a graphical makeover to support current-generation resolutions. Unfortunately, it also introduces some minor bugs, and there's still no news of an announced Android version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em> was ported to iOS and Android with an interface designed to take advantage of the touch screen: Instead of using an on-screen D-pad to navigate through menus, you just touch your choice like you would a native iOS or Android app. Also, Square Enix fixed a number of bugs. Sadly, multiplayer was cut, although there is always hope it will be added in an update.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuramasaTheDemonBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuramasaTheDemonBlade">Muramasa Rebirth</a></em> for the PlayStation Vita takes the original Wii title and gives it updated visuals, an improved localization courtesy of Aksys Games (the same folks that brought you the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> series), and customizable controls (including an independent Jump button).
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable</a></em> was ported to PC and Mac as <em>Fable: The Lost Chapters</em> with remappable controls, smoother frame-rate, video settings that help the game look gorgeous, a mouse-driven interface that makes the game's menus more intuitive, and a wealth of new content added into the game (more quests, new equipment, more enemies, new regions, etc.).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestBriansJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestBriansJourney">Quest: Brian's Journey</a></em>, the GBC version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quest64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quest64">Quest 64</a></em>, ended up being a much better version of the game. The two versions were essentially the same, but with two glaring differences: <em>Brian's Journey</em> had fully complete areas and cutscenes beyond the opening/ending! It's quite an improvement from 64, since the basic story of the game is actually explained and areas aren't as empty-looking.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KisekiSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KisekiSeries">Kiseki Series</a></em>: Any PC port done by the localization team <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSeedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSeedGames">X Seed Games</a></em> is guaranteed to be better than its original release.

While the original games were released on Japanese home computers to begin with, this was done circa 2004 to 2007 on software that was already outdated by the time <em>FC</em> came out. While the programming team faced a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>, it was holy worth the results. The game uses HD assets from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> version, includes battle lines from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PSP</a> port, restores censored content in <em>The Third</em> from the aforementioned port, has an expanded and recompiled lighting engine with upgraded draw distance and shadows, offers wide screen support, a completely customizable remapping launcher, patched in several minor improvements to the translations, and runs easily on even the weakest modern laptops at 60FPS and 1080P.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The port was enhanced by Peter Durante of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> fame who fixed their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">infamously broken ports</a>, and he brings his A-game here. The sheer amount of improvements are covered in <a class="urllink" href="http://xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/163180020530/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-pc">three<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/163454030210/loh-trails-of-cold-steel-pc-guest-blog-2-from">blog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/163720373505/loh-trails-of-cold-steel-pc-guest-blog-3-from">entries<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but to summarize: The graphical engine was redone from the ground up to include full screen support, an unbroken 60FPS with 30 and unlimited options, revamped menus that now include unmodified HD character art, shadow effects that now render on every background object that can be adjusted, a much, much larger draw distance with better lighting, resolution settings up to 4K, ultra wide screen support that can handle theoretically any monitor known to man, customizable key rebinding, three custom shortcuts, decompressed the textures from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita">Play Station Vita</a> original, and perhaps most impressively, a turbo feature that speeds up the game's animations by four times their speed without effecting music, sound effects, button prompts, or voice acting. And on that note, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSeedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSeedGames">X Seed Games</a></em> included 5000 new lines of dialogue for the main character where he'd previously gone unvoiced, and brought back cast members to rerecord parts of the script. As if all of that wasn't enough, there was even some more stuff that was fixed in patches after the game was released, including almost all instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Spell My Name with an "S"</a> errors seen in signs throughout the game, such as the infamous "Train Militaly Police" and "jelato" instead of "gelato."
</li></ul></li><li> The Nintendo Switch porting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a></em> has a small, but still interesting difference compared to the other console releases: while the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game have only the English audio track on disc and requires an internet connection for foreign languages, the Switch version haves all the audio tracks on the cartridge.
</li><li> Almost any remake of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> game is considered much better than the original game. Usually thanks to polished gameplay, better graphics, excellent translation work, and often a large amount of additional content.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> received a Game Boy Color port that, in spite of the hardware being just slightly more powerful than the NES, plays almost exactly like the stellar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">and Japan-exclusive</a>) Super Famicom port, including a remake of the opening animation, animated enemy sprites, and the Pachisi minigame.
</li><li> The Switch version of <em>Dragon Quest XI</em> lives up to its moniker of being the Definitive Edition; while the graphics are only slightly downgraded compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> original, it adds new story scenes to flesh it out even more, the choice between English and Japanese voice tracks, as well as both the midi and orchestral soundtracks, and even includes the (otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japan-only</a>) 3DS version's 16-bit mode.

<ul><li> The Sega Saturn port has been hailed as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort">arcade-accurate</a>, allowing the selection of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MahouDaisakusen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MahouDaisakusen">Mahou Daisakusen</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter">guest characters</a> without a code, allowing resetting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">rank</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">simply by opening the options menu instead of resetting the game</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56w0m');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note56w0m" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56w0m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The rank at the start of the game slightly increases with consecutive plays, and in the arcade version, the only way to lower it is to let the game run the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode">Attract Mode</a> or reset the game</span>, a unique control scheme for experimenting with autofire rates, and last but not least, a choice between the original game soundtrack or an arranged soundtrack. Basically, if you can't get your hands on the PCB, this is the next best option, and some would argue that it's an even better one.
</li><li> The <em>Battle Garegga Rev.2016</em> port for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is even better, having been developed by M2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mushihimesama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mushihimesama">Mushihime-sama</a> Futari</em> and the <em>3D Classics</em> series fame. It has most of the Saturn has, along with many ways to tweak the game experience such gadgets for displaying important real-time data, as a Super Easy mode, a custom mode that lets you change individual elements of the game (such as disabling the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicDifficulty">Dynamic Difficulty</a> system), an arrange mode, and <em>four</em> soundtrack options (arcade original, Saturn arrange, arcade remastered, and 2016 arrange).
</li></ul></li><li> The Steam version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatHazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeatHazard">Beat Hazard</a> Ultra</em> features a real-time news system through RSS and social feed through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> (optional), and access to internet radio. The Shadow Operations Unit DLC also adds extra ships and the ability to create your own. The retail PC version of the original game by THQ plays much like original Xbox Live Indie Games version but with the addition of extra songs and the unlockable Suicidal difficulty.
</li><li> The home ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfShikigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfShikigami">Castle of Shikigami</a> III</em> gained new features such the option to using an arranged version of <em>Castle of Shikigami II</em>'s soundtrack, the ability to use TATE (vertical) mode, a re-balanced Director's Cut mode, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> mode, and a Dramatic Change mode wherein one player play use a team of two characters and swap them on the fly during gameplay. The Wii and Xbox 360 versions also have a Gallery with a slew of unlockable artwork, an unlockable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest">Juke Box</a> feature, and an Extra Options feature where various game settings can be changed outside of the normal gameplay; the latter also has online leaderboards.
</li><li> The NES port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Toki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Toki">Toki</a></em> used smaller sprites and much more of the screen was visible at a time. This greatly reduced the number of cheap deaths in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DesertStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DesertStrike">Soviet Strike</a></em> is practically the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> game that turned out better on the Sega Saturn than the PlayStation. Framerate is roughly the same, but the Saturn version has more detailed textures and even boasts a few new wingtip weapons. It also controls very well with the Mission Stick. The only downside is that the Saturn version cut some of the non-plot critical video clips.
</li><li> The Amiga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DesertStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DesertStrike">Desert Strike</a></em> was obviously a labour of love for the porting team. The sounds were redone, which included adding radio chatter in the title sequence, and a pleasant female voice notifying the player during missions of important information. A good deal of the graphics was redone, and it added a good deal of background flavour, such as wrecked vehicles strewn on roadsides and oases in the desert. Probably the most fondly remembered change was that the pitiful and cartoony explosions of the original were changed to mushroom clouds accompanied by a mighty sound and the entire screen flashing white for a split-second.
</li><li> The PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ESCHATOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ESCHATOS">ESCHATOS</a></em> gives the game higher resolution visuals than the Xbox 360 version, with many extra visual options available from the start instead of unlocking them through gameplay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a></em>:
<ul><li> Those who have played both the original arcade version of <em>III</em> and its SNES port typically regard the latter to be superior, save for the much greater slowdown, and a much more forgiving challenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a> II</em> on the PC Engine is a very fine and accurate port of the original, to the point where it uses Red Book audio for the soundtrack, <em>and</em> it adds a new stage. Considering that arcade-to-console ports around its time often had to compromise elements from the arcade version to fit within system limitations, this is saying something.
</li><li> The Famicom port of <em>Gradius II</em> goes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a> route, featuring unique stage layouts and environments, vertically-scrollable stages (an impressive technical feat given that the NES's and Famicom's hardware are natively only designed to scroll horizontally or vertically but not both at once), up to four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Options</a> available on-screen at once (<em>Gradius</em> and the non-Japanese release of <em>Life Force</em>/<em>Salamander</em> on the same platform only allows two Options at once, and the Japanese version of the latter allows three) with a rotating-Option powerup available once all four Options are active, and original music tracks not found in the original arcade version. Unfortunately, this requires the aid of an expansion chip that can't be used with the NES due to relocating two of the necessary pins, so it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japan-only</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Xbox 360 port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ketsui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ketsui">Ketsui</a></em> fixes some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game Breaking Bugs</a> present in the original, such as the music playing at half speed in Stage 5 and the screen momentarily freezing right before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">DOOM</a>.
<ul><li> After the port of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleGaregga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleGaregga">Battle Garegga</a>, M2 has done it again with <em>Ketsui Deathtiny</em>, which is not only practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort">arcade-perfect</a>, but also adds in a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Super Easy</a>" mode, an exclusive arrange mode in "Deathtiny", arcade challenges to practice in specific areas of stages, the 2007 IKD arrange previously only available for one day in a 2007 Cave festival, and a custom mode to mix and match these modes along with <em>four</em> soundtrack options (The Original arcade version, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Basiscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Basiscape">Basiscape</a> arrange made for the Xbox 360 port, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Virt">Virt</a> arrange made for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi">DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu Black Label</a>'s Ketsui <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangeMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangeMode">Arrange Mode</a>, and a completely new arrange by Daisuke Matsumoto).

</li><li> The Xbox 360 ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mushihimesama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mushihimesama">Mushihime-sama</a> Futari</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Espgaluda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Espgaluda">Espgaluda</a> II</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathSmiles">Death Smiles</a></em> all have "Xbox 360" modes with much higher-resolution sprites. They also come packed with "Black Label" versions (except in the case of <em>Futari</em>; you have to pay an extra $15 for it), a blessing in the case of <em>Futari</em> and <em>DeathSmiles</em> considering that their respective Black Label arcade releases had very limited print runs.
<ul><li> <em>DeathSmiles</em>'s 360 mode, which in other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CAVE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CAVE">CAVE</a> ports is typically just an HD version of the game it's a port of, allows the player to select Level 1 on every stage (instead of locking it out after a few stages), allows selection of Casper and Rosa without having to enter a code, and rebalances the characters&#151;Windia in particular has been upgraded from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Tier-Induced Scrappy</a> to a play-worthy character.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantSilvergun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RadiantSilvergun">Radiant Silvergun</a></em> was originally on arcades and was ported to the Sega Saturn with an extra Saturn mode that adds anime cutscenes to flesh out the engrossing plot, more boss battles and hidden dogs, and the ability to save your weapon power for subsequent playthroughs. It also has an unlockable Options+ feature that allowed you to change the ship or game speed, and show the hitboxes during gameplay. The Xbox 360 port later gave the game optional higher resolution visuals with bloom and HDR lighting, leaderboards, shareable replays on Xbox Live, and for those with at least one Achievement from <em>Ikaruga</em>, the ability to play the game with its spiritual successor's chaining mechanics. The anime cutscenes were also remastered, but unfortunately the Xbox 360 version runs in a 16:9 aspect-ratio yet pillar-boxed in 4:3 and it does not crop the screen to the latter for those with non-widescreen displays, and the Story Mode no longer allows continues from losing lives unlike the Sega Saturn version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Raiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Raiden">Raiden</a></em> <em>III</em> and <em>Raiden IV: Overkill</em> for the PC comes with bonus content and unlockable incentives to keep replaying the games after beating them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaySeries">RAY Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>RayForce</em> (<em>Galactic Attack</em> in North America or <em>Layer Section</em> in Japan) on Sega Saturn not only retains the visuals of the arcade release, it also took advantage of the CD-ROM's storage space to produce new renditions of the arcade version's memorable soundtrack with instruments and greatly improved upon the overall quality of the game's soundtrack. It also features the ability to rotate the game screen vertically for those that had the ability to rotate their displays, allowing the game to be played in the vertically-oriented aspect-ratio like in the arcade version.
</li><li> <em>RayStorm</em> and <em>RayCrisis</em> on PC runs on higher resolution than the arcade version with more audible sound effects than the PlayStation version. Although the PC ports of these games were made for Windows 95/98, they run quite well on modern operating systems and those with higher-end systems (unless you're on Windows 8 or 8.1 which runs poorly due to poor support for older DirectX games) have the benefit of almost non-existent loading times. The downside of these ports however that <em>RayStorm</em> requires the disc to run it and lacks the optional TANZ remixed soundtracks for Extra Mode due to being a port of the arcade version instead of the PlayStation version, while <em>RayCrisis</em>' PC port is based on the PlayStation version, which lacks the co-op multiplayer the original arcade version had.
</li><li> This series received mobile ports on iOS, Android, and Amazon devices, which presents these games in higher resolutions, features an optional remixed track for their first stage (the Amazon versions also have one for their second stages as well), and touch controls that work beautifully for these games, but they have also been updated to support traditional bluetooth-supported controllers for those that prefer standard controls. This was also the first time that RayCrisis got a home port based off its arcade version, which has co-op multiplayer and seemless transitions between stages. However, due to being based of their arcade counterparts, these versions also lack the unlockables their console ports had, <em>RayStorm</em> does not have individual difficulty sliders for each level, and in the case of the Amazon versions, are lacking online leaderboards and achievements while <em>RayCrisis</em> has yet to see a release on Amazon devices.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SmashTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SmashTV">Smash TV</a></em> was an arcade game that was notorious for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>. The home version wasn't exactly easier, but with unlimited continues meaning you could play it without spending a fortune in quarters, it was certainly more <em>enjoyable</em>. One feature it has over the arcade original is an actual soundtrack; in a developer interview, the sound engineer for the arcade game was instructed not to put too much effort into the music since the game's constant gunfire and explosions would drown it out anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwinkleStarSprites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwinkleStarSprites">Twinkle Star Sprites</a></em> got a Sega Saturn port that included both the original arcade version in "Arcade Mode" and an updated "Segasaturn Mode" that features fully voiced dialogue, the option to turn off the slowdown, made every character playable in Character Mode without inputting a special code for the hidden ones, and added a new character to the roster, but the in-game dialogue suffers from weaker audio quality and the game loads often. The Saturn version also included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">a bonus disc</a> bundled with artwork (both official and fan-submitted), a karaoke, and special messages from the characters. It later got a Dreamcast port which lacks the additions and bonuses the Saturn version have but has higher quality audio, non-existent loading times, better frame-rate, and is playable in English. Unfortunately, both console versions were never released outside of Japan.
</li><li> Of the four ways to play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius">Dariusburst</a> Another Chronicle</em> on a consumer platform (PC, PS4, Vita, PSTV), the PC version is perhaps the best one, being the only one with dual-monitor support. (It helps that the arcade version uses PC-based architecture to begin with.) Later updates added the option to quickly restart from the beginning of the chosen root stage in Original or EX mode or the beginning of the mission in Chronicle Mode, so you don't have to go back to the title screen and navigate the menus all over again.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Apple Macintosh</a> port of the game got a remixed Red Book soundtrack instead.
<ul><li> Not only that, the Mac's higher resolution screen, superior color palette, and generally greater power meant that the game ran at a higher resolution and had much of its interface graphics redrawn to match.

It retains a surprising number of functions in spite of a default control setup that lacked dual analog sticks and supported analog controllers for both systems<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6l9vs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6l9vs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6l9vs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though due to its date of release, the Playstation version only support the little-known analog joystick and dual analog controllers, and not the much more common Dualshock</span>, was generally prettier and higher-resolution than the original release of <em>Mechwarrior 2</em> for PC, and still managed to run smoothly without lag hiccups while reading the disc, as sometimes happened to the PC version. It even managed to keep the music of the original. It would be another year before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> known as the Titanium Trilogy for PC would come by to make things look prettier than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version, but that came with a few of its own problems.

<ul><li> The PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> had beautifully upgraded graphics, smoothed textures, the option to pause and save rather than having to call Mei Ling for it, and quite a few other improvements. It unfortunately had compatibility issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">later Windows operating systems and newer hardware</a>, however, the 2020 GOG.com re-release has remedied virtually all of them and added some extra graphical settings that can improve the visuals even further. Too bad the same justice wasn't done for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">MGS2</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">PC port</a>.

They fixed issues with vertical sync during cutscenes that were in the original version due the PlayStation 2's hardware limitations, the touch screen was used for handling items and weapons which made it less akward and much more convenient then the original controls, and the visuals were given a nice upgrade.
</li><li> The port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> has been met with positive reception. Though it still has some issues (including a now-fixed bug that would close the game when there was no Internet connection), it is a rather solid port, and people from Platinum and Konami are getting active feedback from PC players, as well. It also includes a "ZANGEKI" option that lets you adjust the amount of cuts you can perform, and you can jump straight into boss battles of previously cleared chapters instead of playing them through to get the boss. It's very well optimized, and the system requirements are quite overblown. On top of that, the port is bundled with <em>all</em> of the game's DLC, and it can be unlocked from the get-go with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">Konami Code</a>. Despite all of this, the port still only costs half of what the console versions do.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> update, subtitled <em>Inferno</em>, fixed glitches from the other releases and even adds a few extra scenes. While not without its flaws, <em>Inferno</em> was vastly improved and closer to what the developers envisioned.
</li><li> The PC version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">Alan Wake</a></em> is considered by many critics to be better than the original Xbox 360 release.

The PlayStation version also supported its own mouse peripheral.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> port of the first game wasn't exactly more <em>polished</em>, per se. Its graphical quality takes a slight dip compared to the PSX original, but it does include new costumes, a few new enemy reskins, and the first-ever Battle Mode minigame in the series (one of those new enemies, by the way, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a zombie version of Wesker</span>). There was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> port which added some new puzzle elements, map and status display on the 2nd screen, allowed players to skip the door loading screens, and added some first person combat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> was given a remake on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube">GameCube</a>, which gave it a lot of visual improvements amongst other things. The remastered version for Steam, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation4">Playstation 4</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> brings up the visuals to HD quality, touched up some of the facial animations of the characters, added new costumes, gave an option to play with classic tank controls or modern controls, added widescreen support, included leaderboards, and added achievements. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0">Resident Evil 0</a></em> was also given a similar remaster on the same platforms.

This version, unfortunately, never was released outside of Japan, and SourceNext handled <em>Resident Evil 4</em>'s PC port <em>very</em> poorly.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Wii edition</a></em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> is what the original PC port should have been. It has the superior visuals of the GameCube version (as well as true widescreen support) with all of the PlayStation 2 version's extra content. It also gives players the option to use the Wii remote to aim at and shoot enemies. The HD Edition on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 presents the game in a higher native resolution, added shadows and colored lighting in many locations. The Ultimate HD Edition of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> rectifies the many problems SourceNext's port of the game had. It gives players the option of using smoother frame-rate, higher resolutions, HD textures, mouse and keyboard support, and better controller support.

Flick-targeting, one of the things that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">many people hated about the original version</a>, is much easier to deal with due to the keyboard and mouse control scheme, so you're no longer forced to use it when you don't want to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BulletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BulletWitch">Bullet Witch</a></em> was ported to PC in 2018, which not only presented the game in higher native resolutions and frame-rate over the original Xbox 360 release, it also supports mouse and keyboard controls, rebalances the gameplay around the original Japanese version's difficulty, and includes all of the game's DLCs, even the bonus missions that were locked away as separate purchases in the international versions. The PC version also features a dashing ability (originally meant for debugging purposes) that Alicia can use, which can help make playing through the game's large and expansive levels less of a slog to trudge through.
</li><li> The PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> went off without a hitch with some additional graphical options. And not only that, the developers added extra content in the last chapter before the train station, detailing the accounts of Delta Squad escaping the Brumak that tried to cut them off when escaping the Fenix manor. Though unfortunately there were some issues when Microsoft forgot to renew the license for the game, resulting in people being unable to register the product or play it in a certain time frame, also some people reported having issues with installing the game and certain graphics cards being incompatible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FurFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FurFighters">Fur Fighters</a></em> was originally a Dreamcast-exclusive but was ported over to the PlayStation 2 a year after its release. The graphics got a Cel-Shaded makeover, all the character were fully voiced and the boxart was made to look more "mature".

Later versions for graphically less-powerful systems had more mini-games and strategy after the Amiga buyers complained (looks great, get to do nothing).
</li><li> The GCN version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gladius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gladius">Gladius</a></em> is significantly better with the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">main issue</a>, primary due to the Nintendo Optical Disc being optimized for fast load times.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a>: We Meet Again</em> for the Wii is fundamentally the same game as the PlayStation 2 original, but NIS took the time to remaster every single level and background to take advantage of the Wii's higher graphical capabilities (as well as add another story with some new stuff to collect, but that's par for the course for the company). The result is a much crisper look on the same great game. This version was then re-ported to the PSP as <em>Phantom Brave: Heros of the Hermuda Triangle</em>, which adds Hero Prinny, The Unlosing Ranger, and Asagi to the cast of playable phantoms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">Disgaea: Hour of Darkness</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories</a></em> both got rereleases on the PSP adding some extra items and cameos, correcting a few bugs, and each add a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherSideAnotherStory">second mode with an alternate protagonist</a>, more bonus bosses, more playable characters, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Dark Hero Days</a> added DLC and Disgaea 3's Magichanges and passing system. The DS port of the first game added all this plus Prinny Commentary and more hidden characters, but has inferior music and lacks much of the voice acting. Both ports of the first game also replaced Etna's and Thursday's/Vulcanus' voice actors with their new ones. All this is to provide better links to later games in the series and other Nippon Ichi titles.
</li><li> Nippon Ichi is at it again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice">Disgaea 3</a>: Absence of Detention</em> for the PlayStation Vita. Animated talking sprites, all the DLC already included (Including Beryl mode), two new charcters, more alternate scenarios with different leads, new spells and class specific attacks for the generic humanoids.
</li><li> Disgaea 4's Vita port loses the option to use the Low-Def sprites (other than Asagi), but gains a new story featuring human Atina and Tyrant Valzy, along with new charcter Nagi Clockwork and a Time Traveling Fuka and Desco. Having data for Disgaea 3 on the memory card allows the return of Stella and Rutile from the Vita port of that game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a> CD</em> for the Sega CD, which took the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> Shining Force games and improved the graphics, added CD-quality music, voice-overs, and extra quests.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series started off on the Game Boy Advance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">in Japan only</a> until Capcom decided to bring the series overseas on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>. Sprites were scaled up to accommodate the bigger screen size on the DS without any loss in quality and the sound was significantly improved. The first Ace Attorney game also gained an extra case for players to tackle and it would be referenced in the <em>Apollo Justice</em> chapter of the series years later. And then there are the iOS ports. iOS devices tend to have way higher resolution (current iPads sport 2K<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7dfn6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7dfn6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7dfn6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">2048x1536</span> displays), better quality sound (especially with headphones), more memory, and more processing power than the original consoles the games were for, something Capcom is clearly aware of (although their initial attempt to port to iOS ended in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a>, their subsequent attempts to improve the port by means of updates fixed various bugs and even added new features until it fitted this trope). The interface is also tweaked to work with a single touchscreen that is also the primary display really well. Lastly, this is often used to fix bugs as well.

The first game's rerelease was brought over to the West in this form.
</li><li> The PS3 port of Sonicomi was fully voiced (in contrast with the PC original, where only the main girl's dialogue was voiced), underwent a massive graphical upgrade, and added more content. When the game was localized into English, the new release was based on this version despite coming out for PC, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus">porting nearly all of the PS3 enhancements over</a>.

<ul><li> For a good while, the PC ports of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series (the very first game through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>) were considered to be better than the originals, thanks to higher-resolution visuals, faster loading times, more accurate mouse-and-keyboard controls, and modding potential with swappable player character skins, in-game MP3 players, and a plethora of user-created vehicles and mods (including the legendary <em>Multi Theft Auto</em> mod, adding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a> multiplayer mode to GTA years before GTA IV did the same and reintroducing a feature <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto2">Grand Theft Auto 2</a></em> had on the PC to begin with). Unfortunately, the PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> failed to uphold the same reputation and was widely regarded as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> instead, though patches have since remedied this. Luckily, the PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> was a major improvement, even compared to the PS4/Xbone versions. Better graphics, a Video Editor, 60 FPS, faster loading times, and runs much better than <em>IV</em>.
<ul><li> The Xbox versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Vice City</a></em> (both released in 2004 as the <em>Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack</em>) were also praised for their number of significant graphical improvements (more so than the PC ports), such as improved character models, textures and lighting, as well as the ability to play custom music from the console's hard drive, which the PlayStation 2 version couldn't do. These visual enhancements were less apparent on the Xbox port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>, looking identical to the PC port, but the custom soundtrack feature was still intact.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause</a> 2</em> is the best-optimized multiplatform sandbox game released on the PC in its generation by far, running more smoothly while having even larger environments than most games in the genre. On a Q6600/8800 GT system, it can easily maintain 60 FPS while other ports average closer to 30 FPS. Keyboard-and-mouse controls are also very tight and customizable, while Xbox 360 gamepad support is retained. There's even a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modding community</a> adding features like a full-fledged <em>multiplayer mode</em>, much like what happened to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> above.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> game, originally for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, was ported for Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. There are different numbers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Execution</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPotential">Styles</a>, an amount of new content and the latter two make some use of motion-based controls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs">Sleeping Dogs</a></em>: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/08/22/square-enix-sleeping-dogs-pc-port/">Square Enix pushed for a well-optimized and improved PC version.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a> Guerrilla</em> Steam Version: while the retail release back when it was new suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a>, the re-release by Nordic Games did away with all of its problems, first by removal of the defunct Games for Windows Live and changing of server management to Steamworks, engine-level modification that adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DirectX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DirectX">Direct X</a> 11 features to a 2009 game, and overall massive optimization to make the game play as intended.
</li><li> While the console and mobile ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> suffer from unavoidable hard limits on world size due to the finite storage available, and have long been out of step with the PC version(s) due to being worked on by a different studio&mdash;lagging way behind some new features, forging ahead with new features of their own, and just implementing some things differently for no apparent reason&mdash;they've always been competent ports considering the limitations they had to work around, and have even inspired the main dev team to incorporate some of their changes back into the Java Edition (the reworked boat behavior, for example, and the built-in book of crafting recipes). And the quality of its optimization became clearer once it was ported to Windows 10, allowing direct performance comparison with the Java-based classic version. But perhaps most notable of all is that the unified, revamped, and rechristened "Bedrock" version features cross-play between every single platform it's available on: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>, iOS, Android, and Windows 10. The PS4 was the sole holdout for about a year before public pressure forced Sony's hand. The idea of cross-platform play between <em>any</em> two competing consoles was unthinkable before this; now it has a decent chance of becoming an industry norm, and you'll have <em>Minecraft</em> to thank for it. On a related note, the aforementioned Java Edition is <em>the</em> killer app for desktop Linux, and has been available for it since the beginning. Many users report that it runs more smoothly on Linux than on Windows, simply due to how well Java (or OpenJDK) and OpenGL perform&mdash;and of course it's fully cross-compatible with the Windows and MacOS versions.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowgate">Shadowgate</a></em> was polished in its port from the home computer to the NES. The NES has better dialogue, better graphics, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">haunting soundtrack</a>. Years later, the GBC port <em>Shadowgate Classic</em> (which, itself, was based off of the NES version) polished things even further by including even better graphics, and fixing a couple of annoying glitches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DejaVu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DejaVu">D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu</a></em> got this treatment in <em>Deja Vu I and II</em> for the NES, with improved graphics based on the Windows version of the game and, as the name would imply, incorporating the game's sequel into the same cartridge (an NES port was announced earlier but eventually became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWare">Vapor Ware</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Action52">Action 52</a></em> on the Sega Genesis by Far-Sight Studios was still rubbish, but it was indeed superior to the original NES version. Among other things, it is far more stable than its NES counterpart, which is notorious for consisting of more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game Breaking Bugs</a> than there are games. They even got at least one big name to work on the port: the music was programmed by Mark Miller, who also did sound work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToeJamAndEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToeJamAndEarl">Toe Jam And Earl</a></em> and ported many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommyTallarico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommyTallarico">Tommy Tallarico</a>'s soundtracks to the Genesis. Yet oddly enough, there isn't anything as catchy in the Genesis version as the NES Cheetahmen theme. Just as strangely, most of the games were completely different.
</li><li> The PlayStation port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Superman64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Superman64">Superman 64</a></em> was never released, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">had it been available</a>, it would have fixed several of the game's notorious problems.
</li><li> The DS version of Tony Hawk's Proving Ground was almost unanimously considered by reviewers as superior to the original console versions for sticking to classic gameplay mechanics and having a wide array of online multiplayer features.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilipsCDi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PhilipsCDi">Philips CD-i</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDOInteractiveMultiplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDOInteractiveMultiplayer">3DO</a> and PlayStation ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrainDead13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrainDead13">Brain Dead 13</a></em> have higher video qualities than the MS-DOS, Windows, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar">Atari Jaguar</a>, and Sega Saturn ports, though the former first three each have two CDs instead of one; but only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IOSGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IOSGames">iOS</a> port, which does not require any CDs, has a higher video resolution that surpasses all of the earlier versions. Also, the 3DO port has two versions of Disc 1: the original one, and "Version 1.1", which fixes a bug that would sometimes cause a crash in Vivi's Salon in the original release. The iOS port did the same in December 2010 by upgrading its version from 1.0 to 1.1, which added support for iOS 3.0 and 4.2 and fixed various bugs.
</li><li> The SNES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedWatersNewHorizons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedWatersNewHorizons">Uncharted Waters: New Horizons</a></em> takes full advantage of the SNES' SPC700 chipset and uses high quality samples to produce superior music, and combined with the fancy raster effects that is unique to the SNES version due to its advanced graphical capabilities, is widely hailed as the superior port. The other ports of the game were optimized for comparatively inferior OPL2 MIDI chip (although the Sega Genesis version managed to sound slightly better by supplementing the OPL2 MIDI music with PSG-based percussions) and has slightly less sophisticated graphical effects. The PC version technically got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">shortest stick</a>, with a crippled MIDI track that's only optimized for the AdLib music card, inability to support Sound Font enabled cards like the Gravis Ultrasound or SoundBlaster AWE32 for instrument samples even though both cards were already released when the game came out, and not only had the least amount of graphical effects of all the ports, it even failed at simple graphical effects like smooth screen scrolling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams">NiGHTS into Dreams...</a></em> was re-released for the PlayStation 2 featuring a "Brand New Dreams" mode with a graphical overhaul (higher quality models, higher resolution textures, all sprite-based assets are rendered in polygons, etc.), widescreen support, the original Saturn version in the form of a "Sega Saturn Dreams" mode, and the very rare <em>Christmas NiGHTS</em> expansion as an unlockable bonus. However, the controls were not as smooth and the audio not as pristine as the Sega Saturn version, and a few features such as multiplayer mode, Sonic into Dreams or Link Attack were left out. This version was never released outside of Japan unfortunately, however, the PlayStation 2 version served as the basis for the HD remastered version released worldwide for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>, presenting the game in a higher native resolution and later fixed the control issues with patch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicDash">Sonic Dash</a></em>. The Windows 8.1 port is much more polished than ports of other mobile games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FruitNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FruitNinja">Fruit Ninja</a></em>, which became a huge microtransaction mess. Sonic Dash on Windows 8.1, in particular, can be played on landscape mode, while on, say, an Android phone, the game is played in portrait mode. The game also automatically gives you mouse and keyboard controls if you are not playing the game on a tablet, unlike ports of other mobile games which assume that you are always playing on a tablet.
</li><li> The Windows 8 port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetpackJoyride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetpackJoyride">Jetpack Joyride</a></em> plays exactly like early versions of its mobile counterpart. A few things from it are missing in this port, but a few things that were removed from the mobile version are still present in this port.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gameloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Gameloft">Gameloft</a>'s games on the Windows Store are considered excellent ports of their mobile counterparts (and Microsoft is well aware of this, as there is a whole collection on the Windows Store with Gameloft games). The only exception to this is the Windows 8.1 port of their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> game: while not a bad port, it is just outdated. Certain areas, such as Sweet Apple Acres and the Everfree Forest are completely missing (and Sweet Apple Acres was already added to the game when this port came out), and accessing the minecart game is made significantly harder in this version: while in the other versions you just need one wheel to access the game, and you can keep going as long as you have wheels, in this port, you need four wheels and can only play once.
</li><li> The Windows 95 port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a></em>. The graphics have been beautifully redrawn, features the higher quality soundtrack from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> version, new sound effects, more levels, the FMV sequences from <em>Tides of Time</em>, a new difficulty system, tightens up the controls, and includes a save feature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter">Trauma Center: Second Opinion</a></em> for the Nintendo Wii was more of remake of <em>Under the Knife</em> for the Nintendo DS, but it introduced a new control scheme that solved the issue of switching tools quickly. The art was redone for both gameplay and characters. While the last chapter of the story was reduced to a cutscene, another chapter was added at the end as well as a parallel running chapter with unique gimmicks, such as taking advantage of the motion controls the Wii Remote offers.
</li><li> The IOS port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingOfDragonPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingOfDragonPass">King of Dragon Pass</a></em> fixed outstanding bugs and streamlined some of the more finicky areas of the game. This version also adds a number of new scenes including a recurring character and potential ring member, Theya the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">Seer</a>. Notably, this version was also ported <em>back</em> to PC and Mac; the version for sale on Steam is a re-port of the IOS game, rather than the original.
