</p><p>To provide a concrete example, let's say you're changing channels and come upon a show involving two men sitting at a bar in some tropical country. One in a military-looking uniform with a hammer-and-sickle badge on the side is whispering in heavily accented English about his worries that the Berlin Wall may not last. The other man, sporting a glorious mullet, clips his absolutely gigantic cell phone to his belt before putting his hand on the other man's shoulder reassuringly.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>When viewed by someone with even a shaky grasp of history, the historical period is blindingly obvious. Such a scene would have been made at the time with the focus entirely on Cold War politics, but the first thing the modern audience notices are the clunky cell phone and the mullet.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrowParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrowParody">Narrow Parody</a> is a subset of this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a> is when a work's depiction of the <em>future</em> becomes dated, so all works with a far-future setting belong there, not here.
</p><p>While just about every work becomes somewhat of a period piece after it becomes more than a decade old due to the characters referencing old trends, wearing out-of-style fashions and using out-of-date technology, this trope only really applies to works that wear their dates so blatantly that a viewer can identify the era or even year it was made in as soon as they begin to watch it. For example, while the 1990s sitcoms <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> show their age in many respects, they don't wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> so blatantly as to have this trope apply to them. On the flip side, a work based heavily around popular music &mdash; such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastDragon">The Last Dragon</a></em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Dazzler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Dazzler">Dazzler</a>'s solo comic as a superpowered disco diva &mdash; can become <em>painfully</em> dated due to the rapidly changing nature of what's considered "hip".
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Some jokes fall victim to this when a history lesson is essentially required to explain the joke to folks who weren't around at the time the joke was funny. While a joke about a president who is long remembered may have many years of life, a joke about a news story that isn't well-remembered 20 years later except by the people who were alive at the time or paying attention, or based on a then-popular but now long-gone ad campaign, wouldn't &mdash; inverting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Don't Explain the Joke</a> because the explanation is necessary. As the years pass, the number of people who get the joke or remember the reference shrinks until the joke becomes an artifact of the generation. Historians studying an era, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">read the joke and get a good laugh out of it still</a> and these jokes can liven up an otherwise dullish history lesson, or amuse a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">group of people knowledgeable of the era</a>, or catch your grandparent off guard: "I haven't heard that joke for years!" A "topical" work can fall victim to this if it has a premise that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a> &mdash; what was a major news story when the work was made can easily date it to its time period. A real life location <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage">may fall victim to a disaster that rapidly alters the landscape</a>. A good example of this is any film with shots of New York City before 9/11.

Look for examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marching On</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>, and scenes that would resemble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSandmanSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSandmanSequence">Mister Sandman Sequences</a> if they occurred in an <em>actual</em> period piece. Compare with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">Two Decades Behind</a>, which is when something inadvertently feels like a period piece despite having been made a good time after the period it seems to be based on, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">We're Still Relevant, Dammit!</a>, for when long-running series make blatant (and sometimes forced) references to modern culture in an attempt to seem up-to-date or to look more "hip", often resulting in one of these. Sometimes, especially when the viewer has spent too long on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThisVeryWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThisVeryWiki">This Very Wiki</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">the very tropes in use</a> may be recognisable of an era &mdash; such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">'90s Anti-Hero</a>.
</p><p>Note that a work being a product of its time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">doesn't necessarily mean it isn't relevant or entertaining to modern audiences</a>, even notwithstanding the kitsch or nostalgia factor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance">as many of the examples below will demonstrate</a>). If the work's severe datedness also makes it inaccessible to modern audiences, then you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. However, this trope can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> if an intellectual fashion was very short-lived. If a concept was new in its day but is now well-established and evolved beyond that, you're looking at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a>. If somehow the work manages to feel just as relevant today as it did then, if not more so, it's an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesResonance">Values Resonance</a>, not this trope. Obviously, films and TV shows that were done in black-and-white, or non-high definition, as well as video games, will automatically be dated for technical reasons, but if we listed them all we'd be here all day. So it would be best to judge them more by content and plot. If the material's universal but the outfits are dated to the minute, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionDissonance">Fashion Dissonance</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>, which is one possible way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subvert</a> this. Dismissing a work simply on the basis of its "datedness" would be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToNovelty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToNovelty">Appeal to Novelty</a>.
</p><p><strong>Important Sidenote</strong>: To avoid questionable examples, do not add a work less than 10 years old unless the situation is especially unusual. (Being completely overtaken by events by time of airing, and being called "instantly dated" by the press, have both qualified in the past.) For most works, it won't be particularly clear which ones really do bleed their production date out of every pore until roughly a decade has passed.
</p><p>However &mdash; also remember that while older references zing over the heads of younger consumers, newer references zing over the heads of older consumers, too. So references from modern times can <em>sometimes</em> be accurate, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ExamplesAreNotRecent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ExamplesAreNotRecent">TV Tropes does not know time</a>.

But beyond that, there's the central message of the film, best encapsulated in the line of dialogue "A good sock in the eye is something every woman needs at least once in her life." The movie suggests that women need to be kept in line with the occasional punch in the face. Blondell's character Vicki quite clearly <em>likes</em> getting punched in the face. At the end of the film, when her formerly wishy-washy husband finally hits her as he means it, her face lights up in joy. The final scene has Vicki on the couch, looking at her husband with bedroom eyes and saying "Tony &mdash; hit me again."
</li><li> It's technically a film from the '40s (1941), but Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo">Dumbo</a></em> has a very opaque '30s reference in its very first song, "Look Out for Mr. Stork." The singers casually mention "those quintuplets," which at the time would not have been necessary to explain because it is clearly a reference to the Dionne Quintuplets, five identical French-Canadian girls who became enormous celebrities during the Depression years simply by virtue of being quintuplets (and even that is dated, as quintuplets would hardly impress anyone today because <em>nonuplets</em> have since been born). The North American media obsessively covered the Dionne story for years (partly because it gave them an excuse to avoid any controversial economic or political topics that might have offended people in what was at the time a fairly heated social climate), with the result that the girls' entire childhood and adolescence became world news. You probably only remember the Dionne Quintuplets today if you're a Thirties buff, or a student of old newsreels, or maybe if you saw that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode that subtly parodied the phenomenon with a big fuss in the town over five identical Romanian girls. Also, during the song "When I See an Elephant Fly", one of the crows makes a reference to then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "fireside chats".

It depicts a President who fixes America by abolishing the Constitution, creating a private police force, ascending as an absolute dictator, and forcing other nations into submission through a superior military. And all of this is treated as <em>a good thing</em>. Such a President then was viewed as a willful, active leader compared to the incompetent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HerbertHoover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HerbertHoover">Herbert Hoover</a> (and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D.

But after seeing the damage wreaked by totalitarian dictators leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, today there's no way any such a President could be shown in film again without being depicted as a tyrant.

Kitty lives in an apartment building where men aren't even allowed to visit. Her co-workers yammer on about how all they want is a man.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnchorsAweigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnchorsAweigh">Anchors Aweigh</a></em> was released as a morale booster for the US Navy. While WWII was clearly coming to an end in Europe, it was still raging in the Pacific where the Navy was actively engaged against the Japanese. The opening sequence of the film is clearly designed to make the nation feel good about its naval forces.
</li><li> In some ways, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator">The Great Dictator</a></em> is actually quite ahead of its time in its satirical depiction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, since it openly mocked the Nazis when the United States was still neutral. In other ways, though, it's clearly an early-1940s film, and its depiction of Nazi Germany can seem rather jarring to modern audiences. For one thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> hadn't known the full scale of the Holocaust at the time the film was made (years later, he said if he had known, <em>he wouldn't have made the movie at all</em>), so he portrays the Nazis' domestic policies as <em>much</em> milder than they really were, i.e. the Nazi stand-ins are shown bullying and harassing the Jews, but nothing much worse than that. For another thing, he focuses much of the plot on the rivalry between Hitler and Mussolini (er...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">"Hynkel" and "Benzino"</a>) over the occupation of Austria, and portrays Mussolini as a seriously intimidating rival to Hitler; the dispute over the occupation of Austria was big news in 1940, but it's only remembered as a minor historical footnote today, and Fascist Italy is mostly remembered as an ally of Nazi Germany, and a pathethically ineffectual one.
</li><li> Likewise, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">Three Stooges</a></em> shorts <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouNaztySpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouNaztySpy">You Nazty Spy!</a></em> and <em>I'll Never Heil Again</em> were based on pre-war conceptions of the fascists as little more than thuggish buffoons; The Stooges (who were all Jewish) were devastated when they discovered the horrifying reality underlying all of the Nazis' pompous posturing.
</li><li> Even that era's more serious anti-Nazi films like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FritzLang">Fritz Lang</a>'s <em>Man Hunt</em> took the same line. In that film, Hitler's described as a "strutting little Caesar" whose greatest named atrocity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible">reintroducing the death penalty</a> to Germany, which must have seemed underwhelming to American audiences.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2o47j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2o47j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2o47j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was also untrue, as Germany already had the death penalty, though the Nazis expanded its use.</span>
</li><li> <em>Confessions of a Nazi Spy</em>, filmed in 1939 and released in 1940, portrayed the United States when it was feasible enough for even long-established German-Americans to be simultaneously loyal to both the United States and Germany that they could be seduced into spying on the former for the latter's benefit. Several of the spies in the film are members of the German-American Bund, an organization that was already under Congressional investigation by 1938 and was actually outlawed by 1942 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany.

Their blind optimism about the nobility of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> and advocacy for the US and USSR to remain steadfast allies stands in stark contrast to nearly every American film made during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, in which the Soviet Union was at worst a tyrannical empire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from Nazi Germany, or a lesser evil at best. Then there's all the millions of executions and war crimes committed by Stalin that have been uncovered over the years. Needless to say, all of the films were products of the Hollywood war effort.
</li><li> Pretty much any World War II film made while the war was still going on suffers from a lack of reference to the Holocaust, which was only discovered <em>after</em> Germany surrendered at the twilight of the conflict. Thus, while the Germans are still portrayed as the bad guys, it's not on much of a moral level beyond any other war movie enemy.

History-savvy viewers will spot pictures of Franklin D. Roosevelt on display &mdash; who died in April 1945, being replaced by Harry S. Truman. Dead bodies are referred to as "red points", which was a common wartime phrase for meat rationing, and Philip Marlowe had a special sticker on his car to say he's contributing to the war effort and can therefore be given more than eight gallons of gasoline per week. There's also a female cab driver featured &mdash; in a time when women had taken up a lot of the jobs left vacant by men fighting overseas (see the "1940s Literature" folder below for more details).

<ul><li> Marlowe and other characters express open disgust for homosexuals. They freely use homophobic slurs like "queen" and make jokes at their expense. After getting decked by a gay man, Marlowe asserts that it didn't hurt much because gay men "have no iron in their bones." All of this would be highly unusual in today's political climate.
</li><li> Geiger's pornography business is an underground criminal enterprise, and Marlowe is thoroughly disgusted by it. Today, porn is freely available online and more mainstream than ever.
</li><li> Marlowe's alcoholism, to an extent. There are several times in the novel where he takes a swig either while driving or about to start driving, and neither he nor anyone else thinks anything of it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s short story "History" says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> died on Madagascar.

U.S. Highway 66 was upgraded to freeway bypasses of many metropolitan areas, which were later assumed into the routes of the Interstate Highway System (mostly Interstates 40, 44, and 55). The number, by then assigned to a freeway routing that had almost no connection to the original Chicago-to-California route, was finally retired in 1985. However, many portions of the old routing are still present and contain signs or monuments honoring the route's legacy (parts of it are even signed with markers reading "Historic Route 66").
</li><li> The song "Why Don't You Do Right" refers to the year 1922 as being "twenty years ago", mathematically placing the story in the early 1940s or so. The 1961 cover by Julie London updates the year to 1941. However, the usual approach for modern performances seems to be to embrace the period and dress up the singer as a 1940s siren.

In the 1960s or 1970s, it'd be closer to this trope, but 1954 isn't a particularly sought-after year for any mainstream American car since styling tended to be at an awkward stage between the flowing Art Deco of the first postwar generation and the long, low finniness of the late '50s, and wheezy old flathead engines and flaky first-generation automatic transmissions proliferated.

<ul><li> The year stayed at 1956 in The Searchers cover in 1965 (which is the version often heard on oldies stations). This turns a three-year dry spell into a nine-year "I'd better step back and take a hard look at what's wrong with my life" serious problem.

"A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots is the wish of Barney and Ben." Setting aside the fact that very few children have been named "Barney" since the 1960s (the name "Ben", while still relatively common, is not as popular as it was at the time), a pistol would not be an appropriate Christmas gift for little boys in this day and age. Also, how many people singing the song these days even know what "Hopalong boots" <em>are</em>?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00nzc');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note00nzc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00nzc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They're basically cowboy boots modeled off of the ones worn by Hopalong Cassidy, a fictional cowboy hero popular in the fifties.

At least the line about "Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again" is still pretty relevant...

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BellsAreRinging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BellsAreRinging">Bells Are Ringing</a></em> necessarily takes place before the rise of answering machines, which had already begun in the 1960s. It has a subplot involving fake orders placed in bulk for recordings of classical music in "all three speeds" (33, 45 and 78 RPM, the latter of which died out around 1958). There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListSong">List Song</a> rattling off the names of 1950s celebrities (which, like a number of similar songs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColePorter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ColePorter">Cole Porter</a> musicals, had a few lines revised during the original Broadway run).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DamnYankees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DamnYankees">Damn Yankees</a></em>. Most obviously, the protagonist roots for and then plays for the original Washington Senators, which moved after 1960 to become the Minnesota Twins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FlowerDrumSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/FlowerDrumSong">Flower Drum Song</a></em> lays on the 1950s slang and fashions in music and dress a bit heavily. Immigration quotas complicate the love plot, which is resolved with the help of a TV western. The lyrics to "Chop Suey" are a laundry list of people and things popular in America at the time. Notably, the film adaptation made in 1961 changed the references to Bobby Darrin and Sandra Dee to make it seem more current.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LilAbner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LilAbner">Li'l Abner</a></em> is vintage 1950s satire about atomic bomb testing and scientific optimism. The song lyrics allude to a fair number of advertising slogans of the time; "Progress Is The Root Of All Evil," whose title is a cross between an old proverb and a General Electric slogan, is about 1950s trends and failing to keep up with them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMostHappyFella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMostHappyFella">The Most Happy Fella</a></em>, despite being set in the 1920s, is commonly supposed to take place in the 1950s, when it was written. This is largely because the musical deliberately dropped the contemporary political topics of the 1924 play on which it was based, including all references to Prohibition.
</li><li> John Osborne's plays <em>Look Back in Anger</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheEntertainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheEntertainer">The Entertainer</a></em> were cutting edge in their coarse language and format, depiction of working-class Englishmen and the seedier side of British culture, ushering in the "Angry Young Man" era in British literature. They have a much more mixed reputation today, partly through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a> but also their dated topicality. Particularly true of <em>The Entertainer</em>, whose plot focuses on the long-defunct music hall tradition and myriad references to the Suez Crisis of 1956.

If the short were made even just a decade or so later, it would need to go out of its way to explain why the construction worker couldn't resolve the plot in two minutes by taking the frog home and recording it on a cheaper and more user-friendly Super 8 camera, to say nothing of the plot being resolved in twenty seconds with a smartphone if it took place in the modern day. Especially apparent when the final scene takes place in the far future but ends up looking pretty dated not only by its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">very '50s vision of the future</a> but also by ending on the implication that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">the cycle will repeat with a new victim</a>, rather than an implication of him simply recording the routine and becoming rich.

The comic was mainly a gag strip with a main character that had an unclear mind and encyclopedic knowledge. Pretty much 90% of the jokes in those comics would barely even work well (unless you can still laugh with jokes about people that mock old cars that have cars themselves that scream the 1960s). The dialogue is also unbelievably dated, not helped by the fact that the comic used a complex vocabulary for its time (the Spanish translator of the comic had to come up with a new joke whenever the original joke didn't translate well into Spanish) and a lot of neologisms that don't catch on with modern viewers.
</li><li> In <em>The Beaver Patrol </em>, another Franco-Belgian comic, the 5 main characters are invited by the Iranian government for a vacation. This story (published in two parts entitled <em>The Haunted Bus</em> and <em>The Ghost</em>) was written in 1967 and 1969, at a time Iran was still on friendly terms with the West. The Iranians were portrayed in positive light, while the Kurds were portrayed as savage raiders. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and 9/11, those portrayal were reversed in Western media.

<ul><li> Miss Kubelik's occupation as an elevator operator was already pretty archaic at the time, and has now become completely extinct except for very old buildings.
</li><li> The fact that new episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUntouchables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUntouchables">The Untouchables</a></em> are airing is a plot point; <em>The Untouchables</em> would air its last new episode in May 1963.

You would also not find an airport even two decades later with security as lax as in the film's climax, where a character is able to carry a gun in and out of an airplane and through an airport without anyone noticing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolHandLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolHandLuke">Cool Hand Luke</a></em>, despite being technically set in the 1950s, instantly feels more associated with the 60s. The applicability to the Vietnam War is everywhere &mdash; especially with its anti-establishment themes, and Luke being a disaffected former soldier. The film's famous line &mdash; "what we got here is a failure to communicate" &mdash; has been interpreted as a metaphor for Vietnam. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> felt the film was a huge product of its time.

Instead, they sing like a barbershop quartet. Suffice it to say that a Beatles-style number would have aged far better, but considering that barbershop dates back to the early 1880s while the Beatles were still a fairly new fad, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">how was Walt to know that?</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeepingTom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeepingTom">Peeping Tom</a></em> is instantly recognizable as an early '60s piece from the fashion and vibrant color palette &mdash; which resembles the notable pop art of the era. Pornography is portrayed as a secretive thing that a respectable gentleman has to whisper for when the newsagents are empty &mdash; and it's paralleled to the protagonist's voyeurism. The film technology is also state of the art for the '60s, and Mark watches his films back on a projector &mdash; showing that it was made before videotape was invented.

When a newspaper reporter hears the tale of how Steve wound up renting a room from Catherine, he says he's going to write a juicy story about it. Then Catherine's fianc&eacute;e Julius, a low-ranking diplomat, decides that Steve and Catherine <em>have to get married</em> in order to avoid scandal and social embarrassment and damage to Julius's career. All because Steve rented out Catherine's guest bed. It's impossible to imagine the movie being made even a few years later when the swinging 1970s were underway and nobody would have batted an eye at such a living arrangement.

Also, many episodes mention then-extravagant amounts of money that would be considered rather paltry in the 2010s thanks to fifty years of inflation.

Nonetheless, the show criticizes Cold War power structures (with the major implication that Number Six's captors maybe his own "side" and his retirement from spy service as a "matter of conscience"), and has an overall tone that can only be described as 'psychedelic', features very 1960s fashions (most notably Number Six's jacket, the multicoloured capes seen on a few characters, and the prevalence of lava lamps). The finale includes (without giving away too much) the music of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> ("All You Need Is Love") and a character, thematically representing universal youth culture, calling everyone "dad" or "baby".

This reference to a time before light novels became readily accessible overseas, and the sheer amount of name-dropping of other novel series that were popular at the time, places this series firmly in the early 2010s.

Today, it seems a bit odd for Jimmy to be so obsessed with a mainstream brand and have such a hard time getting it.

</li><li> The Irish film <em>Dive</em> was filmed in 2017 and released in 2018, but became dated immediately after its first week. The reason? The plot deals with a champion swimmer who becomes pregnant. Abortion was illegal in Ireland since the signing of the 8th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which gave the unborn fetus the same rights as a living human, thereby making abortion illegal, in September of 1983. That amendment was repealed exactly one week after the premiere of the film.

Just a few months after its release, she became one of the biggest public faces of Operation Varsity Blues, in which a massive college admissions fraud was exposed, resulting in Jade and her sister dropping out of college before their inevitable expulsion and her reputation and career being perhaps permanently destroyed.

The review called it "a ferociously shameless time capsule of 2010 pop culture."
</li><li> The New Zealand-made film <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592531/">The Holy Roller<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">sadly become this</a>, thanks to the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011.

By the time the film was released in 2012, she was already at the tail end of her fame and was only taken seriously by her supporters; the entire joke was about how ridiculous the idea of Palin becoming President would be. Nowadays, she's barely a blip on the cultural and political radar, rendering the joke quite dated.

A common theme in many reviews was how "of the moment" the subject matter was in how it built itself entirely around its portrayal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia">New Media</a>.
</li><li> <em>L.A.

What makes it particularly notable is the fact that, while it was released in 2015, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShelfOfMovieLanguishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShelfOfMovieLanguishment">after a long period sitting on the shelf</a>, most of the targets of its satire (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenMom">Teen Mom</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a>, and a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a>) had already ceased to be relevant by the time it was filmed... in <strong>2012</strong>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchPerfect">Pitch Perfect</a></em>, released in 2012, showcased the emergence of what would be eventually termed as "pop feminism", from its theme of empowerment to the "anti-rape whistle" joke, while the antagonists are the stereotypical 2000s-era fratboys.

Many of its protagonist Connor's tribulations are exaggerated versions of real things that Bieber did during that time that helped make him a tabloid punchline. There are also jokes about smart devices, hoverboards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Macklemore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Macklemore">Macklemore</a>'s "Same Love", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound</a>, and Apple's heavy-handed promotion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>'s 2014 album <em>Songs of Innocence</em>, while Connor's girlfriend Ashley Wednesday is the star of a film franchise adapted from a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungAdultLiterature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungAdultLiterature">YA novels</a>.

</li><li> Ernest Cline's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReadyPlayerOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReadyPlayerOne">Ready Player One</a></em>, published in 2011, is set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> but otherwise reflects much of the worldview of the late 2000s/early 2010s time period in which it was written and grew popular, most notably the prevalence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">nostalgia</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> (it takes place largely in a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualWorlds">virtual world</a> rooted in its creator's '80s nostalgia) and the ascendancy of the internet and geek culture within the mainstream during that time. Of particular note is how this trope affected the book's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReadyPlayerOne2018">film adaptation in 2018</a>, by which point Silicon Valley tech companies and geek culture had been embroiled in various controversies that clouded the once unambiguously positive view that many people had of them. The resulting film (which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfAdaptation">co-written by Cline</a>) wound up softening the specific '80s focus of the OASIS in favor of a broader pool of pop culture references, as well as toning down some of Wade's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerd</a> tendencies and giving a more morally gray take on the OASIS' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveJobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveJobs">Steve Jobs</a>-esque creator James Halliday.

<ul><li> A funny one occurred on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> when the subject of one episode involved Libyan government agents sent by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> killing a rebel propagandist and trying to use his identity to lure the rebel leadership into an ambush. Obviously written and filmed when the Libyan Civil War seemed (from the outside) to be deadlocked, by the time the episode aired on October 11, 2011, the rebels would be more properly called "the Libyan government", having been recognized as such internationally in September, with Gaddafi the one on the run who should be wary of ambushes (he would be captured and killed just nine days after the episode aired, on October 20). The references to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring">The Arab Spring</a> also clearly date the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS">House of Cards (US)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite beginning in 2013, the show's portrayal of the US Congress was pretty clearly based on its makeup before 2010. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Francis Underwood</a> is initially portrayed as a "Blue Dog" Democrat<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12ejqs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12ejqs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12ejqs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "Blue Dogs" are the moderate-to-conservative Southern wing of the party, composed mainly of those Southern Democrats who didn't cross the aisle to the Republicans during the '80s and '90s but still trended to the right of the national Democratic Party's positions</span> from South Carolina who serves as the Majority Whip of the House of Representatives since the Democrats are the majority party in the House when the show begins. The "wave" elections of 2010 and 2014 saw virtually all the Blue Dog Democrats swept from both chambers of Congress and replaced with Tea Party Republicans, and the Democratic Party wouldn't gain control of the House again until 2018, now dominated by unabashedly left-leaning figures.
</li><li> In general, some <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/30/15694916/house-of-cards-review-season-5-netflix">reviewers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> have argued that the show's depiction of American politics is pretty dated to the pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Trump</a> era. The show is known for its deeply cynical attitude towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">American Political System</a>'s "consensus politics" that followed the Cold War, generally portraying the Republican and Democratic parties as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">interchangeable</a> groups of establishment figureheads who care more about money and power than about the people they're supposed to represent, and only want to maintain the <em>status quo</em> at all costs. That attitude <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">quickly went out of fashion</a> as the Tea Party and Occupy movements that sprung as a reaction to "neocons" and "neolibs" gained political influence and became finally obliterated after Donald Trump's highly controversial election and presidency brought political polarization to new heights and led to a new wave of active political engagement on both sides of the aisle.
</li><li> The presidential election in the middle of the fifth season (released in 2017) firmly weds it to the previous year's real-life presidential election, with the fictional FBI director stating that the bureau "would never involve itself in a presidential election" while all but staring to the camera.
</li><li> Walker's resignation at the end of season 2 while facing impeachment over a minor crime would be a hard sell after Donald Trump's impeachment in 2019, which failed to remove him from office. Most people would think "Walker would never be impeached for such a small crime" (or at least "There's no way he would voluntarily resign") given the nature of the allegations against Trump, and the fact that his own party ultimately stood by him.
</li></ul></li><li> In season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle">The Middle</a></em>, Frankie obsesses over the "Royal Wedding" of William and Kate, firmly fixing the episode in 2011.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BroadCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BroadCity">Broad City</a></em> has a semi-gentrified aesthetic that could date it badly, there are a few moments that stand out as very 2010s:
<ul><li> In a Season 1 episode, Lincoln tells a gay character "I'm not getting married until everyone can get married", dating it to before 2015.
</li><li> The montage in the first episode of Season 3 features Abby wearing a white and gold dress at the same time as Ilana wearing a blue and black dress, referencing the meme from early 2015.
</li><li> A Season 3 episode shows Ilana temporarily working at Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign headquarters, instantly dating the episode to 2016.
</li><li> A couple of episodes in Season 4 immediately date to 2017: In the first instance, Ilana gets upset when she has to remove her impractical Obama-themed nails ("It's like they're leaving office all over again!"). She then realizes in the latter episode that she hadn't been able to have an orgasm since Trump was elected. Speaking of the Donald, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">his name</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensoredForComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensoredForComedy">is censored every time it's spoken aloud</a> for the entire season.
</li></ul></li><li> The pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Terriers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Terriers">Terriers</a></em> has a smartphone with a sex tape on it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, and the novelty of it being able to record video is repeatedly remarked upon, putting it firmly in the tail end of the 2000s/beginning of the 2010s.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>, practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">everybody's cellphone is a Blackberry</a>, and there's a noticeable shift from using the ones with tactile switch keypads to touchscreen phones between seasons 3 and 4, firmly rooting the series in the early 2010s when Blackberry began to abandon its flagship product. There are more intentional references to the time period, like the "Got Your Six" lapel pins, Pete and Claudia's fondness of internet memes, and of course newspaper dates, but the transition from cellphones to smartphones was something the writers couldn't have planned for.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Season 2 episode "Sister City" features a group of delegates from Venezuela visiting Pawnee as part of an exchange program, with the episode openly mocking Venezuela's then-President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez. Ch&aacute;vez died in office just four years after that episode aired, instantly dating it. The same episode subtly references the Venezuelan economic boom that occurred during Chavez's tenure, with the delegation frequently bragging about their town's prosperity, and showing off their wealth by spending money in frivolous ways; this instantly became dated after Venezuela's economy collapsed during Nicol&aacute;s Maduro's presidency, and the country's economic hardships subsequently became the subject of many headlines.
</li><li> In general, the show's characters and premise are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xyw5v/parks-and-recreation-is-the-america-we-were-promised-hillary-clinton-leslie-knope-essay">a pretty good encapsulation of the social and political climate of America in the early-2010s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The cheery bureaucrat Leslie Knope is largely a poster girl for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Obama</a>-era liberalism, to the point that she keeps a portrait of then-Secretary of State <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a> framed in her office. Her boss Ron Swanson, meanwhile, is largely reflective of America's then-burgeoning libertarian block, which championed "small government" conservatism while supporting socially liberal policies (particularly LGBT rights). Both factions took a pretty big beating in the following years, as the libertarians were (for the moment) eclipsed by the rise of a more reactionary brand of conservative populism with the Tea Party-led 2014 midterm elections and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s 2016 campaign, while Leslie's idol Hillary Clinton faced an unexpected progressive movement led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernieSanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernieSanders">Bernie Sanders</a> and was eventually defeated by Trump in one of the biggest political upsets in American history. But this in turn <em>has</em> been somewhat subverted (at least for Leslie's side) as of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTwenties">2020</a>, when Leslie's <em>other</em> favorite politician, then-Vice President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>, is the one running against Trump, albeit with slightly more progressive policies than his former Obama-era liberalism (largely due to the influence of progressives such as Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the party platform).

In time, both answers will be equally outdated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamQueens2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamQueens2015">Scream Queens (2015)</a></em>'s second season heavily dates itself to 2016.

Denise goes into a coma and wakes up asking how Hillary Clinton is doing as the first female president &mdash; as the series aired while the presidential election was going on.

A first-season episode feels like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a> version of the Snowden case, but predates it by over a year.

When the show premiered in 2014, it presented its protagonists more or less sympathetically, as geniuses on the path to success whose lives within the cultural bubble that was Silicon Valley made them, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">puffed-up egos</a>, and their antisocial behavior merely quirky. By the time of the show's final season in 2019, when tech companies ranging from giants like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> and Amazon to unicorn startups like Uber and WeWork had been battered by a seemingly ceaseless tide of controversy, its tone, while still comedic, was a lot less sympathetic to its characters. Their idealistic attitude about saving the world through technology was portrayed as increasingly hollow, easily discarded, and perhaps misguided from the start, and the question was not if their start-up company Pied Piper would be successful, but when and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">it would all come crashing down</a>.

Though there were plenty of songs that were dated when they were performed on the show, the use of music that had just gotten big (or in some cases, music that got big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">from being on the show</a>) firmly entrenches each season in the years it came out. Beyond that, the pop culture references and optimistic outlook very much reflects the Obama era surrounding it similar to <em>Parks and Rec</em> above.
</li><li> An episode of the first series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rev">Rev</a></em> managed to become this <em>between filming and broadcast</em>. The plot of the episode revolved around Adam becoming jealous of a fellow reverend with a high media profile and trying to build one himself by appearing on <em>The One Show</em> (an early evening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagazineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagazineShow">Magazine Show</a> in the UK), with presenters Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley appearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Themselves</a>. Unfortunately, several months before the episode was broadcast, Chiles and Bleakley both defected to rival network ITV and were no longer presenting the show by the time it aired.

The song's premise of an older man pleading for a job is clearly a reflection of the zeitgeist of the Great Recession. In addition, the national US average for a gallon of gas fell into the $2.00-$2.50 range soon after.

The biggest is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DMCDevilMayCry">reboot version</a> of Dante, whose game underperformed significantly the following year, but similar things could be said of the heavy representation given to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infamous">Infamous</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killzone">Killzone</a></em>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em>, none of whom fared especially well after 2012.

Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MediEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MediEvil">Sir Daniel Fortesque's</a> appearance made little sense at the time (a decently big name on the PlayStation in his day, to be sure, but his last original outing was in early 2000) but would turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">oddly prophetic</a> years later.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">International Olympic Committee</a> announced the Games will still keep the 2020 name, keeping the game fresh for an additional year.

Later when Matt brings up a then-current event of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> having lost millions of dollars, Pat comments "wow you're really dating this video now."

By the fourth anniversary of the article's publication, Trump had been inaugurated as the President of the United States &mdash; something that the authors of the article clearly never imagined. The article was irreversibly dated to the period between 2008-2015 when Trump was most famous for being a reality show host and real estate mogul, as well as his conspiracy theories surrounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>. Technically, however, everything in the article still has the potential to become reality; just with radically different contexts surrounding Trump.

The story on its own is well written, but the massive amount of references to concerns in 2016 immediately dates it to that year. The story takes place in a dystopian future, during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s third term as US president, where after a war with Mexico (which leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>), the government has set up a military unit composed exclusively of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier">teenagers</a>. While Trump did get elected and fears of war were widespread, these mostly had to do with North Korea and Russia, as after Trump's election, Mexico made it clear that they do not take him seriously at all, meaning that a war would be unnecessary. As the story progresses, it is revealed that to get children to join the army, the government set up "Destromons Go", a thinly-veiled parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pok&eacute;mon GO</a></em> (which is still popular today, but not to the same extent as when it was first released in 2016) and spawned extremely rare and powerful monsters at specific battle sites (with the titular Arctic Lizard being one that the protagonist has). As many were exasperated with the game's fanbase during its run, leading to a stereotype of the game's players being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> people caring only about Pok&eacute;mon, the story also contains multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">jabs towards the game</a>, especially at the climax, where the protagonist manages to successfully finish off the second-in-command of Al Qaeda but is quickly forgotten after his unit learns that one of the other soldiers found a rare monster at the same site.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> tends to fall into this trope, both because the story was essentially a long conversation with its author and the audience, and because the comic itself was heavily shaped by internet culture (which changes very rapidly), with a large chunk of the story being told through online interactions between the characters. Earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call Backs</a> and gags came from Hussie's writings in the early 2000s, but a good chunk of the story was written in the 2010s. As a result, many references both significant and otherwise became outdated. Whenever kids talk about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme">Discredited Memes</a>, they usually mention that the joke fell out of favor a few years before the start of the comic (2009).

The extremely interactive meta-narrative of the story can also point to this era, as a lot of contemporary media at this time had some sort of self-aware, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troperiffic">Troperiffic</a> angle to it.

It featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personifications</a> of the sites. However, at the time Tumblr was a relatively new and niche website most well-known for its hipster and fashion blogs run by 20-somethings. While Tumblr still has a strong fashion blog fanbase, the image of the website has changed drastically. It's more associated with political, LGBT, and fandom blogs run by young teens joining those 20-somethings on the site.

Episodes 1 to 4, in particular, tend to show off the style of humor and references that were popular in the year they were released in, with references to several properties that were popular or had a ton of attention at the time, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EpicMealTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EpicMealTime">Epic Meal Time</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeamFourStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeamFourStar">Takahata101</a> even considers the <em>Epic Meal Time</em> reference cringeworthy because of it, and KaiserNeko isn't a fan of their portrayal of Rip Van Winkle (a meme-spouting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie">Soapbox Sadie</a> who is essentially a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to 2013 Tumblr), considering it to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.

A notable example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParallelPornTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParallelPornTitles">Gnardians</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">of the Galaxy</a></em>, in which the "Drax" parody makes fun of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a> for not making a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em> movie &mdash; by the time of the Snob review, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman (2017)</a></em> was just weeks from release, a fact which the Snob was more than happy to snark on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobChipman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobChipman">Bob Chipman</a> discussed this trope in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/the-movies-of-the-2010s-decade-the-big-picture/">this episode<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em>The Big Picture</em>, dedicated to the movies, good and bad, that he felt defined and best reflected the culture of the 2010s. He brought up how "cultural decades" rarely correspond to the actual calendar years, noting how most of what pop-culture remembers as "the '60s" came during the years 1964-72, treating the first third of the decade as an extension of the 1950s while spilling over into the 1970s, and how "the '70s" were more or less over by 1978 depending on where one lived.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/FreeSpirit2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/FreeSpirit2014">Free Spirit</a></em> mostly averts this by using references to 70's and 80's pop culture to fit with the time period in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreeSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreeSpirit">the show it adapts</a> is set, but sometimes, then-current events are referenced to adapt the show to a modern setting:

However, by the middle of the 2010s, reality TV was becoming much less popular, and while <em>Survivor</em> is still running as of 2020, it's not as relevant to modern pop culture as it once was, thus making what <em>Total Drama</em> was parodying in itself outdated.

Like the above example, this is something that was a phenomenon in the earlier half of the decade, as newer shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> eventually took attention away from the franchise.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17kl3f');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17kl3f" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17kl3f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The franchise isn't completely dead, however, since it got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheTeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheTeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">another reboot on Nickelodeon</a> not long after.</span>
</li><li> "BBBDay!" had a subplot about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyBirthdayToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyBirthdayToYou">how singing the "Happy Birthday" song will get you into legal trouble</a>. Months after that episode aired, "Happy Birthday" was declared to be in the public domain.
</li><li> "Teen Titans Roar!" is a spoof of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThundercatsRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThundercatsRoar">Thundercats Roar</a></em> controversy that occurred in 2018 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationLeadTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationLeadTime">and was dated</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">even when it came out</a> since the episode premiered in 2020, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryHatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryHatedom">Periphery Hatedom</a> for <em>Thundercats Roar</em> was beginning to die off.
</li><li> Several episodes reference then-popular dance moves like twerking (which also appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGoToTheMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGoToTheMovies">Teen Titans Go! To the Movies</a></em>) and flossing (during a musical number in "The Chaff").
