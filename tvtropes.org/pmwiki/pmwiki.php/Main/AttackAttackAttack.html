<ul><li> Deconstructed/Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter &times; Hunter</a></em>. The main character Gon does this, and at first it's seen as beneficial in situations where endurance is the criteria for winning rather than physical strength. (For example, an early one-on-one fight has the condition that the opponents fight until one consciously declares defeat. Killing is not allowed. Gon is paired against a stronger opponent, with the result being torture endurance rather than an actual duel. Gon wins.) However, over time this is explored more in-depth as a character flaw, since he fights recklessly in situations where it's detrimental as well. In fact, the most successful victories in the series are often the result of carefully thought out strategies, and awareness of any potential weaknesses an opponent might have.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, Integra often gives Alucard such an order to dispatch their enemies, or as she likes to phrase it, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Search and Destroy!</a>"
</li><li> The <em>Mazinger</em> series:
<ul><li> Kouji Kabuto of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> falls into this sometimes, when he is facing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Mechanical Beast</a> several times stronger than his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> and still he refuses retiring or playing defensive. However, he still is able to think strategically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">come up with plans quickly</a>, and every so often you can talk him into leaving the battlefield, so he is not the biggest offender in the series.
<ul><li> In his battle against Jeiser J1 his enemy was too sturdy to be taken down easily, his mecha was quickly running out of power, the mechanisms were so strained that the controls were giving off sparks and the cockpit was filling with smoke, and he was risking a freefall (since they were fighting in midair)... and still he refused going back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeBase">Home Base</a>, waiting for a chance to nail the Beast instead.
</li></ul></li><li> That one would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>'s Tetsuya Tsurugi, who is a hard-headed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> who never, <em>ever</em>, retires.
<ul><li> In the <em>Great Mazinger vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter Robo</a></em> feature, Tetsuya tried all Great Mazinger's weapons against an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. Neither did work, and the monster ripped off his mecha's arms and melted one leg. What Tetsuya did? Trying <em>headbutting</em> it.
</li><li> In one of the first episodes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">Kenzo Kabuto</a> had to actually threaten him with (what was to Tetsuya) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>: "Return to the Fortress NOW or else you will be out of Great Mazinger... permanently".
</li><li> In his climatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordFight">Sword Fight</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Great General of Darkness, his mecha was damaged and running out of power and he was badly hurt after a battle when he was informed that the Great General of Darkness -the biggest villain badass of the Mazinverse- was approaching to challenge him. Everyone exhorted him to run away. What did Tetsuya do? Picking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">two swords</a> and meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>'s challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> In both series - plus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> -, the only method the army is capable to think to stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robeast">Robeasts</a> is attacking them endlessly, and <em>when</em> it fails, send more troops in. They DID get one sucess in the GosakuOta Mazinger-Z manga, though, but they needed a nuke to achieve it. You would think that after the first few times they would learn that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEqualsInvincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEqualsInvincible">Giant Equals Invincible</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>: Take Kenshiro (or some of his allies, like his friend Rei or his brother Toki). Take an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a>. One or several mooks will attack Kenshiro, and they SHALL die in a awful and extremely painful way, usually by exploding, as Kenshiro remains unfazed and nearly always untouched. Most of time their partners's reaction will be attacking Kenshiro in spite of having just seen that is suicidal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Few times they will choose fleeing, even if Kenshiro suggests that option. And then you have the exceptionally dumb, arrogant mook who knows what Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Seiken martial artists are capable of, and still wants to fight them.</a>
<ul><li> Let's talk about Spade. In the second chapter Kenshiro ran into him and his goons were torturing an old man to steal his bag of rice. When Kenshiro intervened, Spade shot an arrow at him, and Kenshiro stopped it easily. Kenshiro informed him that he would only take his eye -instead of killing him- if he tried that again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">Spade tried it again</a> with predictable consequences. Kenshiro though spared his life... and he attacked him again. Spade, lad, there are less painful ways to commit suicide!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> has Sanosuke, a Zanbato-wielder-turned-fistfighter who has consciously chosen to build a fighting style based on nothing but attacking. After being beaten a few times by a 'rival,' said rival criticizes Sanosuke for having no defensive moves; he just keeps attacking until he wins or is too badly injured to continue. Sanosuke's response is to learn how to attack HARDER. Then there's Enishi; even before he fights Kenshin, he's already decided that he will kill Kenshin or die trying, because in the past <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kenshin had killed his sister Tomoe - the only person he ever cared about - and he feels he has nothing left but vengeance</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em>: Joe "The Condor" Asakura is an aggresive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> whose only strategy is attacking the enemy until they all are dead.

He presses the button again until they have run out of missiles). Even in scouting or infiltrating missions where they must be stealth instead of not engaging the enemy, he is always asking why they are NOT blowing them up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter">Soul Hunter</a></em>: Nataku first and only solution against anything is to attack it with as much power as possible until it is defeated.

<ul><li> Also the Seibu Wild Gunmen, who have incredibly strong offense. They could play defensively and stop their opponents from scoring a bit more, but they prefer playing aggressively for turnovers to get more points.
</li><li> And inverted by the Ojou White Knights, which rely on extremely talented defenses.
</li><li> The Hakushuu Dinosaurs are another offensive oriented team, relying on the power of their centre, Gaou, to force their way down the field, and breaking other teams' quarterbacks instead of playing fairly. Oddly enough, two of their best players are their safety (who doubles as the quarterback) and their cornerback. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Marco</a> may believe in the offense, but he makes sure he's got all his bases covered.

<ul><li> Ippo however, actually has a <em>phenomenal</em> defense. This is contrasted by Sendo, who has almost no defense and doesn't mind taking hits if he can dish out something in turn. Hell, he loves boxing precisely because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatSadomasochist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatSadomasochist">he likes "hitting and getting hit"</a>. He has the advantage that you can't make him retreat or step back.
</li><li> In the first movie Ippo even proclaimed he will lose to his opponent, Kazuki Sanada, if he even stops assaulting him for a second as it would break his rhythm and leave him open. Hitting like a freighter train onto the defending Kazuki he thinks only about "Attack, Attack and Attack even more!"
</li><li> Takamura goes completely apeshit when he get's knocked out and is forced to Muscle-Memory Box. he was trained in an extremely orthodox style of boxing, which sharply contrasted hie opponent's wild and untrained style. The scary part was Takamura was aiming for LETHAL attacks with each hit. The man was launching temple shots and liver blows like he was born to do it despite being completely out of it and barely aware of his actions.

As his teammates point out, Allen fights twice as many Akuma as everyone else, and will continue to attack head-on no matter how much shit is getting beat out of him (usually a lot).

She wouldn't even retreat when her EVA had an arm cut off, its skull cracked open and a large gaping hole in its side.

</li></ul></li><li> Played with multiple ways in the war manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kingdom">Kingdom</a></em>:
<ul><li> Moubu starts off as this, fully confident in his strength and his army's overwhelming charge. He is thoroughly outplayed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Riboku</a>, and it ends up in a costly defeat. He later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">becomes more strategic</a>, although his favoured technique is still brute force.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Shin</a> also tends to use this approach, and similar to Moubu it works against him for a while until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Karyoten</a> becomes his strategist.
</li><li> On the other hand, it works quite well for Duke Hyou, who combines it with his instincts to smell out the perfect weakpoint to attack. It is noted that he has a very high mortality rate of soldiers though.
</li><li> It also works for Akou, but he has the benefit of being able to simply replicate the orders of his commander and strategic genius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Ousen</a> when he needs something different.

<ul><li> Fate's minions suffer from a rather nasty case of this; it works against Negi's partners, most of whom have no idea how to fight, but when faced with people with actual combat experience, they get their butts kicked.
</li><li> Jack Rakan also acts like this, but he gets away with it because he's so powerful that there are only half a dozen people in existence who can actually hurt him.
</li></ul></li><li> In the "El Baile de la Muerte" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>, a bunch of mooks are hired by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleManagementMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleManagementMook">hitman hired by Roberta</a> to flush out a Special Forces outfit. They are totally outclassed and outgunned, but their leader tells them to keep fighting, because they've lost too many people for this to be pointless. He repeats it until it practically becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">Madness Mantra</a>.
</li><li> Rock Lee from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. To the point where he was knocked unconscious from the pain from a shattered leg and arm, and broken spine, and had trained himself to the point where he could still fight unconscious. While he isn't averse of actual strategy or defense, his major attack tactic really is direct damage.
</li><li> A favorite tactic of Black Star in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>. He takes it up another notch with 'Speed Star' mode, and another 5 notches in 'Fey Blade' mode.
</li><li> This is the philosophy that defines Guts' life in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>.
<ul><li> His enemies fall prey to it as well. One particular example has him and another (already wounded) character surrounded by a small army of foes. He tells her to run for help while he holds them off. By the end time she returns with reinforcements, Guts is standing against a tree, wounded and exhausted, surrounded by the bloody corpses of around a hundred dead soldiers. Only at one point during this battle do the soldiers question if it's wise to continue attacking someone who has already cut through dozens of men as if they were hot butter, before resuming the attack.
</li></ul></li><li> The trademark strategy of the eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yaiba">Yaiba</a></em>. Of course, if this doesn't work he's more than capable of finding out a solution against his foes.
</li><li> Luffy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> plays this straight or averts it depending on the situation. His main strategy is to hit the other guy as much as he can and as fast as he can, and if it's a fight he feels he has to win, he does just that. That said, he's not at all opposed to running away from a pointless or unwinnable fight (and does so pretty often) so long as it doesn't mean abandoning any of his friends.
<ul><li> Also Ace (and mentioned his father as well), had a "never run from a fight" attitude. However it was because of this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ace died at the hands of Akainu</span>.

</li><li> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion">3-gatsu no Lion</a></em>, this is essentially how the protagonist Rei describes his peer Issa's play style in shogi, where he focuses on offensive maneuvers and none on defensive ones.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gamaran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gamaran">Gamaran</a></em>, the Ichinose style (a clan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Oodachi users</a> from which one of the main characters comes from) involves highly offensive tactics focusing on fast sweeps. According to Ranmaru, thanks to this tireless, implacable style the first Ichinose clan leader was able to emerge victorious from any battle. Specifically, Zenmaru also focused his efforts in learning the "Blazing Flame Form" of the Ogame Ryu, mixing the above mentioned fighting style with extremely strong attacks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Jonouchi's duel with Kaiba was this. After Kaiba had destroyed Jonouchi's "Armored Lizard" (1500 ATK) with his "Battle Ox" (1700 ATK), Jonouchi summoned "Flame Swordsman" (1800 ATK) and attacked, but "Battle Ox" was resistent against FIRE monsters (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> that doesn't work in the real life game). After Kaiba <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fusion summoned</a> "Rabid Horseman" (2000 ATK), Jonouchi kept summoning <em>weaker monsters and attacking with them</em>. He summoned only one moster in defense position ("Rock Ogre Grotto #1" (800 ATK / 1200 DEF)), and finally destroyed "Rabid Horseman" with his new "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" (2400 ATK), but Kaiba summoned "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000 AK) and discreased Jonouchi's Life Points to 0.
<ul><li> During the final in Yami Yugi's last duel against Insector Haga, he attacks him with his monster Breaker the Magical Warrior (Haga 3700 -&gt; 2200 Life Points). Then he activates the Quick-Play Spell Card "Berserker Soul" (that doesn't exist in real life), discarding his Hand and selecting "Breaker the Magical Warrior" as the target for "Berserker Soul". Yami can now draw cards from the top of his Deck until he reaches a Magic/Trap Card which will be added to his hand. For each drawn card that is a monster, he can discard it to the Graveyard to have "Breaker the Magical Warrior" attack an additional time. The first two cards he draws and discards are "Queen's Knight" and "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts". This allows "Breaker the Magical Warrior" to attack twice more. (Haga 2200 &rarr; 700 &rarr; 0 Life Points). Blinded by rage, Yami doesn't stop attacking. He continues to draw and discard six more cards, all of which turn out to be monsters. "Breaker the Magical Warrior" attacks six more times (Haga 0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 &rarr; 0 Life Points). Yami draws yet another Monster Card. He is about to discard it as well when Anzu stops him, pointing out he already won. Yami then realizes that the last card he drew was "Dark Magician Girl".
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">real-life Berserker Soul</a> actually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMh8UsZJKc8">can do this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

</li><li> Kirito from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> puts this trope to very good use, which favors his aggressive fighting style. Your friends and love-interest threatened by a dangerous floor boss that's already killed several others? Reveal that you have the exclusive in game ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wield</a> swords, and proceed to unleash a 16-Hit Combo called Starburst Stream to inflict massive DPS damage and defeat the boss! Facing one of the best players in a different game who possesses a sword that ignores any defense you have? Create a momentary distraction, borrow someone's weapon, and proceed to dual wield without game assistance and go hard on the offensive so that your foe doesn't even have a chance to attack. Facing a constantly respawning horde of enemies as part of a supposed endgame event in an attempt to rescue his girlfriend? Go all out and charge through them! The only time this seemingly hasn't worked for Kirito, is when his opponents either cheat through some unfair advantage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by say, being the Administrator of the games themselves and having in game immortality, or using blatantly game-breaking abilities</span>, or because his foes are very defense oriented tanks. Though sometimes it <em>barely</em> works, like when he defeats the boss The Gleam Eyes with only a tiny sliver of his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> remaining.
<ul><li> Kirito's almost entire party ends up doing this during the Excaliber's quest. The guy's tactic is "attack as hard as you can!" so everyone but Sinon (the archer) rushes the enemies. Admittedly, this was mostly because the quest had a strict time limit and more tactical approaches would have taken too much time.

<ul><li> Among experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> players, this rarely works. A good player will recognize that it is only a good idea to launch an all-out attack when the position calls for it, and often a large part of a game will be spent maneuvering to create such a position. An ill-advised and reckless attack will almost always be fended off by a skilled player, usually leaving the attacker overextended and in serious trouble. <br><br>However, before modern theory and strategy were refined, and defensive skills were not nearly as common, many of the masters of the 18th and 19th centuries would play like this, often leading to spectacular victories. Although even back then, it would backfire a decent amount of the time. An aphorism used by the German master Adolf Anderssen was "Attack! Always attack!"

<ul><li> A lot of tabletop games tend to promote this mindset by simplifying and abstracting the complex realities of combat into &#147;hit point&#148; systems that let you attack with full efficiency until you fall over and die. For that matter, often the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> will have NPC enemies be very aggressive and unwilling to flee or surrender.

As your opponents will thus likely be on the attack themselves, running away will just give them free shots at your retreating backs, and magical or ultra-tech healing will likely bring you back to full effectiveness so long as you survive and win the fight, unrelenting attack is often the optimum tactic. Systems that encourage more subtle approaches thus have to work to convince players.

In older background, the reason is explained thus:
<div class="indent"><em>Griznak didn't mind the death. He was an Ork. The senseless waste of life didn't appall him. He applauded it. He lived to fight. Fighting was what life was all about. Death was part of fighting, everybody knew that, from the youngest Wildboy to the oldest Nob. Every Ork accepted death the way he accepted the possibility of a buggy accident. It was what happened to someone else. And if it did happen to you, so what? Your soul went back to Gork and Mork to be belched into another body so you could fight again.</em> (<em>Codex: Imperialis</em>)
</div></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">background material</a> explains that Orks actually grow from spores released by decaying Ork corpses. In other words, getting killed is essential to their reproduction.
</li><li> Khorne Berserkers (<em>especially</em> the entire World Eaters Legion) and the Blood Angels Death Company... ah, well, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">names</a></em> of those should give a hint as to why they're examples of this trope.
</li><li> Black Templars Space Marines. Most armies would run away when taking casualties...Black Templars <em>move towards the enemy</em> when they lose men.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>:
<ul><li> The disadvantage "On The Edge" causes this to an almost comical degree. The example given involves using a toothbrush to fight people with guns. But, well... that's more about roleplaying a character with clinical depression that manifests in not caring whether he lives or dies. "On the Edge" means that the character does things that may appear to be courageous, to people who do not understand what's happening, but when the character stares down a street gang armed only with a toothbrush, he's actually trying to die. "On the Edge" is more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> kind of thing, though it's certainly possible in GURPS to be both "On the Edge" and a berserker &#151; Berserk being a separate disadvantage that triggers overtly aggressive unrelenting attacks.
</li><li> <em>GURPS Martial Arts</em> specifically advises against the GM promoting this mindset, noting that it wouldn't be fun or realistic. Thus, enemies who have taken a major wound should run away or surrender.
</li><li> Likewise, the GURPS-based <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DiscworldRoleplayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DiscworldRoleplayingGame">Discworld Roleplaying Game</a></em>, in line with the realistic, pragmatic attitudes of its source material, notes specifically that characters who&#146;ve lost a mere third or so of their hit points should usually be reconsidering their choices and thinking about flight or surrender. (And that despite the fact that GURPS characters generally have to be reduced some way below zero hit points before they actually die.) Fights to the death do happen, but they&#146;re extreme cases.
</li></ul></li><li> Background information on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">demons</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> usually depicts them as this. Based on their stats, they're far from stupid, but they enjoy hurting other things so much that they'll often continue fighting a losing battle just to hit you a few more times. And, to be fair, it bears mentioning that dying on the material plane is mostly a mild inconvenience for Outsiders.

Certain troop types are prone to Impetuosity, which means attacking the nearest enemy at sight without further orders. And without caring if they'd get their butts whipped or not. All Warbands and Irregular Knights are prone to this behaviour by default, and certain other types as well. All troops become Impetuous if a broken enemy is at 400 paces or closer.

</li><li> The Draconis Combine gets in on this as well; their zeal to be the first samurai to draw blood for the glory of the Dragon tends to get a lot of their more impetuous pilots separated from the bulk of their unit. Left unchecked, this tendency leads to situations where entire regiments rush out ahead of their support and get massacred by more securely emplaced defenders.

</li><li> In the Mouseguard and Torchbearer games, players script exactly three actions ahead, choosing from the options of Attack, Defend, Maneuver, and Feint. Of these, only Attack and Feint actually deal damage against an enemy, and Feint fails automatically if played against Attack. In complex battles there's some use to Maneuver to help set up other players, but 1v1s regularly result in players declaring, quite literally, "Attack / Attack / Attack".
</li><li> The <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CardGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CardGame/YuGiOh">Yu Gi Oh</a></em> card Berserk Gorilla uses this trope as a downside. It has 2000 ATK, which is well above the norm for its level (at the time it was released, the strongest card with no downside had 1900), but it must attack if possible, even if it'd be attacking something far stronger, and if it's switched into Defense, it self-destructs. Beatdown players of the time loved it, taking the view that if you were on the defensive while playing Berserk Gorilla, you were probably doing something wrong.

Generally, Oswald is played by ramming into an enemy at high speed, chaining attacks against it, and hoping it runs out of HP before you do. His fighting style reflects his characterization: he has next to no sense of self or sense of self-preservation, and can and will pick a fight with <em>anything</em> without any apparent care for his own survival.

This is mostly because they cannot afford to have the Soviets use the city as a beachhead for Chinese reinforcements, but partly because their commanding officer, Colonel Sawyer, feels it is necessary to redeem his failure in a previous mission. The fact that the city would be nuked by the US if Sawyer failed probably acted as a motivator too. And if the nuke hits the city, the afternotes tell that it led to an all-out nuclear war. Pretty good reasons to throw everything you got.

Since avoiding damage is almost impossible in all Borderlands games, killing the enemy before they overwhelm you is key to success. Combining this with healing weapons, and you can fire for days.
<ul><li> One notable exception to this rule is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Salvador</a>, who's entire skillset is based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">John Woo-ing</a> two guns, preferably high-damage, high firerate weapons with huge magazines, which also generates health <em>and</em> ammunition. As long as you keep firing, Salvador can take an army's worth of bullets and still keep coming.
</li><li> Some weapon brands are based around pointing a weapon roughly towards the enemy and keep the left mouse-button pressed. The fast-firing Vladof and the high damage but low accuracy Bandit are the best examples.
</li><li> Krieg is another notable exception, being a melee-focused character whose action skill recharges faster when he takes hp damage and fully heals him on a rampage kill. He wants to be right in the enemies face to eat the pain and keep the rampage going.

If there's an enemy, she <em>will</em> attack them whether you want her to or not. Susie believes anyone standing in their way should die and how dumb it is to try and make peace with someone who is trying to kill you. One boss battle becomes difficult since Susie attacking it makes it stronger and heal itself while Kris and Raslei were trying remove the boss's crown to depower it. After some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, Susie learns that sometimes ending a fight peacefully can be a better solution than attacking all the time and this is the point where she will start to obey your battle commands.

<ul><li> This seems to be the main strategy behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">firebending</a> in general, being fueled by anger and having few (if any) defensive techniques. Although he tries to seem sophisticated about it, Firelord Ozai for instance seems to rely on this, or twist his advisers' suggestions into this. This turns out to be a recent thing; the older style that Iroh uses and the heroes learn is based on internal balance.
</li><li> Earthbending similarly requires a head-on, no-hesitation strategy. While the inherent properties of earth make it quite practical for defense as well as attack, those same properties make it pretty obstinate to deal with, so a bender who isn't prepared to grab it by the metaphorical balls and make it his bitch isn't going to get very far, no matter what he plans to actually do with it. Almost all of the defensive moves are direct counters, like throwing up a wall in front of an incoming attack; there are none for evasion. That said, choosing your moment is also central to the style.

His punches have no effect on Butch, and Riley continues to get up after being knocked down, bloodied and even at one point <em>shaking on the ground because of the pain he's in</em>.
<ul><li> This seems to be a personality quirk of Riley's, because he adapts the same attitude when fighting Huey in the episode "Let's Nab Oprah."

<ul><li> Although others had taken advantage of it before (see below), Napoleon Bonaparte popularized the "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_offensive">cult of the offensive<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", emphasising fast, all-in attacks at the enemy's weak-point. (It was actually Georges Danton in the early stages of the French Revolution who formulated the phrase "Il nous faut de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace!" &#151; We must dare, dare again, always dare! &#151; in his speech to the French Assembly in September 1792. This was just after Louis XVI had tried to flee France, and the European powers were gearing up to attack. The French republic was very fragile and a spirit of elan was needed, hence the speech.) The basic logic of this is that the attacker has a significant inherent advantage over the defender, as the attacker dictates where the fighting will take place while the defender has to react to it; and furthermore, while the defender has to spread his forces everywhere necessary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a>, the attacker can concentrate everything on where he intends to break through. In many cases a bold assault (even when out-numbered or out-gunned) can also take the enemy by surprise and shatter their morale.
<ul><li> The greatest use of this was at the Ulm Campaign of 1805, where the French army under Napoleon departed from France in September and marched so blisteringly fast that in only 16 days, they arrived at the <em>rear</em> of the Austrian army in W&uuml;rttemberg before the Austrians were ready to fight. The French captured 60,000 soldiers without a major confrontation.
</li><li> The French Army's one standing order at the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> was "Ataque, ataque, tojours l'ataque!" (Attack, attack, always attack!)
</li><li> The tactic was then used very successfully <em>against</em> the French army by Heinz Guderian and Erwin Rommel during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France">Battle of France (1940)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Rommel's 7th Panzer Division moved several miles ahead of the German Army, leaving its flanks very vulnerable to counter-attack, but the Allies were in such a disorganized state that Rommel was able to rout any counter-attacks just by doing a massive frontal assault with his tanks.
</li><li> On the other hand such bold attacks can also fail <em>spectacularly</em>, as in Guderian and Hoth's first attempt to encircle Smolensk (July 1941, encirclement completed thanks to great sacrifice by Hoth's forces), Guderian's attempt to make a 'deep' encirclement of Kiev around Kursk (August 1941, Guderian's forces successfully retreated over river to conduct &#147;shallow&#148; encirclement instead), or Guderian's attempt to capture Tula (November 1941, Guderian's forces shattered by Soviet counter-attacks).

</li><li> When asked to contribute to Sweden's entrance into the 30 Years War, the Estates of Yeomen famously declared that "Better to stable our horses at the house of our enemies than his in ours." That is, if you have to fight a war, might as well do it far away from home. Swedish tactics of the time were known as <em>g&aring;-p&aring;</em> &#151; literally "go on". The Swedish army in the late 17th/early 18th century relied on this offensive approach and lined up a series of great victories.
<ul><li> It certainly worked well in 1700 at Narva. The Swedes attacked in dense snowstorm with 4000 men against tenfold numbers of Russians in fortified positions &#151; and won the day. Mainly because the Russians simply didn't believe anyone would be insane enough to attack in that weather.
</li><li> Then, in 1709, the army of Tsar Peter arrived near the small town of Poltava which the Swedes were besieging. The Swedes decided to <em>Attack</em>, but to properly engage they needed to sneak past some redoubts in the Russians' extended defense line. The Swedish army didn't know how to sneak, however, and instead <em>Attacked</em> the redoubts. When the commanders finally managed to get (most of) the surviving troops to disengage and line up on the intended battlefield, the odds were very long: 4,000 infantry<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mne1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1mne1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mne1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(There were cavalry as well, but they were still trying to reform.)</span> faced 20,000 Russians. What to do? <em>Attack!</em> The Swedish army knocked itself out against the Russian line, disintegrated, and was annihilated.
</li><li> Likewise, the Swedish fleet was on offensive all the time in the War of Gustavus III 1788-1790. They managed to achieve several Pyrrhic victories and catastrophic losses, but they won decisively in 1790 in the battle of Rochensalm when they were on defensive.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussiansWithRustingRockets">Russian</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedsWithRockets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedsWithRockets">Soviet</a>) operative procedure since Generalissimus Aleksandr Suvorov: <em>Defence exists solely to enable attack</em>. The Russian way of warfare is focused solely on attack. Justified, since most of Russia is plain (steppe and fields) where defensive warfare is pretty much doomed to fail, but has produced appalling losses abroad in terrain which favours the defender and against an enemy skilled in defence. The standard Russian defence strategy is to simply retreat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScorchedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScorchedEarth">trade space to time</a> and prepare for counterattack.
</li><li> There's a saying in kendo: "<em>bogyo no tame no bogyo nashi</em>" ("there's no such thing as defense for defense's sake"). Kendo practitioners are trained to respond to attacks by themselves attacking and trying to get there first, rather than focusing on defense.
<ul><li> The emphasis on attack is nowhere more evident than in Jigen-ryu Kenjutsu, a school of swordsmanship adopted by the Satsuma Clan and used with crushing effectiveness until swords were outlawed in Japan. Practitioners would attack by unleashing a flurry of diagonal blows alternating between left and right. Training (which continues in Kyushu even today) consists of striking a hardwood pole repeatedly with a wooden sword until, over time, it is reduced to an hourglass shape.
</li><li> This is in contrast to conventional Western fencing, where the first principle is "don't get hit." If you manage to stab your opponent but get stabbed at the same time, you've still lost, making the Parry-Riposte a standard tactic. This is based on the idea that if a sword is already heading at you at high speed, it's not going to stop dead just because you stick the guy holding it.
<ul><li> Stop-hits are much more used in epee fencing. This is because epee is based on duels to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstBlood">First Blood</a> and the weapons used were much less likely to be fatal if you got stabbed.
</li><li> In Renaissance-era fencing, at least in its German tradition, offense was promoted on the principle that if you don't attack, you won't beat the other guy, and if you only defend yourself, sooner or later he'll find an opening and do this to you. It is generally easier to strike before the other guy does than to master a high-level counter-technique. By contrast in competing English philosophy, an overzealous opponent can be goaded into conspicuous openings - in doing so you frustrate him, control his offense and lure him into exposing himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Arguably this translates equally well into real-life application, as some martial arts systems (kali or Wing Chun comes to mind) advocate 'attacking the weapon' as a defensive strategy.
</li><li> Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do combat philosophy (by definition not a distinct style) gets its name from the idea that every move has the potential to end the fight, so a block is a re-purposed attack, and parries are matched with a simultaneous counterattack.
</li></ul></li><li> The last order of battle of admiral Horatio Nelson was <em>Engage the enemy more closely</em>. The Royal Navy has always been known for extremely aggressive tactics and doctrines.
<ul><li> The loss of three battlecruisers in the battle of Jutland 1916 was an example of this. The safety of handling the powder cartouches was sacrificed in order to maximize the firing speed, and the flashproof doors were kept open to enable quick delivery of the powder. It is said if the Germans had used a similar doctrine against the Royal Navy that day, the Royal Navy in turn would have lost eight or nine battlecruisers.
</li><li> The very concept of the Royal Navy battlecruiser. Regular battleships were designed to strike a rough balance between speed, armour and firepower; battlecruisers were equally massive but had reduced armour thickness in exchange for slightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">more speed</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">bigger guns</a>. Distinguishing battleships from battlecruisers can be tricky, as there was no formal definition of a battlecruiser, and battleship/battlecruiser naval guns steadily increased in size during the interwar period (so a battleship could use larger guns than an older battlecruiser). However the relevance of the trope is demonstrated by the fact that the thickest sections of a battleship's armour (which protected the most vital areas) were designed to, on paper at least, withstand a hit from the vessel's own main battery. Battlecruiser armour was not.
<ul><li> Royal Navy battlecruisers were never originally <em>meant</em> to engage battleships. As the name kind of implies, they were intended to fight other <em>cruisers</em> in defense of the British Empire, and other cruisers were faster than the battleships of the era (necessitating the higher speed) yet had smaller and thereby shorter-ranged guns (making armor less of a concern). It was when the need for more big guns led to their being put into action against enemy battleships <em>anyway</em> that they started to fall short. (It's also worth noting that the <em>German</em> battlecruisers of WWI were built differently from the start &mdash; carrying slightly smaller guns and having a shorter operational range instead of skimping on protection &mdash; because, to help make up for the Royal Navy's superior numbers, they <em>were</em> intended to stand in the line of battle to begin with.)
</li></ul></li><li> Nelson most notably tried this at the 1797 Battle of St Vincent; commanding the 74-gun HMS Captain, he disobeyed orders to attack the Spanish van consisting of the 80-gun San Nicolas, the 112-gun San Josef, and the 130-gun Santisima Trinidad (the largest warship afloat), supported only by one other British 74-gun ship. After exchanging fire for an hour, Nelson grappled and boarded the San Nicolas; when the San Josef came to her aid, Nelson boarded the San Josef over the decks of the San Nicolas, capturing both ships.
</li><li> In 1801, legendary Royal Navy officer Thomas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">'the Sea Wolf'</a> Cochrane, commanding HMS <em>Speedy</em> (a tiny sloop) encountered the Spanish <em>El Gamo</em> frigate, around four times the size of the <em>Speedy</em> with six times the crew. Cochrane attacked, eventually taking El Gamo by boarding. Believe it or not, this was among the man's saner exploits. He was the inspiration for fictional naval captains such as Horatio Hornblower - generally toned down, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> and no-one would believe them in fiction. Suffice it to say, such was his reputation for this strategy that even in his late seventies, the Navy point blank refused to give him a command during the Crimean War on the grounds that they had no idea what he might do with it.
</li><li> Arguably, the Royal Navy's predilection for the offensive comes from the Admiral Byng affair. Byng was a career admiral in the Royal Navy during the War of Spanish Succession. In 1708, he was ordered to relocate his fleet immediately from the Channel to the Mediterranean, given little money or time to prepare, so he could relieve the siege of Minorca, then a British possession. By the time he arrived, the French had landed 15,000 troops on the island and he was forced to engage the French fleet (which outnumbered him) in an inconclusive battle, after which the French fleet snuck away. Damaged, low on provisions, and without the ability to force the French troops on Minorca to surrender, Byng advised acknowledging Minorca was lost and returned to Gibraltar to repair, reprovision, and meet up with reinforcements, then reopen the fight. All in all, it was a reasonable conclusion. When he arrived in Gibraltar, however, he was immediately arrested and sent back to Britain to face court-martial for "not doing his utmost against the enemy." He was convicted and executed by firing squad on the deck of a former French ship that had been captured and pressed into service by the Royal Navy, essentially serving as an example to other British admirals that, if they refused to fight or pursue even a superior enemy, even if they were running low on provisions and wouldn't have done much for the overall objective, they'd be tried and shot back home. Voltaire later commented on this incident in his Candide, coining the phrase "encourager les autres" after the main character sees a British naval officer being executed in Portsmouth. A British companion remarks: "In this country, it is good to kill an admiral from time to time, to encourage the others." After Byng's execution, British admirals understandably made a name for themselves when it came to determined aggression against opposing fleets.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Japanese officers were taught to try and find a chance for an attack even when being attacked, with the spirit of the offensive carefully cultivated among Japanese soldiers. This world very well against poorly supplied Guomindang militia and most Guomindang-allied warlords - whose troops usually lacked any kind of artillery whatsoever (aside from a few mortars), food (though not always to the point of fainting), ammo, air support, armor and sophisticated communications equipment aside from old radios and the odd heliograph (such that shifting operational and even tactical reserves was often impossible for them). The Guomindang's Central Army troops and the Guangxi Clique's warlord army were better equipped and had plenty of radios, but lacked automatic weapons to counter banzai charges, meaning that it was easy for a small squad of Japanese to overrun Chinese defenses (and either keep the area, or lose it to another Chinese counterattack). In the Pacific, this eventually ended up as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">'Banzai charge'</a> and usually went very badly facing Allied troops - particularly against Americans with their excesses of communications equipment, artillery, air support, vehicles, machine guns, and ammunition for all their weapons.
<ul><li> There was also such a strong cultural imperative among the Japanese to <em>not surrender under any circumstances</em> that they would make such a charge knowing they would all die, precisely <em>because</em> they would all die. This was made all the more evident during the Battle of Okinawa, where the Japanese put up such a fierce resistance against the far superior US military (who clearly had the tide in favor of them ever since the Midway battle) that the losses were so great on both sides; this eventually culminated in the US utilising <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption">nuclear weapons in the anti-city campaign, to destroy two of the handful of cities which it had been impossible to destroy using conventional weapons.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtomicBombingsOfHiroshimaAndNagasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtomicBombingsOfHiroshimaAndNagasaki">By demonstrating their capacity to defeat the Japanese Army with little effort, by using these weapons, they totally invalidated the Japanese Army's claims that the Americans might not have the stomach to invade the Home Islands and take the losses necessary to subjugate it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Let us not forget the bold effort put forth by the men of Taffy 3 during <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar">"The Battle off Samar"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> during World War II. By responding so aggressively to an obviously superior force, a small force of destroyers and aircraft held off the largest battleship ever constructed along with its battle group.
<ul><li> The main reasons this resulted in victory as opposed to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">"taking as many of you with me as possible"</a> are A) Good tactics, maneuvering, and gunnery by the light destroyers and destroyer escorts (known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">"tin cans" due to their lack of armor</a>) as they charged straight into the formationless Japanese battle group, sinking a few heavy cruisers with close range torpedo runs and wrecking the (essentially unarmored) upper works of heavier ships, moving as quickly and erratically as possible to stay alive, B) the hundreds of aircraft (which were completely unequipped to be taking on any kind of ships, and thus instead flew right at/around the Japanese ships, strafing their decks with machine guns...or in some cases, <em>with nothing at all</em>), combined with the several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">light destroyers and destroyer escorts rushing a massive battlegroup and ''winning''</a> and an inaccurate intelligence report that a full American carrier battle group was in the area, led the Japanese officers to believe that they were facing a <em>much</em> larger and more powerful force than they actually were. With the tiny American ships doing massively disproportional damage and charging what should have been suicidal odds without hesitation, hundreds of aircraft attacking from everywhere, strafing their decks and dropping what <em>seemed</em> to be bombs and torpedoes (but were actually depth charges or fuel tanks...), causing the entire battlegroup&mdash;already disorganized by the "general attack" order given at the start of the battle by the Japanese commander&mdash;to be thrown into complete chaos, maneuvering like crazy all over the place, it very much <em>seemed</em> like they like were facing one. To make matters worse, smoke-screens deliberately created by the destroyers/destroyer escorts helped to conceal the fact that there were only four small escort carriers, instead of potentially several fleet carriers. The end result was that the massive, extremely powerful Center Force <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">retreated right as it was on the verge of total victory</a>, with most of the already-few-in-number light destroyers and destroyer escorts sinking or sunk, and no way to resupply and/or re-equip their planes until it was far too late.
<ul><li> The planes were probably the biggest users of this trope. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> puts it, " Aircraft from the carriers of Taffy 1, 2, and 3, including FM-2 Wildcats, F6F Hellcats and TBM Avengers, strafed, bombed, torpedoed, rocketed, depth-charged, fired <em>at least one .38 caliber handgun</em> and made numerous "dry" runs at the attacking force when they ran out of ammunition."
</li><li> Though the whole Attack Attack Attack mentality was best summed up by an unidentified sailor. Having damaged practically every ship in the opposing force, left several sunk or sinking, and outclassing the American force ship-to-ship by a ridiculous margin, the Japanese force nonetheless withdraws against the unexpectedly fierce resistance.

</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirtySixStratagems">The Principle of the Offensive</a> is one of the Nine Principles of War, and every military in the world teaches it to officer candidates. Only by going on the offensive is it possible to seize the initiative. The Japanese didn't have the industrial base or the resources to support large-scale mechanized warfare, and the massive banzai charges occasionally worked well in China (as the Guomindang used warlord and militia troops to take the brunt of Japanese offensives while their Central Army soldiers would attempt strategic encirclements) and even against some European troops. When they dug in and attempted World War I style static defensive tactics, it only resulted in large-scale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> type battles in places like Okinawa and Iwo Jima, because they surrendered the initiative to the Americans, who were then able to act at a time and place of their own choosing. The resulting battles were always very bloody for both sides, but the final outcome was never in the slightest doubt: lose the initiative, lose the fight. And the Japanese, strategically speaking, lost the initiative when they failed to hold Guadalcanal, not even one year after Pearl Harbor.
</li></ul></li><li> Legendary Marine commander <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesty_Puller">Chesty<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.badassoftheweek.com/puller.html">Puller<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> never retreated, he merely advanced in a different direction.

</div><ul><li> To be fair, when he said the above quote, he was completely surrounded by Chinese forces. In that case, movement in <em>any</em> direction really is attacking and advancing.
</li></ul></li><li> Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was famous (to his officers, notorious) about taking the offensive <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel#Rommel_as_military_commander">early and often<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, usually at risk to flanking counter attacks, and to the detriment of his supply chain.
<div class="indent">"In the absence of any orders, go find something and kill it."
</div></li><li> This was the go-to tactic for WWII Pacific Fleet Admiral William "Bull" Halsey. It was so much a reputation for him that the Japanese tried to use this against him multiple times. The entire setup of the Battle of Midway hinged on it. It only worked once at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Halsey's first order after seeing the devastation of Pearl Harbor was "Attack, Attack, Attack."
<ul><li> Unfortunately, that attitude led him to go chasing after a group of Japanese carriers, which turned out to be a diversion that left Taffy 3 to fight Japan's Center Force alone in the Battle of Samar. For Halsey, he was lucky that tiny force's sheer badassery managed to carry the day to make his blunder a mere footnote. However to be fair, there was no way he could have known that those carriers represented an empty threat. Up to this point, ignoring Japanese carriers was <em>never</em> a good idea.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton">George S. Patton<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The guy was famous for maxims like "Nobody ever defended anything successfully, there is only attack and attack and attack some more." He famously treated large scale advances into Italy and Germany as races against other Allied officers to get there first!
<div class="indent">"Some goddamn fool once said that flanks have got to be secure. Since then, sonofabitches all over the globe have been guarding their flanks. I don't agree with that. My flanks are something for the enemy to worry about, not me. Before he finds out where my flanks are, I'll be cutting the bastard's throat."
</div><ul><li> George Patton has the distinguished honor of being one of the most successful Generals in the history of warfare. In the operations he administered in World War II, he captured more land, defeated more enemies, and captured more prisoners of war in a faster time than any non-German, non-Soviet officer in history. As with other successful commanders of mobile armies (Hoepner, Hoth, Vatutin, Pliev, etc.), much of his mobile force's 'success' was due to the relative weakness of the enemy forces, who simply did not have the numbers (especially mobile forces) to forestall or halt his advances. However, like said successful commanders, he too made relatively good use of his forces to overwhelm what defending forces there were, turning what could have been merely average victories into thorough ones.
</li></ul></li><li> The standing orders of outdated British fighter squadrons reputedly became this during World War I. It didn't work and culminated in the "Bloody April" of 1917. However, the Royal Flying Corps still carried out its tasks of providing recon and air cover despite those severe losses.
</li><li> This is why the assassination of SS-Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Reinhard Heydrich succeeded. On May 27, 1942, Heydrich was being driven on the Dresden-Prague road when a gunman ambushed him as the car slowed on a hairpin turn. The assassin's sub-machine gun jammed. Instead of having his driver, you know, drive, Heydrich ordered a complete stop so he could jump out and attack his attackers. The assassins took the opportunity to toss a bomb at the car. The resulting explosion wounded Heydrich. Instead of falling back through the smoke, Heydrich decided it would be totally awesome if he continued his charge, chasing his bicycle-mounted assassins on foot until he passed out from the shock. He slipped into a coma and died days later. Although his decision to chase the assassins was meaningless, as, unknown to him, he had already contracted a mortal infection from horsehair car seat fibers becoming embedded inside him due to the grenade blast.
<ul><li> To say nothing of the dark comedy which attended the pursuit of the Heydrich assassins after the attack. Having cornered them in the cellar of a church, the SS decided they would take the partisans alive, sending a succession of soldiers through the very narrow passage which granted access to the refuge. A good many SS men were Sten-gunned to death in the killzone before the partisans were finally apprehended. And by "apprehended" we mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">committing suicide to avoid capture</a>, hammering home how pointless this all was.
</li></ul></li><li> The former page quote is darkly ironic itself, because it comes from Stephan Makarov, one of Tsarist Russia's most distinguished naval commanders, who was reacting to the equivalent of Russia's Pearl Harbor during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RussoJapaneseWar">Russo-Japanese War</a> and the resulting blockade by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">chasing the numerically and qualitatively superior Japanese outside the protected harbor.</a> Then, during one pursuit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">he was killed when the flagship struck - and was sunk by - a mine the IJN had laid specifically to hole the Russian navy up.</a>
</li><li> In poker the most successful players are the aggressive ones. As a rule of thumb, it is better to bet/raise than to check/call in order to keep your opponent under constant pressure.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FinnsWithFearsomeForests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FinnsWithFearsomeForests">Finnish Army</a> guide for young officers: <em>If you do not know what to do, attack. If you do not know where to attack, outflank the enemy. If you don't know where to outflank, do it from your right side.</em>
</li><li> One tactic to deal with close ambush is just to try and push through your enemy, straight in his face, without even basic outflank maneuver. Since you are currently sitting in what is commonly referred to as a kill-zone, that makes sense.
</li><li> This trope is business as usual for soldier-caste social insects. Soldier ants and termites have no function <em>other</em> than to fight to the death in defense of their colonies, so their simple brains don't actually allow for a "retreat" option: the closest they get to one is to revert to a sentry role once the pheromones of battle have been supplanted by an "all clear" signal and there's nothing left to fight.
</li><li> This was the favorite mode during the "romantic" era of chess, giving us immortal games like...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">The Immortal Game</a>. With the advent of better defense techniques, the style went out of fashion. Still, any chess beginner will go through this phase.
