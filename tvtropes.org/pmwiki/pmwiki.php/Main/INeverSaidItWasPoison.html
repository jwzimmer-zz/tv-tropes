</div></div><p>The usual response to a perp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayingTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayingTooMuch">Saying Too Much</a>. The perp, while maintaining their innocence, reveals information they could not have possibly known if they were innocent, usually the specific details of a murder. It can take the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a>. For full dramatic effect, the interrogator does not immediately point out this discrepancy, but continues the interview, often saving the kicker to the very end, as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndAnotherThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndAnotherThing">And Another Thing...</a> epilogue. Even more dramatically, the interrogator may insist it <em>wasn't</em> poison and then probe the perp's reaction to this lie.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope must be handled carefully; when sloppily done, it's likely to turn what should be a dramatic moment into a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>. The most common mistake is making the piece of information something that the person who makes the "slip" could reasonably have found out without committing the offense. The second most common mistake is making the "slip" an assumption that could reasonably be made even by an innocent person.
</p><p>One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook">The Oldest Tricks in the Book</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">something the police do, in fact, do in real questioning</a>. Real police detectives usually hold back specific details of a crime and/or crime scene when making public statements. This has the dual benefits of possibly identifying a suspect and helping separate valid witnesses from useless leads. Knowing these details may not automatically make someone the guilty party, but it's a big clue that they were at least present for the crime. This is one of the reasons civil rights advocates warn that you should never talk to the police without an attorney present. Even an innocent person can make assumptions about a case, and you'll look guilty if they turn out to be right. For example, you might say, "I don't even own a gun" when you were told the victim was murdered but were never told the victim had been shot. It's even possible for the police to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop">forget</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">"forget"</a>) while testifying that they actually <em>did</em> tell you the victim was shot before the interview/interrogation began. Then you're screwed.

Innocent characters attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheHeat">take the fall for a crime they did not commit</a> will probably guess facts about the crime that may not be true. If the facts are incorrect, they will be most likely be called out on it immediately or in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndAnotherThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndAnotherThing">And Another Thing...</a> manner. If the character is guilty, they could willingly give information only the perpetrator would know. This could be played to induce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>.
</p><p>In science fiction and supernatural stories, if the slipped information reveals the true nature of the story's setting, or helps the good character(s) discover something wrong or suspicious about it, it can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGlitchInTheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGlitchInTheMatrix">A Glitch in the Matrix</a>.

Unfortunately for him, Light is too smart to fall for it, always carefully keeping his comments to common knowledge and believable deductions. However, it backfires for Light <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">since the fact that his answers are so perfect only strengthens L's conclusions</a>. Furthermore, L even states clearly, in a loud voice, that he thinks Light's answers are absolutely flawless, and that he would not expect less from Kira. He mostly seems to do that just to push Light's irritation to the point he would make some mistake.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> has this happen once too. In Episode Six, a couple of detectives are apparently transporting Tenma and Anna Liebert to their police station. (They actually work for Johan Liebert.)

</div></li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, Mistress 9 is posing as Hotaru to talk to Sailor Moon. Eventually, she refers to Sailor Moon by her real name, which tips her off: "Hotaru... how did you know I'm Usagi Tsukino?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SketDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SketDance">Sket Dance</a></em>: In the Switch On arc, Switch accidentally tips himself off as the administrator of an anonymous imageboard site by saying the complete name of one of the victims of its feature Death Fight in a conversation with Bossun, who had talked to him to help him solve the case, but never mentioned the victim's full name. That's how Bossun figures him out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service</a></em> uses this one when they find a corpse of a girl that turns out to be parts of seven different girls professionally embalmed and sewed together. Sasaki and Makino decide to go consult a guy who also studied embalming in America. They find he is running a beauty parlor, and he says he doesn't know anything about the body in the photo the girls show him. He offers them a free session when they get tired of chasing serial killers. Sasaki thanks him for his time and leaves. Makino protests that they didn't find anything out about the killer, and Sasaki answers it was the guy they just talked to, as they never said anything about serial killers, and there was only one body in the photo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoupsGarous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoupsGarous">Loups=Garous</a></em>, Ayumi figures out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kunugi</span> is an enemy when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she asks him what time it is and his response is to pull out his monitor, indicating that he knows she doesn't have her monitor with her</span>.
</li><li> Armin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> makes good use of this. When trying to bluff <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Female Titan</span>, he uses the phrase "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesNickname">that suicidal bastard</a>". Based on the subsequent results, he correctly deduced that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Female Titan is actually one of his classmates</span>, since that name was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the 104th trainee class</span>'s nickname for Eren, and only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">people who know Eren and Armin personally</span> would recognize it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, "Bandit" Keith Howard accuses Jonouchi of using someone else's entry card to qualify for the semi-finals of Pegasus' tournament, in a bid to get Jonouchi disqualified after losing to him. Jonouchi freely admits that he was given his current entry card by Mai Kujaku after losing his original one... but Keith had no reason to know that unless he was trying to sabotage the other competitors' progress through the tournament by stealing their entry cards. Pegasus, who already knows that Keith was cheating during his duel against Jonouichi, has Keith ejected from the tournament instead.

Later, after he's done and is leaving the room, he stops to say, "You know Ray, I'm here talking about you getting the gas chamber, and you never asked me what this is about.

The culprit didn't know she did this and ends up referring the shattered container as a perfume bottle <em>three times</em> before even the police knew what it originally was.

<ul><li> As noted, police actually do rely on this as part of real life interrogation techniques. However, over-reliance on this technique has led to a significant number of false confessions and erroneous arrests. Police will either feed the suspect information he didn't know before and he'll repeat it back, and they'll use that to browbeat a confession out of him, or the suspect will make inferences that make it seem like he knows more about the crime than he really does (it's <em>very</em> easy to assume that the victim was shot in a murder case, for example - and if a suspect says many different things, the police can report only the inferences that were correct, making them sound incriminating out of context). This has caused police in some countries to abandon the technique entirely.

</li><li> This was how WFAA sportscaster Dale Hansen managed to trap three officials at Southern Methodist University into admitting they were still paying players on their football team. Hansen had gotten an envelope from a former SMU player who had alleged that he'd been paid by the program and that the envelope had money in it. Hansen then showed the envelope to the officials, and at first, administrator Henry Lee Parker admitted that he'd sent the envelope, but then immediately backtracked, as did the other two officials. At this point, Hansen knew the allegations were true because he'd never mentioned to Parker what had allegedly been in the envelope. Until then, all he had was the word of the former player (David Stanley). If the officials hadn't sent money, they wouldn't have backtracked from their original admission. This eventually led to SMU's football program being given the NCAA's "Death Penalty", resulting in the cancellation of their next two seasons and severe restrictions on their program like limits on coaching hires which so devastated the previously-successful program it took them over twenty years to play in another postseason bowl.
</li><li> In 1995, the Spanish murderer Seraf&iacute;n Cervilla raped and killed his girlfriend due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">her intention to leave him</a>, then played the afflicted boyfriend on TV to cast suspicion off himself. However, the police had him as their main suspect from the beginning, and he only put himself in more trouble when, at the end of a massive demonstration clamoring for justice, he deposited a bouquet of flowers in the <strong>exact</strong> spot where the woman had been murdered... which wasn't the same place where the body was found, and nobody had told Seraf&iacute;n about.
</li><li> Seen in the police interview with Texas serial killer Steven Hobbs on the episode "Predator" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFirst48" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFirst48">The First 48</a></em>. During interrogation, he asks what he's being arrested for. The detective replies that some prostitutes had accused him of getting rough during tricks (which they had, and how he'd been identified as a suspect in the murders).
<div class="indent"><strong>Hobbs:</strong> I never killed nobody. <br><strong>Detective:</strong> I never said you killed anybody.
</div></li><li> This (along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Hoist by His Own Petard</a>) is how Stephen McDaniel was arrested and eventually convicted of killing a fellow college student, Lauren Giddings. During a local news report about Lauren Giddings being missing, Stephen was interviewed as one of the witnesses who last saw her. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIroLgiCyP8">During the interview<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, he was trying to act shocked and confused about her disappearance, but was saying things that were a little too detailed for someone who didn't know anything. The reporter caught on to this and revealed that a body was found, but she is not sure if it was Giddings. The facial expression from McDaniel gives him away, along with his panicking during the rest of the interview where he gives more details about things he shouldn't know.
