Even as she's running for her life, she continues to write and she only stops when she's devoured by a Titan. It ends up being found a year later by Levi and Hange, and contains information that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">proves vital</a> to the story later on. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It reveals Ymir to be a person significantly connected to the Titans, but also provides the first hints that Titans may have very sinister and <em>human</em> origins...</span>
</li><li> Two are discovered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet">Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first is in an OVA, when the Gargantia fleet stumbles upon a giant derelict fleet that's apparently been abandoned and rusting away for quite some time. Based on the captain's logbook Ridget finds, along with some detective work from Pinion in the engine room, some light bugs crystallized the main engine, rendering it useless, and forcing the survivors to get on smaller ships and sail away. It also gives Ridget some closure as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a> of seven years earlier reveals her friend left Gargantia to go with a guy she met on this particular fleet, and she had been wondering what happened to them since then.
</li><li> A second one occurs in episode 9, when Ledo finds an old recording at the bottom of the ocean, which details humanity on Earth a long time back when it was starting to freeze up. The contents are a shocking revelation to him, and contradicts everything he'd been taught by the Galactic Alliance about their losing battle in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> with the Hideauze aliens.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the Hideauze, which were also present on Earth, were genetically modified humans. The predecessor for the Galactic Alliance, the Continental Union, who believed humans should stay humans, were opposed to the genetic experiments performed by the Evolvers, who wanted to modify humanity so they could survive in space to leave behind an increasingly freezing and hostile Earth, and would later become the Hideauze. In space, both groups went to war with each other over their beliefs, while on Earth humans forgot about the Evolvers, and the Earth Hideauze gradually "evolved" into the "whale-squid" that humans generally stay away from and treat with some respect.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The horror manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mail">Mail</a></em> has a story titled "Portrait"; it starts with a woman picking up and arranging her sister's belongings after she had committed suicide via self-immolation and discovering her diary. The diary describes the last few weeks of her sister's life including finding a rare portrait and her growing obsession with it. It starts of with her trying to discover more about the painting, to learning more about the girl in the painting, to writing in her diary that she thinks there is something creepy going on in her apartment, to thinking that the source of the creepiness is that new painting she is so fond of to realizing that sometimes, the eyes of the sleeping girl would open up, to finally writing over and over again how she wants to die. When reading that last page, the woman who finds her sister's diary realizes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the last few pages handwriting slowly changes from her sister's handwriting to someone else's. When she realizes this, she looks at the portrait and realizes that it's looking straight at her. It turns out that the portrait of the girl still has the girl's spirit trapped inside due to the sympathy she got in life, cheering her to live on despite the fact that the only thing she ever wanted was to die and end her suffering and since then, has been committing suicide through the various owners of the portrait!</span>
</li><li> The Director's Cut of episode 21 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> opens with a security video taken about a month before Second Impact. It starts off in a mundane way, picking up not only chatter from staff but a conversation between Gendo and Keel on the nature of scientists. Then with a crash, the scene cuts to the moment when Adam begins to grow into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">the Giant of Light</a>, and we hear shouting from scientists trying to get the Angel under control. The picture cuts off just as Adam's giant, glowing hands reach into the frame. Similarly, all we see of the activation of Unit 04 is a mushroom cloud rising up from the test site, followed by static.

The final log shows their deaths at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">mind</a> of their enraged creation.

</div></li><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>, most of humanity died out in an apocalyptic event. The "7 seeds" are people who were put into deep sleep far below the surface, and then woken and released far in the future when the Earth has become habitable again. However, it turns out they were not the only humans to survive past the event. The main characters later find one of many vast underground shelters built before the event, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nobody is alive there anymore. They find a desiccated body and a journal kept by one of the entertainers asked to come work in the shelter to raise morale. Most of the inhabitants of the shelters were deceived as to why they were there, but come to accept their new life; at first the outlook is hopeful, and there are other shelters they can communicate with. However, eventually technical problems cause the food supply to fall short, and many of the residents of the shelter are told they are to be sent off to another shelter - in reality they are going to be killed. Supplies dwindle and, in addition, eventually contact is lost with all other shelters, presumably because everyone is dead. The journal's author writes of how he and the people in charge fabricate new communications from the other shelters so that the residents won't lose morale. Finally a virus breaks out and slowly the entire population of the shelter falls ill and dies. As he dies the journal's author manages to trap the virus in a freezer where it cannot infect anyone else. His last act is to paint a X on the freezer door, and then he dies outside it with his journal.</span>

While the Others struck at the slaver Free Cities, Jon crossed back to Westeros and made his way north to find Bran, who told him the war was lost, but that he could yet change things: he would send Jon back in time to change history, but he would have to leave behind his identity... becoming the Ghost of the North.</span>

The first trials lead to gruesome deaths of several cats, as the prototype glue turns out to be acidic.

However, they have to cut the agonized cat open again for further experimenting. Then, the experiment's funding is cut, and both of Preterius' lab assistants quit. Preterius, who is slowly succumbing to his alcoholism, keeps on working independently, and seemingly goes mad at the end when he claims Claudandus to be talking to him. It should be noted that <em>Felidae</em> is a crime story told from the viewpoint of a talking cat. Therefore, Preterius' ravings aren't as nutty after all.

<ul><li> The style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater">28 Days Later</a></em> is meant to evoke this, even though the film itself doesn't fit the category. Aside from shooting on relatively inexpensive DV cameras and using odd angles to mimic a "found footage" look, several scenes were deliberately staged to resemble photographs from the genocide and war in Bosnia.

When searching for the source of the outage, the family stumbles on a UFO and a group of aliens who start terrorizing the family. Besides the typical "shaky cam" effect, suspense is added by the fact that the aliens are never shown in detail, as their very presence somehow causes the camera to pixelize. The aliens also possess some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, allowing them to mind control the family. There are two endings: one involves the family members disappearing one-by-one, with the boy holding the camera finally dropping it when coming face-to-face with one of the aliens; the other has the aliens simply walk into the dining room, the family marches out under mind control, and an alien switches off the camera. The director's original intent was to make it as realistic as possible, ending the video abruptly. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> has resulted in ending credits being added, dispelling the mystery by showing who played the aliens.
</li><li> Some of the footage used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBay">The Bay</a></em> is this, like the videos left by Dr. Abrams, head doctor who must deal with the outbreak at the local hospital, and Jennifer, a young girl who records the progress of her infection via a Skype/YouTube-like web app.

It comprises footage shot by an ill-fated documentary film crew researching the Blair Witch urban legend. The film was marketed as real found footage, causing some confusion amongst more gullible viewers.
</li><li> The infamous exploitation film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalHolocaust">Cannibal Holocaust</a></em> is split into halves, the first being the recovery of an Apocalypse Log, and the second being the log itself.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creep2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creep2014">Creep</a></em> plays with this; the setup is that the filming starts off as a video log to be passed to the unborn child of the terminally-ill subject, but as the movie goes on we learn there's something terribly off about him, the tables turn, and it becomes a chronicle of the cameraman's final days,
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveEncounters">Grave Encounters</a></em> is this. It's supposed to be the footage the titular ghost-hunting show takes when they go into an abandoned mental hospital to film an episode. Obviously all of it was supposed to be fake (as shown by the spokesman of the show paying a custodian to say he saw something creepy), but, of course, the ghosts soon turn out to be real, and very, very nasty. It seems to switch between the in-universe cameras and regular ones, though (probably so the whole film wouldn't be in slightly grainy green-light)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellHouseLLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellHouseLLC">Hell House LLC</a></em> starts as a documentary about a haunted house attraction in upstate New York where fifteen people, including most of the crew, die in an unknown accident. The bulk of the film consists of footage shot by the haunted house crew during setup showing how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">everything went off the rails.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBroadcast">The Last Broadcast</a></em> (1998) is a pseudo-documentary featuring found footage from a disastrous cable-access paranormal program. The film pre-dates the vastly more successful <em>Blair Witch Project</em> by a short time, causing many viewers to mistake it for a rip-off.
</li><li> There is also the 70s b-movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfBoggyCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLegendOfBoggyCreek">The Legend of Boggy Creek</a></em> about bigfoot.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ParanormalActivity">Paranormal Activity</a></em> is presented as footage taken by a man whose girlfriend is being terrorized by a demon. It's made pretty obvious that putting up a camera has only made the demon more active &mdash; and angry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePossessionOfMichaelKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePossessionOfMichaelKing">The Possession of Michael King</a></em> starts as a documentary by Michael to disprove the supernatural, and ends up being a warning left to not meddle with such forces.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/REC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/REC">[REC]</a></em> and its American remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Quarantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Quarantine">Quarantine</a></em> are found footage recorded by a female reporter and her camera man while trapped inside an apartment building with zombies.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Age of Stupid</em> is a 2009 pseudo-documentary that is created as one. The various clips we see are old recordings from our time, viewed by a sole archivist played by the late Pete Postlethwaite, living in an arctic repository in the mid-21st century where damage from climate change has driven humanity to extinction. The man attempts to create a film showing why humanity didn't save itself when it had the chance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">It takes a certain view of climate change</a>.
</li><li> The titular journal in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntarcticJournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntarcticJournal">Antarctic Journal</a></em> clearly wants to be an Apocalyptic Log, but since the guys who find it don't really read much of it, and the pictures are vague, it fails in its attempt.
</li><li> Ultimately averted in the 1975 movie <em>Bug</em>. Parmiter makes an audio log of his study of the hybrid bugs, but they deliberately destroy it, so his findings can never be discovered.

The log also had a short clip of what appears to be his family, which he partially recorded over.

</li><li> A very abbreviated version can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EventHorizon">Event Horizon</a></em>, wherein the salvage crew finds the ship's logs. The first portion shows the ambitious crew getting ready to perform the experimental hyperspace jump, but it cuts out at the moment of entry, to be replaced by horrific images of what happened to the crew after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the trip</a>. The last coherent line recorded on the log is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Libera te tutemet ex inferis", or "Save yourself from hell".</span> The last part is actually a plot point, as the original audio recording was garbled and made it seem as if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> was asking for help ("Liberate me" &mdash; "save me"), when, in fact, he was warning people to stay away</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilDead">Evil Dead</a></em> trilogy uses this trope as the catalyst for its plot, as Professor Knowby, the researcher who first unearthed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeofEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeofEldritchLore">Necronomicon</a>, kept an audio journal chronicling his battle with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">demon-possessed</a> wife Henrietta, and his failed attempt to survive the night. Unfortunately, he'd also recorded the recitation of the demon summoning spell that'd accidentally caused the mess to begin with, meaning that anyone who listens to the whole tape ends up going through the exact same thing.
</li><li> The original 1954 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gojira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gojira">Gojira</a></em> featured a reporter giving a blow-by-blow description of Gojira's destruction of Tokyo, ending with his description of the monster's attack on the tower he was broadcasting from.

He barely escapes from a predatory creature on his first flight, and records his intentions to go back up later and explore more thoroughly. The framing story reveals that the aviator's plane was found crashed and the aviator himself missing. All that was found in the plane was a torn, blood-stained journal. The last words are hastily scrawled: "Forty-three thousand feet. I shall never see earth again. They are beneath me, three of them. God help me; it is a dreadful death to die!"

At first a straightforward record of Loos and his "friend," Jan Pelgrom, attempting to seek shelter with a local tribe, the journal slowly becomes more and more supernatural- especially with the introduction of a mysterious ruby ring that Pelgrom wears. However, the truth of this particular matter is never quite resolved, as the most overt record of anyone displaying magical power is in the final chapter &mdash; by which time, Loos is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">delirious</a> and barely coherent in his last pages.

Hawkeye volunteers to deliver her eulogy since she was his latest girlfriend, but no one in camp, Hawkeye included, knows much about her since she was quite aloof and anti-social. Then Father Mulcahy finds her diary in her personal effects and gives it to Hawkeye for inspiration. While we only get a summary from Hawkeye (mostly how she was so anti-social because she looked up to each and everyone there and was too shy to approach them), we do get to hear her last entry, which weighs pretty heavy on Hawkeye: <em>"I can't sleep tonight.

<div class="indent"><strong>Melia:</strong> In time, a thousand worlds bore the fruit of life in this form. Then one day our people stepped foot on a dark world where a terrible enemy slept. Never before had we encountered beings with powers that rivaled our own. In our overconfidence, we were unprepared and outnumbered. The enemy fed upon defenseless human worlds like a great scourge, until finally only Atlantis remained. This city's great shield was powerful enough to withstand their terrible weapons, but here we were besieged for many years. In an offer to save the last of our kind, we submerged our great city into the ocean. The Atlantis Stargate was the one and only link back to Earth from this galaxy, and those who remained used it to return to that world that was once home. There the last survivors of Atlantis lived out the remainder of their lives. This city was left to slumber, in the hope that our kind would one day return.

<ul><li> Commentator Carl Phillips describes the effects of the Martian heat ray right up to the bitter end:
<div class="indent"><strong>Phillips:</strong> A humped shape is rising out of the pit. I can make out a small beam of light against a mirror. What's that? There's a jet of flame springing from the mirror, and it leaps right at the advancing men. It strikes them head on! Good Lord, they're turning into flame! <em>(screams and unearthly shrieks)</em> <strong>Phillips:</strong> Now the whole field's caught fire. <em>(explosion)</em> The woods... the barns... the gas tanks of automobiles... it's spreading everywhere. It's coming this way. About twenty yards to my right... <em>(crash of microphone, then dead silence)</em>
</div></li><li> An even better example is the announcer broadcasting from atop the CBS building in New York, watching the Martian's poisonous smoke drift across the city.
<div class="indent"><strong>Announcer:</strong> Smoke comes out, black smoke, drifting over the city. People in the streets see it now. They're running towards the East River, thousands of them, dropping in like rats. Now the smoke's spreading faster. It's reached Times Square. People are trying to run away from it, but it's no use. They're &mdash; They're falling like flies. Now the smoke's crossing Sixth Avenue... Fifth Avenue... a hundred yards away... it's &mdash; it's fifty feet.... <em>(a thud, as he collapses)</em>

Even then, Diabolic Victories can get even more disturbing.

</li><li> We never get to read it, but the galaxy-sized locust swarm that is the Tyranid race was named because of the Apocalyptic Log that was left behind, buried 1000 feet underground, on the planet Tyran. Most of the Tyranid Codexes &mdash; combinations of backstory and rulebook &mdash; contain detached descriptions of Tyranid attacks that read like an encyclopedia entry based off an Apocalyptic Log as well.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> background book <em>Liber Chaotica</em> is written as an in-character study of the Chaos Gods. As the book goes on, the author starts having more and more ominous visions and making less and less sense as he descends into madness. At least half of the quotes in the Necron, Tyranid, and Dark Eldar codexes fit this trope.

In 1930, the remains of the three expedition members, their camp and a large number of photos and diary entries were found at Kvit&oslash;ya island. In these, the men had recorded in extraordinary detail how their balloon crashed after just three days on July 14, their increasingly desperate attempts to get back to Svalbard the following three months and their ultimately doomed battle against cold, hunger, disease and exhaustion. Andr&eacute;e ended the last coherent diary entry, from early october, with the words: <em>"With such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">comrades</a> as these, one ought to be able to manage under practically any circumstances whatsoever."</em> All the members of the expedition are believed to have perished just a few days later.

</li><li> The "scientist records his last thoughts, scientifically" variant was purportedly done in the early 1920's by Allan Blair, the scientist credited with proving black widow spider bites are dangerous to humans, took a rather direct route, as recounted in Gordon Grice's "The Red Hourglass." The guy continued writing notes until the pain proved too much; then he had an assistant continue taking notes. Fortunately, though he proved spiders can be dangerous, he did manage to survive the bite.
</li><li> On the night of the 25th of November 1936, a Nebraska proctologist named Edwin Katskee injected himself with a large dose of then-legal cocaine. He was found dead in his office the following morning, having written out his symptoms as he experienced them. As the night went on, the handwriting of his entries became increasingly erratic, with the final entry simply detailing "paralysis", then a swirling scrawl that ends heading to the floor where his corpse was discovered. Nobody is quite sure what the purpose of this was, as his family stated it was an experiment gone wrong, citing an antidote nearby that Katskee had either decided not to use or was unable to do so. Others contend that it was a suicide, and that he decided to detail his symptoms as a means of leaving behind something for his fellow physicians to utilize. If the later theory proved true, it was sadly for naught. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">The physicians who later examined his "death diary" found the entries too erratic and illegible to be of any scientific use.</a>

On seeing the gigantic airship burning, and people falling from the passenger decks, he coined the famous aghast phrase: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhTheHumanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhTheHumanity">Oh, the Humanity!</a>" Despite the shocking power of the explosion, amazingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneShouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneShouldSurviveThat">about two-thirds of the passengers escaped alive.</a> The other one-third died mainly because they panicked and jumped out of the cabin before they hit the ground.

</li><li> The heartbreaking nine-page diary of twelve-year-old Tanya Savicheva, in which she systematically recorded the deaths of her entire family, one death per page, during the Siege of Leningrad. The final entry reads, in a childish scrawl: "The Savichevs are dead. Everyone is dead. Only Tanya is left."

While flying his light aircraft from Melbourne to King Island he reported to ATC that he was being harassed by an unidentified "aircraft" that he presumed was an Air Force jet of some kind, but none were operating in his area, nor were any civil planes in the vicinity. In his final transmission he comes to a frightening realisation:
<div class="indent">"That strange aircraft is hovering on top of me again." (open microphone for two seconds) "It is hovering and..." (open microphone for one second) "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">...it's not an aircraft.</a>" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cjyz');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0cjyz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cjyz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One of the less supernatural, yet no less disturbing theories is that, due to Valentich's lack of experience flying at night and becoming disoriented in a cloud bank, he was flying <em>inverted</em> without realizing it. (You'd think you would <em>know</em> if you were upside down, but thanks to the concept of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_spiral">Graveyard Spiral<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_illusions_in_aviation">various sensory illusions that can occur while flying<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it is actually harder than it seems to determine orientation when flying in the dark...) The "lights" he saw would have been his own, reflecting in the water <em>above</em> him as he descended closer and closer. While considerably more mundane than alien abduction or a prelude to <em>War of the Worlds,</em> it's still disturbing when you consider that if it was like this, the poor guy was rapidly advancing upon his own violent death and likely never even realized what killed him.</span>
</div></li><li> The Jonestown massacre in 1978 had so many victims testimony and evidence from several sources remained:
<ul><li> The last speech that Jim Jones gave to the residents of Jonestown was recorded for posterity. In it, you can hear him direct the older members of the community to help the younger children, and for them to "not worry about the children's crying; [the punch] is just a little bitter. It's not painful." Makes for some <a class="urllink" href="http://www.archive.org/details/ptc1978-11-18.flac16">chilling night time listening.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=35667">The Edith Roller journals.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> A former college professor, she kept a detailed log of her daily life in Jonestown. She never came home.
</li><li> The footage of Congressman Leo Ryan's visit to Jonestown collected by NBC News cameraman Bob Brown, which <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJSv0gDPVLA">abruptly ends<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> just as gunmen from Jonestown open fire on Ryan's delegation on a Guyanese airstrip; both Ryan and Brown were killed.
</li></ul></li><li> Tammy Mathre did this in 1978, keeping a diary in her checkbook. She was a nursing student who'd become depressed and increasingly focused on God and what the Bible says about death and dying. She went camping alone in the Big Horn Mountains. A year later a few fragments of her bones were found. The diary proved she hadn't killed herself; she'd been injured and couldn't leave.
</li><li> The eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington state in 1980 was something that was both seen coming due to the increase in volcanic activity, drawing scientists and journalists, and happened suddenly and explosively, which caught several victims with essentially no chance to escape:
<ul><li> David A. Johnston's last message: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Johnston">"Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> An amateur radio operator named Gerry Martin also radioed to Vancouver to report the eruption. His last recorded words were "Gentlemen, the uh, camper and the car sitting over to the south of me is covered. It's gonna get me, too. I can't get out of here..."
</li><li> A subversion occurred with photographer Reid Blackburn, another victim&mdash; <a class="urllink" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0VZOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OfkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2330,1530433">his camera was recovered after the eruption<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but the heat had ruined the film inside.
</li></ul></li><li> The final transmission from RNLB Solomon Browne, the lifeboat involved in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penlee_lifeboat_disaster">Penlee lifeboat disaster<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as it attempted to rescue the crew of the MV Union Star in hurricane force winds. Both vessels were lost with all hands.
<div class="indent"> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yeIX0VnUMKo#t=2365s">...We've got four off at the moment, male and female.

</div></li><li> In 1988, Ivan Lester McGuire went skydiving and recorded his dive. Partway through the video, he appears to be looking for his ripcord, which he can't find, since he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">forgotten his parachute</a>. At this point the camera goes spinning until the video glitches out, as footage of the final stage of his descent was destroyed on impact.
</li><li> <em>Any</em> detailed, candid diary writing by a person in the grips of depression or similar can read like one of these. Things are going great, then one starts going downhill. For example, the last words Kenneth Williams wrote in his diary before his apparent suicide in 1988 were, "What's the bloody point?"
</li><li> Christopher McCandless kept a diary of his time in the Alaskan wilderness, which documented his eventual death by starvation in Alaska on the 112th day of his excursion, August 1992. Notably, this also appears in literature and film as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWild">Into the Wild</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Bj&ouml;rk</a> once had a stalker by the name of Ricardo Lopez. He had planned to kill her with a letter bomb which would launch a discharge of corrosive acid upon opening, and he kept a video diary detailing the process of his plans. During the course of the diary we can clearly see Lopez' mental health erode, culminating in the final entry in September 1996 with him shaving his head, painting his face, and blowing his brains out with a revolver, on camera.
</li><li> In the days before committing mass suicide in 1997 several members of the Heaven's Gate cult recorded <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-s1oqIIfN4">final<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhYrSF3ubBc">exit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKQ2a7tQLd4">statements.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The morning after the suicide the tapes with the recorded statements were delivered to a surviving member.
</li><li> During the shooting at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> High School a library phone line was left open by a teacher who called 911 before the shooters' entrance forced her to leave the phone to go hide. The open line caught and recorded the sounds of students being killed and injured, the dialogue of the shooters to their victims and each other, and after the shooters leave the surviving students being told to quickly flee out a nearby door then dead air. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HsYMgn9aHs">The first five minutes of the call<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> were released in which by listening carefully under the conversation of the teacher and 911 operator several things can be heard. Including a bomb going off, the shooters cheering and after entering the library shouting at the students get up, and three shots being fired (two of the shots were fatal).
</li><li> There are a number of appropriately awful accounts from the submarine world, notably the brief log kept by the survivors of "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_submarine_Kursk_explosion">Kursk<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> "after her sinking. And, even worse, the audio recording from "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Thresher_%28SSN-593%29">USS Thresher<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>'s" underwater telephone. The captain kept up a narrative as the submarine sank, totally out of control, and passed crush depth. Utterly horrifying.
</li><li> The September 11th attacks provide several examples:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTMF6k3c3q4">Kevin Cosgrove's last phone call<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from an upper floor in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. As he describes the situation, he suddenly shouts, "<em>Oh, <strong>God!</strong></em>" and screams as the building collapses around him.
</li><li> Aboard United Flight 93 was Todd Beamer, who used an on-plane telephone to recount what had happened on board and a plan to take back control of the plane: "Are you guys ready? Let's roll." The "rolling" was for a snack cart that was used as a battering ram on the door to the cockpit; UA 93 was eventually crashed into a field in western Pennsylvania, well away from any major US landmarks.
</li><li> And on AA Flight 11, attendant <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Ong#Phone_call">Betty Ong desperately tried to inform ground operations<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Between difficulty breathing (the hijackers had sprayed mace) and repeated requests for her name and seat number, and then operations specialist Nydia Gonzales getting the same requests when she tried to relay the information, precious seconds were wasted, but it was Ms. Ong's call that led to the grounding of every plane flying through American airspace.
</li></ul></li><li> The onboard video camera was recovered from the wreckage of Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em> after its 2003 disaster and the last few minutes were played, although it stopped before the actual disintegration.
</li><li> Amateur documentary filmmaker and bear enthusiast <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Treadwell">Timothy Treadwell<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> accidentally left a camera recording (audio only) on the 2003 night he and his girlfriend were fatally attacked by a starving Grizzly bear. While the tape has never been released for obvious reasons, according to those who have heard it it's completely terrifying. The documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrizzlyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GrizzlyMan">Grizzly Man</a></em> showed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WernerHerzog">Werner Herzog</a> listening to it and becoming increasingly freaked out in lieu of playing it.
</li><li> After the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004, a tourist victim's camera was recovered with the memory card still readable. Photos of the wave were published, one of them shot just a few seconds before the guy was pulled under.

</div></li><li> The black box of the <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_El_Faro">SS El Faro<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> documents the activities of the bridge crew as she sails into Hurricane Joaquin. It starts out mundane enough, with idle conversations and shooting the bull, before it begins into more sober comments about the deteriorating weather and the ship's attempts to weather the storm. Soon enough, it becomes clear that the ship is foundering and the captain gives the order to abandon ship. The last words on the recording are that of the captain trying to assist a panicked crew member out of the bridge as the ship capsizes. Sadly, no one from the <em>El Faro</em> survived.
</li><li> During the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire in British Columbia, one resident witnessed the destruction of his home via the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTlGFsP4JeQ">living room security camera feed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> streamed to his iPhone.
</li><li> The diary of Linda Bishop, a mentally ill (bipolar) homeless woman who sequestered herself in an abandoned farmhouse and recorded her experience in a notebook. For over three months, she lived on nothing but apples scavenged from a nearby orchard and melted snow. When her apples ran out, she documented the process of her slow starvation&mdash;"35th day w/out food"&mdash;until her death. All the while she was directly across the street from an occupied home, but she never crossed the street to seek help. She may have worried that she'd be removed from her place, as she had broken in and it wasn't actually her house. <em>God Knows Where I Am</em> is a documentary of her story, which was released in 2017.
</li><li> The mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Nov. 5, 2017 was captured on video almost in its entirety, as the church recorded its sermons every week in order to post them on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. The cameramen were among the first to be shot when the gunman broke in, and no one was able to turn it off, so the camera kept rolling as the congregation was massacred. Thankfully, this footage is not available to the public.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEhcD0VomKE">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the abandoned headquarters of the defunct Ames department store chain, accompanied by ghostly PA system voice-overs, concludes with the company's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasTheLastEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasTheLastEntry">final voicemail</a> to employees.
</li><li> Purportedly, the last communication of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostShip">Ghost Ship</a> <em>Ourang Medan</em> in either 1940, 1947, or 1948 (sources conflict) was a Morse Code message of grim portent. It is an Apocalyptic Log rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressCall">Distress Call</a> on account of everyone, including the message sender, being dead by the time the message was received. The only ship able to attempt a rescue reportedly found the crew uninjured but all dead, staring and gaping at the sky. The <em>Ourang Medan</em> soon caught fire, exploded, and sank, sending the vessel, its crew, and its mystery to the bottom of the sea.
<div class="indent"><em>SOS from Ourang Medan *** We float. All officers including the Captain, dead in chartroom and on the bridge. Probably whole of crew dead ***. I die.</em>
</div><ul><li> If real, the running theory is either carbon monoxide or a chemical weapon leak. As the ship's mission was classified and the ship itself having been renamed, but not having been recorded as having done so in several records, the chemical weapon theory is viable. The explosion could then be caused by the gas being flammable and the victim's faces looking up in horror meaning it was at least in part somehow hallucinogenic (or deprived the brain of oxygen, causing hallucinogenic like symptoms) or incredibly painful or both. Some bodies were also reported to still be standing where they died, meaning whatever it was caused muscle stiffening, paralysis, and/or rigor mortis almost immediately.
</li></ul></li><li> During the early jet age, ejection seats would not operate until the cockpit canopy was jettisoned (today they can punch through the glass). A British pilot test-flying a hawker-Siddeley Sea Hawk had his controls jam while in a moderate descent over open ocean. His canopy would not jettison, so he could not egress the doomed plane. He calmly narrated the last moments of his flight and his efforts to recover control so that later pilots might learn from what happened. The transmission was cut off at impact.
</li><li> A hilarious example from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>mamayuuma:</strong> my parents bought me this rly shady bottle of Coke from mexico should i drink it <br><strong>mamayuuma:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">i'm gonna drink it</a> <br><strong>mamayuuma:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">update: apparently it's supposed to be the original recipe it tastes kind of weird</a> <br><strong>mamayuuma:</strong> EVERYTHIG NIS VER Y FUNN Y AND I AM V ERY AW AYKE ALRIGHT <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterioratesIntoGibberish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterioratesIntoGibberish">LA LRHAIGTH LARIGHTAL RIGHT LALTH IRHTALTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</a> <br><strong>spoopyhahanonoseeren:</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">didnt the original recipe have cocaine</a></span>
</div></li><li> While it doesn't work 100%, it's still an interesting type of this. In Aokigahara, a forest in Japan famous for the amount of suicides that have taken place there, photos have been taken of trash and items strewn around where the bodies were found. There are things like shoes, hair brushes, papers, glasses, and much, much more. If you were to look through it, it would probably give you a great deal of information about the person and what was going on in their lives before they ultimately ended themselves.
</li><li> This is sort of the whole reason they have black boxes on airplanes. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) records everything said in the cockpit and over the radio on an aircraft, and the device is made of highly durable material that's unlikely to be destroyed in a crash. (And as for the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShticks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShticks">Stock Shtick</a> about "why don't they just make the whole plane out of that material?"...well, such a plane would be too heavy to fly, and it wouldn't protect passengers from the impact anyway.)
<div class="indent"><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines_Flight_261">ALA 261 First Officer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> - I think if it's controllable, we oughta just try to land it &mdash; <br>ALA 261 Captain - you think so? ok let's head for LA. <br>ALA 261 - [<em>thump</em>] <br>ALA 261 First Officer - you feel that? <br>ALA 261 Captain - yeah. <br>ALA 261 Captain - ok gimme sl&mdash; see, this is a bitch. <br>ALA 261 First Officer - is it? <br>ALA 261 Captain - yeah. <br>ALA 261 - [<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticClicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticClicking">2 clicks, then an extremely loud bang</a></em>] <br>ALA 261 Captain -<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressCall">Mayday</a>!
</div><ul><li> The most common last word on black box recordings is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Shit!</a>" (or its equivalent in the pilot's native language). This is rendered as "Unintelligible" when said recordings are broadcast on the news. Probably the second most common is "OH MY G*... [static noise]"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qw11');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3qw11" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qw11');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Note: Muslim pilots saying "Allah Akbar (God is Great)" before a plane crash is not an indication that the crash was intentional; Muslims believe that these should be their last words if possible. It's no more indicative of ill intent than a Jew saying the "Sh'ma", or a Christian saying the "Our Father" or 23rd Psalm.</span>
</li><li> Occasionally, a pilot who knows he or she is going down and likely about to die will intentionally call out a message to a loved one, intending for it to be picked up by the CVR in hopes that the person it's directed to will eventually hear it. For instance, the pilot of a PSA plane that <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA_Flight_182">crashed in San Diego<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> yelled "Ma, I love you!" just before his plane hit the ground.
</li><li> The <em>other</em> black box serves as one for the aircraft itself. The flight data recorder logs pretty much everything that happens to an airplane, including instrument readings, mechanical data, and control inputs. Flight data recorders are often vital to the task of determining the cause of a crash.
</li></ul></li><li> There are plans by the U.S Department of Energy to leave one of these in nuclear waste storage facilities for future civilizations to uncover. The way they outline what message they want to convey <a class="urllink" href="https://www.damninteresting.com/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor/">sounds more like<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> they're warning whoever comes near not to unleash the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">Shambler locked inside the facility</a>, or something. One of the lines in the message was used for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Epigraph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Epigraph">Epigraph</a> of one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk">Immortal Hulk</a></em>:
<div class="indent">"This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here. What is here is dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger."
</div></li><li> Ted Turner, upon the launching of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN">CNN</a>, vowed that the channel would never sign off, even to the point of becoming one of these. Luckily, it hasn't happened yet.
<div class="indent">"We won't be signing off until the world ends. We'll be on, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event... and when the end of the world comes, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEARQ5Q60UM">we'll play 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' before we sign off<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>."
