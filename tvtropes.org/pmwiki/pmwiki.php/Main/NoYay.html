<ul><li> Kusuko's insane father is a powder box merchant who enslaves low-born young women and sells them to men to be abused.

Not horrifying enough for you? To keep his daughter in line, he tells her scary stories about a monstrous yuurei, Nainai-sama, who haunts their box-maze mansion. Except Nainai-sama is real...
</li><li> Shinonome's obsession with Shiro, given Shiro's implied past of being made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> by him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear">Air Gear</a></em> features a BDSM-type relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Arthur</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">Shalott</a>, including a scene where they lay naked together. Another No Yay scene features Arthur pelvic thrusting against his opponent Agito and nibbling on his ear. Oh, and when Shalott straddles Agito at the end of one chapter and tells him after he tortures him via pulling out his teeth he can "have a lick" if he wants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Airmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Airmaster">Airmaster</a></em>: Kinjiro and Nagato. Nagato is quite unattractive and Kinjiro is attractive. Nagato says he wants to have Kinjiro's babies and asks him for a kiss which he reluctantly gives to take the pain of an injury away.

One notable scene being when he gets on top of her in bed when brushing her teeth which causes her to act like she's having an orgasm the entire time while moaning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Griffith's very possessive obsession with Guts... constantly telling Guts "You are mine"/"You belong to me." Trying to kill him to prevent him from leaving the Band Of The Hawks, visiting Princess Charlotte and having sex with her immediately after Guts left out of frustration and depression, and then, when the Eclipse goes down, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after consigning his entire body of men to be eaten alive by demons and becoming Femto, planting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcefulKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcefulKiss">Forceful Kiss</a> on Guts' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> Casca before <em>brutally raping</em> her into insanity... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">forcing Guts to watch while he is doing so</a></em> and deliberately staring straight into Guts's eyes the ENTIRE TIME he is doing that to Casca</span>.
</li><li> All those rapes or near-rapes in the series that various characters endure.
</li><li> Rosine the "Elf Queen" and Jill, two minor characters in a story arc shortly after the Eclipse, given the age of the two and Rosine's rather disturbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> obsession with Jill.
</li><li> Princess Charlotte and her old father, the King of Midland. She looks identical to her mother, the Queen, which... caused some problems. Canonically, he ends up trying to rape her, after his rage that Griffith slept with her. This alienates her from her father to the point of disowning him and refusing to see him when he's on his deathbed, his health having seriously deteriorated because of the guilt of what he had done.
</li><li> Slan's attraction to Guts. She's probably incapable of feeling love, being evil to the bone and all, so she seems to want to make Guts her personal sex toy. At one point, Slan decides to show up to taunt Guts in the Qliphoth. She decides to do this by appearing in front of him completely naked and acting as though they're having sex. This would be erotic, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">how beautiful and sexy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">Slan</a> is... if it wasn't for the fact that the body she's in is made out of the <em>internal organs of the hundreds of trolls that Guts has just slaughtered</em>, they are surrounded by blood and gore, and she's impaling him with her hair.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a>: Decode</em> a number of comments that Shyamalan makes about Sayaka, and the way he treats her when they're alone together, suggest that he may have feelings for her&mdash;despite the fact that he's an adult corporate executive and she's a high-schooler (and also that he, you know, wants to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use the super weapon Sayaka is playing host to to wipe out most of humanity</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>:
<ul><li> Baron Kelvin's obsession with Ciel. It's particularly disturbing since Baron Kelvin is a fat and old reprobate who <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">fell in love</a></em> with Ciel when the latter was just seven years old.
</li><li> And the strongly implied sex scene between Alois/Jim and his "father" the Earl Trancy in episode 8 of the second season.
<ul><li> Everything about the late Earl Trancy and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">"doll" collection</a>.
</li><li> In episode 9 the Earl Trancy is seen briefly kissing the foot of the much younger Alois and later Ciel.
</li></ul></li><li> Sebastian and Ciel is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> by a lot of the fandom, but it can come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>-tastic threats at times, since Sebastian is basically killing time until he gets to eat Ciel's soul. And actually tries to in both the anime and manga. It's also implied that his influence in Ciel's life is corrupting him further. There's also a disturbing scene in the manga where he <em>breathes in mustard gas</em> without inflicting any harm to himself before returning to have his usual subtext with Ciel.
<ul><li> Chapter 94 features Sebastian grabbing Ciel and tying him up with tendrils of darkness as well as grabbing his face in his hands and getting quite close. This occurring while Ciel was in a bed, still weak from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the poisonous gas</span>, and utterly afraid of Sebastian at the time makes this example especially jarring.
</li></ul></li><li> Grell's crush on Sebastian, given Grell is a psychopath who talks within the same five minutes about wanting to cut Sebastian into pieces and bear his children.
</li><li> Ciel is kind of a pedo magnet. Aleister, Sebastian, Undertaker, Kelvin, Claude, Lau, &amp; Nina. As well as some late-teens; Soma &amp; Redmond.
</li><li> For an 11-year-old girl, Sieglinde is very educated in sex and seems way too eager to lose her virginity (offering herself to Ciel and Sebastian to gain their trust, suggesting she eats food off Ciel's body, asking Sebastian for "DNA", etc.).
</li><li> Maurice Cole and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">behavior</a> towards Edgar, given how it's makeup that makes him look Bishonen and underneath he's not good looking, as well as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">atrocious personality</a>.
</li><li> In episode 20 a deformed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonkish</a> looking guy tears Sebastian's shirt open deliberately, who's shackled to a wall, and fawns over him saying "He's lovely!" He also comments on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes">pretty eyes</a> that he would love to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">destroy</a> and says "Let's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesTheSoundOfScreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesTheSoundOfScreaming">hear a nice scream from you,</a> you pretty thing!" before torturing him.

His passionate dialogue towards Ban includes how he has a "throbbing desire" to kill him, as well as screaming for Ban to "give his body to him," "meet his desires," "quench his thirst and let him enjoy himself."

Coming from a bespectacled little blonde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> in a frilly Victorian gown makes this even more creepy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">M&Auml;R</a></em>, we have Alviss/Phantom. Normally, with the Phantom's attempts to kiss Alviss and his obsession with him and lack of personal space around him you'd think this would just be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOnGuyIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyOnGuyIsHot">Guy-on-Guy Is Hot</a> but <em>not</em> when Phantom brainwashes Alviss into staying by his side forever, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LecherousLicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LecherousLicking">licks the tears from his face</a> and attempts to kill him.

</li><li> Yuri's father and Yuri, as revealed in Episode 15. He <em>carves her body with a chisel</em> to make her "look beautiful" and be worthy of his love, while repeatedly telling her that she's ugly and he can't love ugly things. And this is not counting all of the hints that he sexually abused Yuri as well.

Also, Johan's behavior towards his twin sister Anna is pretty darn creepy. Roberto is also shown having sex with two woman, and a fat ugly prostitute once comments on how well endowed Roberto is.
</li><li> Johan's fixation on the much older Tenma has a messed up mind game feel to it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MotherKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MotherKeeper">Mother Keeper</a></em> has this with Silas towards Zelik. Zelik sells people and Silas is a frequent buyer, but he is shown to make creepy comments about wanting Zelik to sell himself to him to Zelik himself. Zelik tends to brush it off but it's rather unsettling that this is a common comment. Later on when Silas <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnaps and beats Zelik</span> he threatens to have him raped by several men, causing Zelik to panic.

<ul><li> There is much suspicion among fans that Orochimaru <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">wants Sasuke's body</a> for reasons more... personal than simply having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowingOffTheNewBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowingOffTheNewBody">powerful new vessel</a>. The Chapter 345 manga cover that featured a smiling Orochimaru literally wrapping his tongue and arms around Sasuke with the caption to the side reading "Within these arms. At the end of this tongue. The future that I raised", or <a class="urllink" href="http://i24.tinypic.com/34pfhv6.jpg">the anime intro with a nude Sasuke wrapped in Orochimaru's pet snakes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> with Orochimaru's eyes watching the image, make it so much worse.
</li><li> Orochimaru's apparent fondness for randomly caressing the faces of little kids (such as Kimimaro), or trying to wrap his ridiculously long phallic-looking tongue around people's bodies, or referring to Naruto and Sasuke as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">cute and beautiful</a>", or thinking "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Your body will be mine soon, Sasuke-kun</a>." Then there's his final fight with Sasuke, in which Orochimaru sweats and struggles against being pinned against the wall before reverting to his true form, a giant snake comprised of a bunch of tinier snakes, and trying to wrap his snakes and curl himself around/smother a half-naked Sasuke while screaming "Give me your body, Sasuke-kun!"
</li><li> In Episode 53 of the original anime, Jiraiya briefly pervs on Naruto. (Japanese) "You! You're quite sexy when you're naked." (English) "You know... you have quite a tight sexy little body."
</li><li> Kabuto/Orochimaru is nowhere near wholesome. It gets worse&mdash;Kabuto has absorbed Orochimaru's remains so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Orochimaru is literally inside of Kabuto</a>.
</li><li> Kabuto/Naruto. Kabuto has a peculiar creepy fixation on Naruto and (in the anime) has called him "cute."
</li><li> Hidan/Shikamaru. Just watch Hidan's reactions when he got Shikamaru alone in the woods. It almost felt like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> was about to go down. And Hidan looked to be almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGruntingOrgasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGruntingOrgasm">orgasming</a> after stabbing Shikamaru.
</li><li> Naruto and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain">Filler Villain</a> Fuka. She makes quite a few suggestive comments to him and tries to kiss him while ignoring his personal space but we mustn't forget that she's actually just a living head of hair and that when she tries to kiss Naruto she's literally trying to suck his soul/chakra out.
</li><li> Kabuto/Sasuke. In Chapter 581 he attempted to get Sasuke to join him and said he'll be like a big brother to him and never leave his side after just attempting to eat him nonetheless with a wide snake like mouth. Lord, No Yay.
</li><li> The non-canon movie <em>Road to Ninja</em> shows a parallel universe version of Neji who has no qualms checking out his younger cousin in the baths.

The movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Toneri Otsutsuki, is a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> towards Hinata, to the point where he tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">kill Naruto because he knows they're in love with each other</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">force Hinata into marrying him</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot">use her to repopulate the Earth</a> after he crashes the moon into it. This is on top of him also kidnapping Hinata's little sister Hanabi and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">ripping both of her eyes out</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It gets even worse</a>&mdash;when Toneri realizes that Hinata accepting his marriage proposal was a ruse so that she could destroy his Tenseigan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnotizeThePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnotizeThePrincess">he hypnotizes her into being one of his mindless puppets</a>. To top it all off, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10889002/1/Ashita">this fanfic writer pointed out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the wedding dress Toneri forces Hinata to wear is far too elaborate for a single person to put on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">hinting that Toneri had Hinata stripped naked by his puppets and likely did other things to her when he was alone with her</a>, considering he has no problems whatsoever trying to forcibly kiss her at their wedding ceremony when she's in her brainwashed state and, therefore, is unable to consent.

The only "safe" choices would be shipping secondary/tertiary characters with each other, only because they look normal in comparison.
<ul><li> The series does everything it can to imply that there is something going on between Gendo and Rei (a man in his 40s and a 14-year-old girl, respectively), not the least of which is Rei being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his dead wife, from whom she was partially cloned, and the fact that late in the series it's revealed that Gendo and Yui considered naming a potential daughter Rei, upping the incestuous subtext</span>. As with everything from the series, <em>End of Evangelion</em> ramps this up by having Rei spend almost all her time around Gendo <em>completely naked</em>.
</li><li> Misato and Shinji are basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flipped</a> Gendo and Rei. Made worse by the fact that in the movie she actually <em>kisses him</em> in an attempt to snap him out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It does not help.</a>
</li><li> Asuka and Shinji can fall into this at times, especially due to that scene in the movie, in which he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">masturbates over her comatose body</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinjiIkariRaisingProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinjiIkariRaisingProject">Shinji Ikari Raising Project</a></em>, Gendo simply loves Shinji so dearly he wants to bear-hug him from behind or take a bath with him. Even without factoring in their relationship in the main series this is disturbing.
</li><li> The director's cut of the anime also contains a scene where Asuka, a 14-year-old girl, throws herself at Kaji, who's twice her age, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">out of desperation for attention</a>, but he rebuffs her advances since even though he as a reputation as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a> she's <em>way</em> too young for him. To make it worse it's implied that he served as a surrogate father figure for her after her mother's death.

</li><li> A top No. 6 official makes unwanted advances on Dogkeeper in one scene because he thinks she's a prostitute. He also hits on Nezumi.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein">Noein</a></em> pretty much <em>is</em> this trope toward Haruka. When he finally reveals his true form to her, he variously drapes his arms around her shoulders and touches her face, and at one point he asks her to "become one" with him to further his plan. He's naked too, except for the white covering he normally wears but has mostly removed by this point. What makes this all the worse is that Noein is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one version of Haruka's love, Yuu, from the future, who had gone mad with grief after losing her in a car crash</span>&mdash;but in present circumstances he's still much older than her, and evil, and she's twelve.

The way it's portrayed in the movie version is no better: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akio drugged Anthy's drink and then took advantage of her sexually, later stabbing her out of panic after it turned out she was <em>never actually asleep</em> before falling out a window to his death.</span>
</li><li> The movie's no slouch when it comes to this trope, as it also shows that Touga <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was raped by his adoptive father as a child</span>. Ugh.
</li><li> And the sex scene between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akio and Utena</span> in episode 33, given that she's only in eighth grade and he's way older than her, plus the dubious consent and... unsexy topic of discussion. You won't be thinking of sandwiches the same way again for a good while afterwards.
</li><li> Just about <em>all</em> of Akio's sexual relationships are this trope. Besides the aforementioned incest with Anthy and sex scene with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Utena</span>, he has two further counts of statutory rape with Kozue (13) and Touga (17), plus he's sleeping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IBangedYourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IBangedYourMom">his fianc&eacute;e's mother</a>. Perhaps his <em>least</em> offensive relationship is with Tokiko, and even that's not saying much because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the whole point of him seducing her was to spite Professor Nemuro and ultimately drive him to arson</span>.
</li><li> Kozue and Anthy's car scene in episode 26 is kind of creepy, since out of nowhere Kozue appears to start seducing a blank-faced Anthy in the car - in the middle of Miki's duel.
</li><li> Kozue and Miki's entire relationship. They're twins, Kozue has tried to kiss Miki when he was asleep and when he's awake and has an unhealthy obsession with him. This leads to a scene in the movie when they're in the bath together and she <em>holds a razor to his throat</em> when he refused to tell her something about his personal affairs.
</li><li> In one episode, Miki's piano teacher is hinted to have a less than savoury interest in him, and he's inappropriately touchy-feely with him when they talk. Kozue has clearly noticed, as it later turns out that she'd previously <em>shoved the teacher down the stairs</em> for it.
</li><li> Nanami's obsession with her older brother Touga. She's a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> for him and she once killed a kitten that she had gotten for him for his birthday because he paid more attention to it than her. He also suddenly tries to rape her in Akio's car at one point, which she fights off in horror, and he gets angry because if sex isn't what she wanted, then what <em>does</em> she want? She's also shown watching him when he's taking a shower and Touga jokingly asks her if she wants a kiss and to join him in the shower.

He almost instantly took an interest in Akagi when he first saw him, cheered him on during the Kainan game, and his rivalry with him is his main motivation for improving. Even after quitting basketball he still travels all the way to Hiroshima just to see Akagi play and even gives him advice in the middle of a game. On Akagi's side he considers Uozumi the better player (despite what everyone else says) and has a great deal of respect for him. Their relationship is even mocked at times, such as when they hug and cry on each other's shoulder, only to show that they're both far too ugly for this to be anything but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>.

Later on, he pretends to have changed his ways in order to become close to Kaneki again and begins working for him, while biding his time until the day he can feast.

It started from when they were mentioned to have met and "hit if off" in a bar, and in the anime when Yamori punches a whole in his side, he seems to consider it flirting, even stating they should save the rest till they get home while holding his hand. He also has commented on how good-looking he found Kaneki and Ayato.
</li><li> Yamori and Kaneki with Yamori torturing Kaneki by continually snapping off his fingers and toes (they regenerate), getting physically close to him, and putting a centipede in his ear. He tells Kaneki that ever since he saw him he wanted to bring him to his torture room. He later screams that he'll eat Kaneki and make a bloody mess out of him. Kaneki eats him instead.
</li><li> Torso and Mutsuki, in the sequel. Torso is a deviant that kidnaps scarred women, keeping their decapitated and dismembered bodies as his "lovers".

Weeks later, Torso violently beats Mutsuki for not smiling at him, screaming that his prisoner has no choice but to love him.

After breaking Kanae down by taunting her over her obsession with her cousin, Eto subjects her to lengthy torture with needles and thread.

He shoves her into her apartment and she tells him to not put his hands on her again. He responds that he'll do more than put his hands on her. It is revealed that she had sexual relationship with him at one time, and she broke it off, because that was her way to establish control over him.

He then implies that the reason S.Q. is so forgetful is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mr. Curtain is brainwashing him</span> (which would <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">remove memories of Mr. Curtain's cruelty</span> and reduce S.Q. inhibitions). We eventually get a less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick-y</a> explanation, but the implications of a (probably non-con) relationship between the villain and his teenage follower are still disturbing. Plus, the explanation came from <em>Reynie</em>, not any of the adult characters, so it might not even be correct.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Outlander">Outlander</a></em> series, there's Captain John Randall towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Jamie</a>.

And <em>then</em>, Randall shows that these impulses actually extend to being out-and-out sexual, revealing his desire for Jamie to "become his"... which eventually results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> poor Jamie getting imprisoned, raped, and beaten (as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence">certain scenario</a> that Randall is into) repeatedly</span>.

The first book alone has <em>bucket loads</em> of No Yay subtext, what with Count Olaf planning on marrying her and later <em>consummating his relationship</em> with his <strong>14-year-old adopted daughter</strong>. While Olaf didn't seem to have anything sexual in mind primarily, he decides that he'll let her live even after he has the fortune and makes quite a few comments on how pretty she is. In the next book he has a knife to her THIGH under the table. There's the line "Violet imagined sleeping beside Count Olaf, and waking up each morning to look at this terrible man.", which shows the author must have known what that would imply to his older readers. And when the hook-handed man has Violet cornered in the tower during the rescue attempt for Sunny, he says into his walkie-talkie "Yes, boss. Yes, boss, of course I understand she's <em>yours</em>, boss." The emphasis is the author's.

At one point, Xander finds her straddling him on a school desk, making out deeply enough that it's clear that if Xander had been much later, it almost certainly would have escalated to sex.

It's interesting because Emma/Regina is a very popular ship (Emma is certainly Regina's most common partner in the fandom, but not necessarily the other way around), but at the same time it is reviled among the rest of the fandom, even parts of the fandom that have nothing to do with either character,

</li><li> Speaking of which, Regina/Leopold is universally despised.

Or, more controversially, you can marry any of the second generation characters. They may be around the same age, sure, but they're actually the children of the rest of the cast. A Male Avatar can even marry Chrom's daughter Lucina. He finds out about her <em>after he witnessed her birth</em>.

Until they actually <em>show</em> his face, and it's revealed he's a 40-50-year-old man. It gets much creepier when the player realizes he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her <em>uncle</em>, and shares the same DNA as her father</span>. And he acts like a <em>complete</em> creep towards Fiona &mdash; abducting her and stripping her so she has to go around the mansion <em>naked</em>, carving a statue of her pregnant (and telling her that he's going to <em>make her that way</em>), sticking some stick thing up her... apparently to make sure she's healthy enough to have his child and to make sure she was a virgin, out-and-out stalking her with a gun ("Fiona, why do you run? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Let me into your womb!</a>"), and if he catches and kills her during gameplay, the Game Over has him <em>raping her body</em>. The worst ending in the game is where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>does</em> manage to kidnap her, and confines her in a cage and apparently impregnates her. She's later shown as his wife, with him being <em>very</em> happy</span>.
</li><li> Lorenzo and Fiona. The guy is a crazy, decrepit, wheel chair bound, incredibly old man. Apparently, he wants to rape and impregnate her, too. It's so disturbing when he's revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her freaking <em>grandfather</em></span>. He creeps the hell out of most people with the way he crawls around grabbing onto Fiona's legs, calling her his "dear Fiona."

He does this because he tries to force them to marry him, and the way he justifies himself and his actions channels every abuser/stalker/rapist trope in the book. <em>Then</em> he transfers all of that obsession towards Finn and Jake (a 13-year-old boy and a dog, respectively), trying to get <em>them</em> to love him by doing things like using a paralyzing potion on them and forcing them to do stuff with him. It can be interpreted as him wanting a friend, but then there's that fanfiction he wrote in which a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flipped</a> Finn declares her undying love for the Ice King.
<ul><li> He does get better in later seasons though. He stops kidnapping princesses and the rapey/abusive aspects of his personality are downplayed. Now he's mostly just a weird, lonely old man.
</li></ul></li><li> In the aforementioned fanfiction, the Ice Queen is just as creepy towards Fionna (if not moreso), <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">impersonating her crush and taking her on a date</span>.
</li><li> Thanks to the crown messing up his memory, Ice King is ignorant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">father-daughter relationship</a> he and Marceline used to share. He once offers to hug her after she confesses she cares for him... and promptly attempts to kiss her. She shoves him away and yells disgustedly "Ugh, not like that!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers</a></em> episode "Ariel" implied that Niko had a slight crush on her captain, Zachary Foxx, at one point. This is pretty reasonable. Zach's got a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a> factors working in his favor. However the (likely) unintentional resemblance she has to Eliza (Zach's wife) makes it a little creepy. That Maya Danzinger voiced Eliza in her only "live" appearance while Laura Dean (Niko's actress) voiced Eliza in "Space Sorcerer" and "Psychocrypt" (both times, turning out to be someone's attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> Zach)... well, this makes it a <em>lot</em> creepy.

From exactly <em>what</em> harm from the pirates does he claim he will protect her? He teases her while putting her necklace back, but it's actually an engagement necklace, so putting it on while immobilizing the girl would be a forced marriage. It's strongly implied/pretty much confirmed in one of the North Pole episodes that even Katara didn't realize that her necklace was an engagement necklace, so it's pretty unlikely that Zuko (who isn't from <em>either</em> Water Tribe) knew. That they were both unaware that he was taunting her with an engagement necklace may or may not make the scene even creepier.
</li><li> Azula has some seriously creepy subtext towards almost everyone, especially towards her brother Zuko, who most of the time she tries to kill. The scene where he questions her about one of her latest schemes in the middle of the night has her acting as close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a> as a PG show could get with an adult woman talking to an unrelated man, so it's quite frankly a miracle that this fourteen-year-old's interactions with her sixteen-year-old brother made it past the censors.

Vlad's first appearance alone has him creeping into Danny's room just watching the boy struggle in his sleep, and the multiple attempts Vlad has tried to lure Danny into the dark side, when taken in a different context, sounds almost seductive. And of course "Eye for an Eye" which is a treasure trove of subtext quotes ("I'm rubbing your nose in this mess you made, Daniel, doesn't it smell yummy?" and "You forgot to take your supplements, have a dose of vitamin-ME!" for example) and has them seeing each other naked. Then there's the prepubescent female clone of Danny that Vlad made... whom he only planned to use to perfect a male clone. Given Vlad's obsession with Danny's mother and desire to make Danny his son, Freud would definitely have something Oedipal related to say about it.

Fans who have seen this claim that the necklace Eska gave Bolin looks like a BDSM collar. There have also been thoughts about what their first night together would have been like, some of them including Desna watching the couple have sex.

<ul><li> There was an episode, back in Season 4, when Wendy and Cartman, who are usually enemies, pair up for a debate and subsequently fall so hard in this that Wendy dreams about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Cartman</a> riding into a mountain meadow, <em>shirtless</em>, on a white horse.
</li><li> Cartman and "Mr. Jefferson". Stan even has a dream about them almost making out!
</li><li> Cartman and Scott Tenorman, especially in "201" when Scott begins grabbing Cartman... and getting awfully close to his face... This quickly goes into squick territory when it's discovered that Eric and Scott are half-brothers.
<ul><li> Cartman's unhealthy obsession with hating on and making Kyle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">suffer</a>. Considering he only saved Kyle solely to rip on him further and another time just for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">suck his balls</a>, his rivalry with him is more than creepy...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> and Squidward given his creepy obsession with him. Don't see it? Come on! <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlAW58yURDc">They're like brothers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">only closer</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>, the very first time Ahsoka met Cad Bane, he electrocuted her <em>twice</em> &mdash; first to knock her out, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">just for the fun of it</a> &mdash; handcuffed her, caressed her head in a rather creepy manner, before taking her Padawan Braid as a trophy. Much later, when Ahsoka protected an unconscious Anakin from him, he left, promising her a dance at an other time. Then there's Garnac, the leader of a Trandoshan hunting party, who hunted Ahsoka and other kidnapped Jedi children on a jungle moon. He provided lines like these:
<div class="indent"><strong>Garnac</strong> She (Ahsoka) can't hide for ever! Mark my words, I'll have her skin, and nail it to the wall <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for killing my son!</span> <br><strong>Garnac</strong> A valiant effort little younglings. Esspecially You, togruta. You'll be a prized trophy of my collection.

Keep in mind that one of them is a slimy brain monster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> Slade embodies this trope on multiple occasions. The ridiculous amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a> with Robin, his not at all wholesome partnership with Terra, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">highly suggestive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> of Raven and suggestive lines/actions towards her in "Birthmark"... the man causes a lot of this. Made even worse because Slade/Terra is a <em>canon pairing</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">the comic</a>. (Though Terra is far, far, far more evil there.)
</li><li> Trigon, Raven's demonic father, and Raven.
</li><li> Fang, a guy with a spider for a head has Kitten as a girlfriend and they once are shown <em>kissing</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> There are those who choose to see Prowl and Lockdown of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> in a slashy light. Why is this disturbing? Because one of them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganTheft">Lock</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepySouvenir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepySouvenir">down</a>. There is no good way for someone else to wear your body parts.
</li><li> The way Cedric from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> acts around Elyon makes him seem like a predator trying to groom her. His constantly low pitched and slithering tone of voice are certainly at least a little unsettling. It doesn't help that Cedric is a grown man while Elyon is a middle schooler.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedIntimacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedIntimacy">Interrupted Intimacy</a> between Dr. Venture and Dr. Quymn is No Yay, <em>if</em> you interpret the episode as subtly hinting that they are half-siblings. In-universe, Dr. Venture has his own reasons for being squicked out in hindsight:
<div class="indent"><strong>Dean:</strong> Dr. Quymn is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuspect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuspect">wereodile</a>! <br><strong>Dr. Venture:</strong> She's...
