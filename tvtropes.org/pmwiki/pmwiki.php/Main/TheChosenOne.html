<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Considering his prophetic dream at the beginning of the anime, and its puzzling counterpart in the manga with the Mysterious Girl, and also adding to the memories of Grisha Yeager and Eren Kruger that he later inherited (keep in mind, this all happened before Eren gained the Attack Titan), it's heavily implied that Eren was <em>always</em> meant to inherit the Attack Titan.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As the military junta poises him as the flag-carrier for their cause, his followers and the public in general at Paradis see Eren as a messiah of sorts, who will lead them in glorious victory against their enemies. Of course, the junta loses control of Eren completely, as it's implied that Eren both drank the Kool-Aid and is being led by the nose by his brother Zeke's agenda</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em>Hitoribotchi no Uchuu Sensou</em> (literally "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">One-Man Cosmic War</a>"), a short sci-fi manga by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FujikoFujio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FujikoFujio">Fujiko F.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">Pok&eacute;mon 2000</a></em>: Ash is the chosen one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThatDudeInTheSuede" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThatDudeInTheSuede">for really realsies</a>. It became a meme for him to be the chosen one of <em>everything.</em> Though he was initially adverse to the idea himself.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ash</strong>: Right now I wish my mom had named me "Bob" instead of Ash. <br><strong>Ash (during a trek across a frozen Tundra)</strong>: Right now, I feel more like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">frozen one</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, the creation of the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> is initially presented as an accident, but even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">LEGO Genetics</a> in place, the whole thing seems too convenient. Near the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> reveals that they were lying and had actually gone and tracked down five girls that were perfect matches for the DNA they had lying around.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em> where it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the hero is NOT the chosen flame-wielder, and the villain IS</span>.

Subverted in that what you (and they themselves) think they're chosen for and what they're <em>actually</em> chosen for are in no way close. They were informed that they have to save Cephiro, but mislead on who they're saving it <em>from</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: A title variously ascribed to Minato, Nagato and Naruto. Since Nagato and Minato both died without doing anything nearly as Chosen One-y as Naruto, it's a safe bet that Naruto's the real one.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Obito Uchiha</a> in a manner of speaking could be this, probably more so than Naruto as his actions are largely responsible for the plot and all opportunities Naruto has to show he is the chosen one are derived from them</span>

</li><li> Though it doesn't fit perfectly, Nasu says that in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a></em>, only one person can be born with the potential to possess "Eyes of Death Perception". This is notable because it implies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Ryougi Shiki</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tohno Shiki</a> exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">separate universes.</a>
</li><li> Griffith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is a good example of a villainous Chosen One, what with being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chosen by the Crimson Behelit to become the fifth member of the Godhand during the Eclipse</span>.
<ul><li> Goes even further than that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's the chosen king of Midland.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, where Shinji is one of the handful of people who can defend humanity by piloting the titular Evangelion biological mecha. Subverted and deconstructed thoroughly, like all other things on the show. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The biological mech he is forced to pilot by his dad has his mother's soul in it. Same situation with Asuka. They were chosen because their mothers would accept no substitutes, and his father had plans with his mother's soul. Then again, said mother also had plans for Shinji...</span>
</li><li> Subverted and then played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao">Demon King Daimao</a></em> right on the 1st episode where the protagonist is calculated to be this generation's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">demon king</span>. Six chapters later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hiroshi is also shown to be sorted as the next Hero, and this is confirmed by taking on the legendary weapon.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>: Yugi (the little one) is referred to as a Chosen One, though in this case, a more appropriate description might be chosen <em>vessel</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharingABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharingABody">his body</a> provides the spirit within the Millennium Puzzle with a physical connection to reality allowing <em>him</em> to save the world. Though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yugi turns out to be the one who will defeat the pharaoh in battle allowing him to move on to the afterlife.</span> Yugi tends to have more messianic associations to his name than Yami Yugi.
<ul><li> Atem is referred to as 'the chosen Pharaoh' in the Millennium World arc, and reference is made to him being part of some prophecy that is never exactly defined, except that he would be able to summon the Gods.
</li></ul></li><li> In its various continuities, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> has two distinct categories of humans partnered with Digimon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">the second and most well-known</a> falling under this trope. The Chosen Children (dubbed as "DigiDestined") are chosen by some higher power for the purpose of partnering with a Digimon to save the Digital World. The term is explicitly used in reference to the protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">its sequel</a> (who are picked by the members of Gennai's order), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> (where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Ophanimon</a> is the one who chose them). Unlike most examples of the trope, there are multiple Chosen Children, to the point where the <em>Adventure</em> continuity had an arc where the main characters assisted Chosen around the world and concluded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenMany">everyone in the world</a> becoming one.
<ul><li> In <em>Digimon Frontier</em>, they were actually chosen <em>twice</em>. Ophanimon sent a text message to thousands of people in the human world, and only those pure of heart responded to her message. Out of those hundreds of children, she didn't know who was fit to possess the Spirits until they crossed the border into the Digital World, and even after that, they had to find the Spirits and prove themselves courageous enough to be worthy of them before they could use them.

</li><li> Slight subversion with the Prophecy of Light: while Garion technically is the main Chosen One, the prophecy makes use of several others for various reasons.

So far, Prince Rhaegar, Rhaegar's children, Stannis Baratheon, and Queen Daenerys have all declared themselves or been declared by others to fit the prophecy. Fans also name Bran and Jon as possible candidates based on everything from their actions to possible parentage.
<ul><li> In a subversion of the trope, Daenerys and Khal Drogo's son is prophesied to be 'the stallion who mounts the world', who will unite the Dothraki tribes and lead them to domination over the eastern continent. However, instead the child is killed in childbirth by <strike> an evil witch</strike> a woman who wanted revenge on Drogo for the destruction of her village and the prophecy is thwarted.
</li><li> One could argue the prophecy was meant for Drogon.
</li><li> There are two possible Chosen Ones. There is more frequently mentioned "The Prince that Was Promised" and Azor Ahai. These may be different names for the same savior, or it may be that they are each the Chosen One for a different task.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character Buffy Summers &mdash; at least until the end of season one where it becomes subverted when Buffy was drowned and quickly resuscitated. She is replaced by Kendra Young, then Faith Lehane, but for all intents and purposes, Buffy is still the Slayer. All Slayers before Buffy (Nikki Wood, the First Slayer, etc) play this trope straight. They rarely live to see their 20s, and tend to be <em>chosen</em> when they're extremely young, at 15-17 if they're exceptionally lucky, and do not get discovered by the Watcher's Council particularly quickly (as appears to be the case with both Buffy and Faith and many of the Potential Slayers during season 7, but not the case with Kendra, who gets an even shorter end of the stick: she is abandoned by her parents and raised by her Watcher). The "One" part of the Chosen One is very literal - "One girl in all the world." (At least until the end of Season One)
<ul><li> It is indicated towards the end of the series that the replacement slayers are already lined up to take over when their predecessor dies, in significant numbers too. Apparently some get activated a little too early, maybe the Prophecy is incapable of distinguishing when a Slayer is going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end of the series, the Good Guys do some magic to speed along the "Choosing" of the potential Slayers, essentially creating an army of girls with their Slayer activated.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> has hinted that despite activating all the potential Slayers, the "line of the Slayers" still runs through Faith Lehane and <em>only</em> through Faith Lehane, as she is the one-and-only Chosen One. He further has hinted that while the mass activation of the Slayers turned every potential alive at that point in time into a Slayer, no further Slayers will be activated until and unless Faith dies, at which point the Slayer line will continue with a Potential born <em>after</em> the mass activation.
</li></ul></li><li> The Anointed One was also an intended chosen one, but happened to be in the form of a child. He got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">killed</a> by a bigger and older vampire who ran out of patience.
</li><li> Funnily enough, despite being the one to stand alone against the forces of darkness, there are plenty of characters out there who make the Slayer look pathetic in comparison. Doesn't even have to be a villain, considering Willow is obviously so much more powerful than Buffy in the end. More often than not, Buffy has to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">her team's help</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">some quick thinking</a> to defeat any given villain.

<ul><li> This is implied to be why Buffy has such a long lifespan compared to other Slayers-although individually quite powerful, Slayers who fight alone tend to die more quickly. Buffy's friends and their diverse skills often give the a Chosen One a much needed edge in the war of darkness.

JM Straczynski practically deserves to be listed under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> trope for his contingency planning. From the very beginning, <em>every single major character</em>, in <em>all five seasons</em> had an "out" written into the story so that they could be removed without affecting the storyline, and indeed, could be reintroduced later if necessary.
</li><li> And he specifically stated in interviews that it was intentional to remove Sinclair (a popular character on B5) during the height of the series. Straczynski designed the show to have a beginning, a middle, and an end (plus 20,000 contingency plans) unlike most shows. But Sinclair leaving at the end of the first season (rather than sometime in Season 2 or 3) and coming back in later seasons was not a contingency plan - it was forced by actor Michael O'Hare's mental health issues (he had schizophrenia; his paranoid delusions weren't helped by the fact that his character was having less-paranoid delusions, as well). This led to JMS bullshitting for several years about how he had "realized Sinclair's arc had played out too quickly" and the character needed to be written out for story reasons; in reality, he had promised O'Hare to keep the circumstances of his departure from the show a secret until O'Hare died (JMS revealed it in May 2013, O'Hare having passed the previous September).
</li></ul></li><li> The trope is also subverted in "Comes the Inquisitor." During this episode, the Inquisitor (on behalf of the Vorlons) tortures Delenn and Sheridan until they both proclaim that they're nothing special, that if they're killed others will just take their places, and that they most likely will die pointlessly and without glory.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> is swimming with them.
<ul><li> Dr. Gaius Baltar is 'chosen' by the hallucinatory vision of the Cylon Number Six (which vision is usually called "Head-Six") to serve the One True God, and she manipulates him to that end over the course of the entire run of the series, from scientist to political leader to champion of the downtrodden underclass to religious icon. She actually calls him 'the chosen one' on several occasions. Interestingly, no matter what happens, the things Baltar must do as the chosen one also get him laid&mdash;and even more interestingly, "Head-Six" is eventually shown to be an actual angel of God (although she doesn't especially care to be called an angel, and God isn't particularly enamored of that title, either), <em>and</em> it turns out that this whole time the physical Six model Baltar had had an affair with on Caprica has a "Head-Baltar" who is also an angel. We're not entirely sure what this reminds us of, but it seems like something.
</li><li> In the second instance, President Laura Roslin comes to believe that she is the dying leader who will lead the people to Earth, based on her interpretation of ancient religious texts. Her role is questioned when she is cured of her supposedly terminal cancer, and reassessed when she suffers a relapse.
</li><li> The third possibility is Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace, who is told early on by the Cylon Leoben that she is important and has a destiny. Unlike the other two, she actively denies it and works against it, before embracing it shortly before her 'death' in the atmosphere of a gas giant. Upon her return, she comes to passionately believe she is now the one destined to lead the human race to Earth, unaware of a Cylon prophecy that she will actually lead the human race to the apocalypse.
</li><li> The fourth example (is that a record?) is the Cylon Number Three (D'Anna Biers), who becomes obsessed with seeing the faces of the Final Five and what lies between life and death. She declares herself to be a chosen one who will lead the Cylons into a new age, but instead her hubris kills her and leads to her entire line being boxed. It turns out her experiences were actually more important to furthering Baltar and arguably Starbuck's positions as 'chosen ones' (by putting Baltar in a position where he found his way back to the fleet, and by enabling Starbuck to find Earth).
</li><li> Really, when it comes right down to it, <em>Battlestar Galactica: Reimagined</em> doesn't really have a Chosen One - it has a Chosen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a>, each with a specific purpose in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"God's"</span> plan.

<ul><li> He's also <em>a</em> Seeker. There were others before him, whenever situation was grave enough to warrant one. Each one is implied to have had his own Confessor and a wizard (at least the one before did). Unfortunately, the one before ended up sleeping with his Confessor and going mad after the wizard convinced her to commit suicide. The wizard ended up killing the Seeker with the Sword of Truth and putting an enchantment on his body to keep his spirit out of the underworld. He then hid the truth (claiming that both the Seeker and the Confessor died in the final battle against the enemy) in order to keep the people's faith in the Seeker.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>, Emma Swan, the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharming">Prince Charming</a> is prophesied to one day save all of the fairy tale characters trapped by the Evil Queen's curse which has them living out mundane lives in our world with no memory of who they really are, and no chance to reclaim their happy endings on their own. Played with in that the only one in-universe who actually believes this is Henry, Emma's son (at least, on the surface).
<ul><li> Oddly enough for the idea, is that Emma fulfills her destiny at the end of season 1, but still has a ton of work to do protecting the town now. Justified by Season 6, which reveals that breaking the curse was just part of Emma's destiny. She's also fated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">face down</a> with the curse's original creator, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Black</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Fairy</a>.

</li><li> In the third season it's implied that Henry is also a chosen one, although given his pedigree it shouldn't come as a surprise. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fulfilled at the end of Season 4, when he becomes the new Author.</span>

<ul><li> Actually, it's Arthur who's the Chosen One. He's just such a Chosen One that fate gave him his own Chosen One to keep him alive and sane throughout being a Chosen One. His wife Guinevere is a Chosen One too, with a destiny so sure that the most powerful healing artifact in the Five Kingdoms could not stop a dream of her becoming queen, because fate had decreed it. In other words, he's such a powerful Chosen One that all the people in his life become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen Ones</a> just by being around him.

First there's Cassandra's prophecy (not the mythological Cassandra) about a "Highland child born on the winter solstice, who has seen both darkness and light and who will defeat the voice of death" and then there's the whole Ahriman/immortal champion thing.

(A third, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alvis</span>, shows up early into Makna Forest, although why they can use the Monado isn't explained until very late-game: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">namely, he <strong>is</strong> the Monado</span>.) Shulk in particular gains the nickname "True Heir to the Monado" for his ability to wield it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The trope is played particularly straight in his case: the reason he can use the Bionis' Monado is because the omnicidal god Zanza <em>arbitrarily chose to inhabit him</em> to further his ends.

<ul><li> The series' in general has the in-universe, metaphysical concept of "heroes". These are rare individuals not bound in any way by fate and who have the ability to rule their own destiny. Heroes are closely related to the prophecies revealed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Elder Scrolls</a>, but are not bound by them, and they often grow to become far more powerful than most other mortals (sometimes to the point of becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> or outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">Deities Of Human Origin</a>). Each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> in the series to date has been such a hero, and many others are mentioned in the series' lore (often as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDeadBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDeadBadass">Long Dead Badasses</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Founders Of Their Kingdoms</a>).

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Nerevarine</a> plays with the trope heavily straight (at face value, at least). According to prophecy, the Nerevarine is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDeadBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDeadBadass">ancient Dunmer hero</a>, Lord Indoril Nerevar. Throughout the main quest, you uncover the lost details of the prophecy and fulfill them yourself until you are recognized by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> Azura, Nerevar's patron. You are granted the Moon-And-Star ring, specially blessed by Azura to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayWield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheChosenMayWield">kill anyone who tries to wear it except for Nerevar</a>, which you are able to wear. You complete the trials of the prophecy, defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> Dagoth Ur, and sever his (and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">Tribunal</a>'s) divine connection to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Heart of Lorkhan</a>. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">there is strong evidence that the player is ''not'' Lord Nerevar reborn</a>, but merely a convenient pawn Azura is using in her revenge plot against the Tribunal (Nerevar's councilors who went against her wishes thousands of years ago, used the Heart, and stole her worshipers along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">possibly murdering Nerevar</a> himself.) It is revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoiceChosen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoiceChosen">there have been others</a> who fit the prophecy, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoorlyChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoorlyChosenOne">were killed before they could fulfill it entirely</a>, and that Azura is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne">The Chooser of The One</a> rather than there being one true Chosen One. <em>Morrowind</em> is probably one of the only stories to combine this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne">The Unchosen One</a> &mdash; at the end of the main quest you get asked if you are Nerevar reborn. It is entirely possible to answer that no, you aren't, but you're doing this because it's the right thing to do (it is given more weight if you <em>didn't</em> fulfill the entire prophetic list of things you are supposed to do before confronting Dagoth Ur yet still is in a position to confront him by your possession of Kagrenac's Tools attuned to you). Finally, there is also the perspective that having the spirit of Nerevar will <em>become</em> more literal as you follow in his footsteps (<em>Elder Scrolls</em> metaphysics allow for avatarizing yourself by '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">walking like he does until he walks like you do</a>', an action known as "Mantling".)
</li><li> They take their Chosen Ones seriously on Vvardenfell, really. One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Tribunal Temple</a>'s standing orders is to execute anyone calling themselves Nerevarine - not because they want to stop the prophesy but rather because if the Nerevarine is going to fulfill every point on his prophetic agenda (yes, there's an actual <em>list</em>) he can't let a little thing like a full inquisitorial execution stop him. Ergo, try to execute every pretender - if they succeed, they know it was an imposter.

Kasel is its current wielder, who wonders if he's up to the task. Just like some of the other examples on this page, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">the series isn't afraid of exploring the ramifications of the concept</a>.
</li><li> The player character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Crystal</a></em> is one to the legendary Pok&eacute;mon Suicune. When the player encounters it at the bottom of the Burnt Tower, Raikou and Entei immediately flee. Suicune bolts as well, but pauses for a moment in front of the player as if it was looking at them before also taking off. A few NPCs state that Suicune will allow a human to draw close to it if said human has a good natured soul. At the Tin Tower later on in the story, you encounter the three legendary Pok&eacute;mon again. Entei and Raikou flee once more, but Suicune attacks the player as if it's testing them. Only the player is allowed to battle and possibly capture Suicune.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em>, each island has a Kahuna that acts as the island's guardian. A Kahuna is picked by the island's guardian deity Pok&eacute;mon and once someone is chosen, they cannot refuse it. Kahunas are also very strong Pok&eacute;mon trainers.

At least, if we're talking about a Player Character who makes it through the game.

The Player Character is also very likely to be the Chosen One bearing the Ring of the High Kings awaited by the Eternal Guardian, though you can just kill him if you want to do things the hard way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em>: When Aloy was born, she was found deep inside the most sacred part of Nora land&mdash;right underneath the claw of the Metal Devil that their Goddess fought. The Matriarchs couldn't agree on whether she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">the daughter of All-Mother sent to save the Nora</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist">the spawn of the Metal Devil sent to awaken it</a>, with Teersa believing the former and Lansra adamantly believing the latter. They were able to reach a compromise in making her an outcast, keeping her away from Nora society for their protection, in Lansra's mind, but keeping open the possibility for her to earn her place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out, she actually was born to save them and the rest of humanity (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">without the religious implications</a>). She is a genetic clone of Elisabet Sobek, the creator of the AI GAIA tasked with terraforming the planet. GAIA knew that she would have full administrative access to nearly all Old Ones technology, which would allow her to restore GAIA, who had to destroy herself to stop HADES.</span> She notably has some typical angst about this on learning the truth but Sylens, as always mocks her:

</li><li> Adol from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a></em> series is a rare combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne">The Unchosen One</a>. In most cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> becomes badass because they were chosen. Adol, by contrast, didn't even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">Jump At The Call</a> &mdash; he set out looking for calls. In the OVA of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a> I</em>, it turns out he has the same name as the prophesized hero, but this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> when the seer's superior reminds her that Adol Christin is a common name and the last one that came to town was a little girl. It turns out that the prophecy is in fact talking about him, but instead of him becoming a hero because he was chosen by the prophecy, it just correctly predicted that he'd show up and save the place. Adol's reputation begins preceeding him <em>as early as the first game</em>. It's generally because of who he is and what he's done that he's given any powers or ancient artifacts that he doesn't get himself &mdash; if you need a hero to save your land, it's only sensible to choose someone with job experience. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsVITheArkOfNapishtim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YsVITheArkOfNapishtim">Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim</a></em>, the daughter of Alma running the trials is not impressed with this random man who just showed up out of nowhere, but after he begins passing them, she asks around about who this 'Adol Christin' guy thinks he is. She grows <em>much</em> more impressed and respectful after that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfTheWizard">Legacy of the Wizard</a></em>: Played with. Roas, the descendant of the wizard who defeated the evil King dragon Keela, is completely useless until the very end of the game, when he suddenly becomes the only one able to wield the Dragon Slayer sword and kill Keela.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld">Erfworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a general sense, specific units can have specific Fates (such as being Fated to serve under a specific Caster or croak a specific Ruler). Some units have a lot more Fate than others. Fighting a specific Fate causes undue hardship as Fate tries to railroad things back onto course. Fate <em>can</em> be beaten, but it is exceedingly difficult and usually just ends up delaying the inevitable. Even if you seemingly defeat Fate (such as, say, by croaking the unit that was supposed to croak you), it will usually just be replaced with a different Fate that is even worse for you.
</li><li> Wanda Firebaugh, has had at least three Fates over the course of her life: Being popped into a doomed Side when everyone else except the Predictamancer was expecting a warlord, serving under the Hippiemancer Olive Branch, and obtaining an Arkentool. After that, she still has Fate, but it's a bit more blurred; she's supposed to be doing <em>something</em> with the Arkenpliers, and she has an unfathomably strong Fated connection to Jillian. Beyond that, it is hard to say.
</li><li> Jillian Zamussels (originally Jillian Banhammer) was originally popped as heir when her father was informed that his perfect bubble kingdom of Faq would fall one day. Jillian was Fated to croak the Ruler of Haffaton (which ended up being Olive Branch, after the original Ruler left Erfworld) and rule Faq as a queen. From there, she has unclear Fates connecting her to Wanda and Ansom.
</li><li> And then of course there is Parson Gotti, summoned from our world to be the "Perfect Warlord." After the Battle of Gobwin Knob, Wanda becomes convinced that he is an even more important instrument of Fate than herself, and refuses to make even basic strategic decisions without him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out she's right. The spell that summoned him was created by multiple conspiracies. The Hippiemancers summoned him to end war, the Thinkamancers to defeat Charlie, and the Predictamancers at the behest of Fate itself</span>.

She also delineates several recurring variants of this trope:
<ul><li> <strong>The Prophesied Chosen One</strong>, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Anakin Skywalker</a>, who is fated by some otherworldly and usually unspecified power to do something specific. This sort of destiny is often literally unavoidable, although it may often resolve itself with some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphecyTwist">Prophecy Twist</a>, and attempts by either heroes or villains to derail it will likely backfire and cause the prophecy to come true anyway. Issues with free will and the having your life inescapably mapped out for you may also crop up.
</li><li> <strong>The Literally Chosen One</strong>, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">Po</a>, who is actively chosen by another person to fulfill a specific role. This case may come with issues stemming from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChooserOfTheOne">The Chooser of The One</a> being, as a person, potentially fallible &mdash; so what if they chose <em>wrong?</em> This may be exacerbated if previously chosen Ones ended up as washouts, failures or outright villains.
</li><li> <strong>The Chosen Wielder</strong> is instead chosen by some sort of powerful artifact, which will in some way select them as its wielder. This comes with the bonus of a handy super-tool that will almost certainly be perfectly suited to dealing with whatever it's chosen you to do, although the definitionally amoral nature of an object means that it's entirely possible for it to choose a villain as its wielder.
</li><li> <strong>The Chosen Incarnation</strong>, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Aang</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda">Link</a>, is a reincarnation of some past hero, and may have been born multiple times over history. They may either be reborn only when some crisis arises that they have to deal with or be reborn at regular intervals, in which case they may have some specific role to play in the world even in times of peace.
</li><li> <strong>The One True King</strong>, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">Simba</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Aragorn</a>, is exactly that &mdash; the rightful ruler of some specific place. Exactly what this means varies from work to work, and can range from cases where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">Rightful King Returns</a> to reclaim the throne from usurpers to ones where the Rightful King is a foreign conqueror with a divine mandate to take over rule of the land. It can also overlap with the Chosen Wielder in cases where the king is chosen by a magic sword a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>.

The first series has Aang, and the second Korra. It sometimes just takes a while to find out who it is. The only exception is the very first one, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne">chose his own destiny</a>, which started the so far ten millennia long reincarnation cycle
</li><li> According to Iroh, Zuko was also a Chosen One, as he was the only Firebender who could teach Firebending to the Avatar, and restore the Fire Nation's honor, by taking on the role of the new Fire Lord.
</li><li> The antagonist Amon also claims to have been chosen by the spirits to cleanse the world of Bending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's lying.</span>
</li><li> The series, of course, also deconstructs this to a certain extent. Aang is a kid when he learns he's the Avatar, and promptly runs away from the pressure. Korra knew she was the Avatar from a young age, even younger than her predecessor was, and it's her <em>only</em> source of self-worth as her series starts. When she gets mercury poisoned in late season 3, it destroys her mentally. All of her friends/family try to tell her that she needs to focus on getting better and they&#146;ll take care of the world in the interim but that just makes things worse because her self-worth is so tied up in being the Avatar. She gets over it with time.

When she was born, the Matriarchs couldn't agree on whether she was the daughter of All-Mother sent to save the Nora, or the spawn of the Metal Devil sent to awaken it, with Teersa believing the former and Lansra adamantly believing the latter. They were able to reach a compromise in making her an outcast, keeping her away from Nora society for their protection, in Lansra's mind, but keeping open the possibility for her to earn her place.
