</div></div><p>The easiest character to write is one who comes premade.
</p><p>For various reasons, an author writes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">themselves</a> or their friends into the story, as themselves. Maybe it's an in-joke. Maybe it's a message. Maybe they're just seizing the nearest source of inspiration.
</p><p>Although this is more common in fiction than some authors would dare admit, it really broke out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Webcomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Webcomics">Webcomics</a> due to their less formal standards. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> was probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> (although see below). A popular variation is to name the character after the person's online handle instead.

</p><p>This has occasionally been known to create embarrassing situations when the character's inspiration recognizes themselves but objects to the way they're portrayed in the story.

This also creates opportunities for people to try <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">armchair psychoanalysis of the author</a>, rather than critiquing the story on its own merits.

<ul><li> Manga-ka Rohan Kishibe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> fame uses his Stand, Heaven's Door, when he needs inspiration for new characters to add to his manga, <em>Pink Dark Boy.</em> Heaven's Door is capable of reading minds literally like a book, which makes it easy for Rohan to get new "material" so to speak. Unfortunately for Koichi and Hazamada, though, he isn't too bothered about whether or not his participant is willing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a>,</em> Harima becomes a mangaka and inserts thinly-veiled counterparts of himself, Tenma, and other characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou">The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</a></em>, while Mashiro's manga art is impeccable, her storytelling is below par due to her inability to understand emotions. Her editor Ayano recommended she describe the daily happenings in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyHousehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyHousehold">Sakura Hall</a>. Eventually, her serialized manga <em>Nanohana-sou</em> is practically what happened in the Sakura Hall at the moment, except that she and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder">Cloudcuckoolander's Minder</a> Sorata switched <em>bodies</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SketDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SketDance">Sket Dance</a></em>: The Sket Dan club found itself in a situation where they had to perform a "Snow White" play for the children, but all their costumes and props have been sabotaged. Only the little puppets which were supposed to represent the seven dwarfs have been spared. What shall they do? Shall they cancel the show? No! They decide to improvise a puppet play based on a true story (which happened to them in an earlier episode), masking it as a typical Japanese demon tale.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionsOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionsOfLove">Missions Of Love</a></em>, Yukina bases her phone novel characters off herself and her two love interests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ICantUnderstandWhatMyHusbandIsSaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ICantUnderstandWhatMyHusbandIsSaying">I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Kaoru and Hajime first met, they were in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with another woman who worked with them. The third party took the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a> route and later decided to submit the story to a publisher (after showing the rough draft to Kaoru).
</li><li> Hajime's brother Youta also tried to use the story of Hajime and Kaoru's first date in his manga, but he ultimately decided against doing so.
</li><li> In general, Youta's yaoi doujinshi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherAttraction">are based on fantasies that he's had of Hajime</a>.

</li><li> Several in-universe examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em>, a series that pokes fun at how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic">shoujo manga</a> is made:
<ul><li> Nozaki has a fair amount of imaginative flair, but he tends to draw inspiration from the people and situations that surround him. For example, Mamiko has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Mikoshiba's personality</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Sakura's freshman ribbon look</span>, a minor male character with a horribly oblivious and brash personality is based on Seo and a minor female character who hates him but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo">loves his alter ego</a> is based on Wakamatsu.
</li><li> Played with in chapter 20/episode 6 where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickEpisode">Nozaki is sick</a> and Hori, Sakura, and Wakamatsu have to make up the story themselves.
<ul><li> When Hori asks Sakura and Wakamatsu to think of a girl they know as a model for Mamiko, they both think of Seo... who being the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">Lad-ette</a> is anything but shoujo heroine material, which is evident when they think of dialogue based on what she would say and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodDissonance">said dialogue doesn't at all match the scenes</a>. Hori flat-out remarks, "You guys have no decent women around you, do you?"
</li><li> Then when Hori has to think of someone to match Suzuki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">good-looking popular guy</a> traits, he thinks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Kashima</a> and insists on using a sparkly screentone for all his scenes because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingParent">"if it were Kashima, she would shine in every scene"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> On a meta level, Nozaki is an example of author Izumi Tsubaki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCareerSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCareerSelfDeprecation">Creator Career Self-Deprecation</a> and his career reflects her own in certain aspects, such as a self-acknowledged problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Only Six Faces</a> and a mangaka career that began in high school.
</li></ul></li><li> In one chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>, Fafnir writes a doujinshi whose main characters are based on Lucoa and Shouta (though they look absolutely nothing like them in the finished product due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist">his abysmal drawing skills</a>).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> spin-off "We Want to Talk About Kaguya", Karen specifically asks Ishigami to tell her if he ever falls in love so she can write a manga about it. This is her idea of repaying him for acting as the editor of her KaguyaXShirogane doujinshi.

An unexpected consequence of living near a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Weirdness Magnet</a> inside a Weirdness Nexus was that he actually <em>took</em> their personality traits away as he wrote about them until the original person was left empty and depressed to the point of suicide.

Most of them haven't even been renamed. In the early books, Meister R&ouml;hrich had the name of his real-life counterpart, but he sued against it, so the name was changed to R&ouml;hrich.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, it has been established that the teen humour comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PatsyWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PatsyWalker">Patsy Walker</a></em> was written by Patsy's mother, using her teenage daughter and her friends as inspiration for the characters.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> episode "Write Where It Hurts" follows Daria's attempts to put people she knows in a fictional story with moral dimensions.

<ul><li> In "I Am Furious Yellow", Bart bases his comic book-turned-web series character Angry Dad on Homer Simpson.
</li><li> In another episode, "Diatribe of a Mad Housewife", Marge writes a romance novel in which the boorish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a> resembles Homer and the desirable Fabio-alike resembles Ned Flanders. At one point she accidentally wrote in Homer's and Ned's names instead of the characters' though no one (especially not the people studying the book who point this fact out) really picks up on the reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DogCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DogCity">Dog City</a></em> had Ace Hart based on his creator, Elliot Shag, and the supporting cast based on those in Elliot's life.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em>, Doug bases his comic book Quailman on himself, Quaildog on Porkchop, various villains on Roger or Mr. Bones, and includes his friends in other roles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> has an interesting example. Funky Kong writes a movie script that is clearly based on the lives of the characters. However, when Bluster Kong becomes director, he casts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">King K. Rool</a> as the hero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Donkey Kong</a> as the villain.

<ul><li> The seven characters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/Freakies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/Freakies">Freakies</a> cereal were based on people that Jackie End, creator of the Freakies, knew from the Wells Rich Greene ad agency:
<ul><li> BossMoss, the egocentric leader, was based on Charlie Moss, the president of Wells Rich Greene. End mentions that this was a risk, but she still had her job, so it worked out in the end.
</li><li> Snorkledorf, the narcissistic character, was based on Stan Dragoti, co-creative director of Wells Rich Greene.
</li><li> Gargle, the smart know-it-all, was based on a British writer from Wells Rich Greene.
</li><li> Goody-Goody, the kiss-up that liked to get others in trouble, was based on Grace Feldman, head of personnel at Wells Rich Greene. End admits she based Feldman on her in a pang of bitterness over not getting something for her office.
</li><li> Grumble, the grumpy old man, was based on a former older worker of the office.
</li><li> Hamhose, the shy and nervous character, is the only Freakie not to be based on someone from the office. Instead, his personality comes from Pigpen, a cat End used to own.
</li><li> Finally, Cowmumble, the sweet and demure member, is based on Jackie End herself, or rather, herself four years prior to the creation of Freakies.
</li><li> An eighth Freakie that never came to fruition, the aristocratic Nifty Nifty, was set to be based on Mary Wells Lawrence, the Wells Rich Greene founding president and chairman.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> anime is notorious for having the author of the manga, Koshi Rikudo, appear at the beginning of every episode as himself giving permission for his manga to be turned into something completely different. Furthermore, Nabeshin is an anime-only character and is a self-insert of the series director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShinichiWatanabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShinichiWatanabe">Shinichi Watanabe</a>, who also parodies this trope to the extreme and even has Nabeshin and Rikudo doing battle in a metaphor for the artistic battles that take place when a work is adapted from manga to anime.
</li><li> For that matter, Nabeshin or variations thereof also appear in most of Watanabe's works. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuniPuniPoemi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuniPuniPoemi">Puni Puni Poemi</a></em> has the same Nabeshin as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP">Tenchi Muyo!

Furthermore, the Nabeshin likeness has appeared as a guest-star in several anime that Watanabe is <em>not</em> involved with. In one interview, Watanabe said that he'd like to get rid of the hairdo, but he's become so closely associated with the character, that he's afraid of what the fan reaction would be if he did.
</li><li> Harima Kenji from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolRumble">School Rumble</a></em> is practically based on the mangaka, both in design and story.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em>, Victoream gets a magical melon which summons a god to grant him one wish. And who is god? Manga author Makoto Raiku, of course, who denies Victoream's wish for another melon on the grounds that he already ate it himself.

Sounds slightly familiar...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> has stated that Usagi's (a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a>) family is based on her own. Usagi and Minako are based on herself, with the former's hairstyle based on a good luck ritual of her own. Rei's miko backstory and attitude towards men came from getting hit on during her own employment at a Shinto shrine.
</li><li> Bits of the cast's quirks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> come from friends of Mashima's. Supposedly, Gray's stripping came from Mashima himself. In addition, Joy Fullbun, Chico=c=Hammit, and Wang Chamji appearances are based on his assistants.
</li><li> Many of the '60s and '70s scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys">20th Century Boys</a></em> are based on incidents from author Naoki Urasawa's childhood, though he denies that the main protagonist Kenji is actually based on him. He's claimed in an interview that he sees himself as more like Otcho.
</li><li> The personality of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Tsukimi</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessJellyfish">Princess Jellyfish</a></em> is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/kuragehime/v01/c006/32.html">lifted wholesale<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from Akiko Higashimura's younger self.
</li><li> Yattaran, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a>'s first mate, is based on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaoruShintani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaoruShintani">Kaoru Shintani</a>, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em> and good friend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto">Leiji Matsumoto</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>'s Light Yagami isn't exactly top of the list of characters you'd pick for this, but if you dig a little deeper some startling coincidences arise. Author Tsugumi Ohba's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the character he most resembles is Light, "because I did well at school". He also says that he chose the kanji "moon" to represent Light's unusual name because he wanted the meaning to be "moonlight". This all falls into focus when you find out that Ohba's given name Tsugumi, usually rendered in phonetic hiragana, translates in kanji as "beautiful moonlight" (&#32654;&#26376;&#20809;)! It's a penname, of course, but still an amusing backstory.
</li><li> Kentarou Miura of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> fame partly based the characters in the Band of the Hawk on his friends in college, and feels like he has a bit of both Guts and Griffith inside himself.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> appeared as himself in his final issue on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AnimalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AnimalMan">Animal Man</a></em>. Unusually for this trope, he tells Animal Man that he is writing the character's adventures, and proceeds to bring the character's murdered family <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, thinking it might be nice to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">give a character a happy ending for once</a>. (Of course, in the very next issue of <em>Animal Man</em>, the protagonist forgot all about this encounter.) Shortly afterwards a <em>very</em> similar character known only as The Writer appeared in John Ostrander's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em> &mdash; he was torn to shreds by a wolfman after getting a case of writer's block.
</li><li> John Ostrander has been known for this himself. A number of people have had characters named for them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starslayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starslayer">Starslayer</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrimJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrimJack">Grim Jack</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em>... including one troper's mother.

Unlike with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>, Dave Sim <em>wanted</em> his creation to remember their encounter and made sure that would happen in a particularly cruel way. Sim also appeared in person in a later story arc.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em> story "The Hydra and the Lion", Hellboy encounters a young girl pulling the Hydra's teeth with pliers. She claims to be half-lion and roars at him to prove it (waking the Hydra up). In the prologue to the story in the collection <em>The Troll-Witch and Other Stories</em>, Mike Mignola writes that the girl is heavily based on his daughter Kate, down to claiming to be half-lion.
</li><li> Brazilian artist Mauricio de Sousa created most characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang">Monica's Gang</a></em> based on his family (all his sons and daughters, two based on his brother) or childhood friends - many times with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization">Tuckerization</a>.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundComics">Underground Comics</a> artists, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb">Robert Crumb</a>, his wife Aline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoriSeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoriSeda">Dori Seda</a>, Mary Fleener, Krystine Kryttre, Leslie Sternbergh, and so many others.
</li><li> Peter Milligan, writer of aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ShadeTheChangingMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ShadeTheChangingMan">Shade, the Changing Man</a></em>, confessed to doing this often, which his editor corroborated in the letters column. The character Miles Laimling is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">anagram of his own name</a>, and Shade's initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> perspectives and critiques of America were based on his own as a UK expatriate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a> has stated that during his run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>, he was able to define some of the characters in new ways, giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> a previously undefined reason for being angry at the world: Because he moves so fast, everything else is basically slowing him down to the point of constant frustration. David says this was directly inspired by his own impatient feelings whenever something slowed down his day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> did this sort of thing a lot. For instance, naming a group in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/03/27/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-148/">after the owners of a London comic shop<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or modeling an <em>X-Men</em> character <a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/05/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-158/">after his translator at a 1985 comics convention in Spain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Perhaps his most egregious example was the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> graphic novel <em>Debt of Honor</em>, which features at least a dozen of Claremont's friends as Enterprise crew members and the like, not to mention a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to a favorite band that several were associated with.
</li><li> Steve Moncuse, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FishPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FishPolice">Fish Police</a></em>, has said that lead character Inspector Gill was based heavily on him.
</li><li> Generally, comic book artists of varying degrees of quality tend to sneak in caricatures of themselves or their friends, coworkers, and family in their work from time to time.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> stories featuring Cal-Hab "trashzine" artist Kenny Who? and his misadventures with Mega-City One's A1 Comics were based on Scottish artist Cam Kennedy, who drew the strips, and his experiences with American comic companies. (The name comes from a conversation with an executive at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, which went something like "Hello, I'm Cam Kennedy." "Kenny who?")
</li><li> Probably the most famous examples in all of comics are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a> characters Mr. Miracle aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Scott Free</a> and his wife Big Barda. She is directly based on their creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>&#146;s wife Roz which makes him the Scott by extension. The Kirbys were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> for over fifty years until his death in 1994.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> based Stargirl's personality off that of his late sister.

Some of Brugera's personnel became recurring characters with defined personalities in those stories; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaEditor">head editor</a>, for example, is a mischievous, millionaire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a> with a penchant for long walks atop her pet elephant.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan">Brian K.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomDeFalco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomDeFalco">Tom DeFalco</a> had to often mediate between his brother, former soldier and a cop and said brother's daughter, who wanted to join the military against her father's wishes. He used that when writing dynamics between Peter and Mayday Parker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a></em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures">The Batman Adventures</a></em> featured a group of comedy villains called the Threatening Three, who were based on real-world superhero comics creators Denny O'Neill, Archie Goodwin, and Mike Carlin, all of whom had edited the main-canon <em>Batman</em> comics at different times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rocky">Rocky</a></em> is based on creator Martin Kellerman's own life and friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a></em> is also inspired by the lives of its creator Brian Lee O'Malley, his wife Hope Larson, and their circle of friends from their early 20s.
</li><li> Ma Hunkell, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RedTornado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RedTornado">Red Tornado</a>, was apparently based on a real woman who lived near creator Sheldon Mayer. According to Mayer, while she didn't actually become a costumed superhero, she would have if she'd thought of it. (The title character of the strip Ma appeared in was Scribbly, the Boy Cartoonist &mdash; who was, of course, based on Mayer himself.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herge">Herg&eacute;</a> based several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a> characters on people in his life:
<ul><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheBlueLotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheBlueLotus">The Blue Lotus</a></em>, Herg&eacute; created a young Chinese boy, Chang Chong-Chen (Zhang Zhongren in modern pinyin), inspired by his real-life friend Chang Chong-jen (Zhang Chongren), who he consulted on Chinese language and culture for the story. Chang also appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinInTibet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinInTibet">Tintin In Tibet</a></em>.
</li><li> Detectives Thompson and Thomson were based on Herg&eacute;'s father and uncle, who were identical twins and also endeavored to dress identically &#151; right down to the bowler hats and walking sticks.
</li><li> Bianca Castafiore was inspired by one of Herg&eacute;'s aunts. As a child, Herg&eacute; was forced to watch her aunt sing by his parents, something he truly disliked.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>:
<ul><li> Would you believe that Popeye the Sailor was based on a real-life person that E.C. Segar knew in his younger days, a local vagrant named Rocky Fiegel?
</li><li> Olive Oyl was based on Segar's schoolteacher (with her cartoon voice taking inspiration from actress Zazu Pitts), and Wimpy was based on William Schuchert, the manager of the Chester Opera House where Segar worked, and a nice man who shared Wimpy's fondness for hamburgers. Wimpy's full name was inspired by Wellington J. Reynolds, one of Segar's art instructors.
</li><li> In the cartoons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FleischerStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FleischerStudios">Dave Fleischer</a> wanted Bluto's voice to resemble that of the character Red Flack in the 1930 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigTrail">The Big Trail</a></em>, played by Tyrone Power Sr.

<ul><li> Stephan Pastis, the author, has on occasion inserted a cartoon version of himself, IN THE ROLE OF HIMSELF, into the comic. He even got killed in one story arc. The characters openly mock him. Strangely, the comic version of Pastis smokes, while the real one does not.
</li><li> One Sunday comic was featured from the (comically exaggerated) viewpoint of a neighbor. Pastis also frequently uses names of relatives, friends, coworkers, and sometimes real-life businesses.
</li><li> This led to a rather humorous story arc in which Pastis accidentally delivers his week's worth of <em>Pearls Before Swine</em> comics to Darby Conley, artist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GetFuzzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/GetFuzzy">Get Fuzzy</a></em>, who appeared as a cartoon version of himself. Pastis asks Conley to not look at the comics, but he proceeds to steal them and replace the main characters with the Get Fuzzy cast. The story concludes with Pastis calling to confront Darby on this and Darby blocking his number.
</li><li> The recurring character of bike enthusiast Jeff is based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz">Frazz</a></em> creator Jeff Mallett. Pastis and Mallett are friends but Pastis made Jeff obnoxious because that's just the kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark">strip it is</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> characters were named after acquaintances of Charles M. Schulz: Shermy and Schroeder were childhood friends; Charlie Brown, Linus, and Frieda were former co-workers; Van Pelt was the surname of a former neighbor. Spike was his childhood dog (whose personality served as the basis for Snoopy). Despite the widespread belief that Charlie Brown was Schulz's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>, most of the characters seem to have inherited various real-life Schulz traits. One of the more frustrating things about David Michaelis' Schulz bio was that he seemed to think that Lucy was exclusively a stand-in for Schulz's first wife when there was plenty of evidence within his own book that Lucy inherited Schulz's more irascible side. And the Little Red-Haired Girl was famously inspired by a red-haired woman who broke Schulz's heart.
</li><li> The Patterson clan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse">For Better or for Worse</a></em> is essentially a straight out copy of Lynn Johnston's family: a son, a daughter, a husband who was a dentist, a writer mother, a grandfather who fought in WWII... April was the first real deviation. The characters Michael, Elizabeth, and John were all named after the middle names of their real-life counterparts.
</li><li> One memorable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a></em> Sunday strip begins with Zonker chatting with a man who we've never seen before, who is drawn more realistically than the strip's usual style. In the final panel, Zonker introduces the man to Mike, saying "Mike! Meet the guy I'm modeled after!"
</li><li> On a similar note, Steve Dallas of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty">Bloom County</a></em> was based heavily, in both appearance and personality, on a guy Berkeley Breathed knew in college. He notes in the commentary for the first <em>Complete Library</em> volume that he "suspect[s] he was shot by an annoyed girlfriend, which saved [Breathed] many legal fees."
</li><li> Horse of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FootrotFlats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FootrotFlats">Footrot Flats</a></em> is based on a cat that hung around the writer's house. It is noteworthy because Horse is <em>badass</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">mean</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">borderline indestructible</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>:
<ul><li> Scott Adams based many of the characters on his real-life coworkers.
</li><li> A vegetarian that appears in one strip who insists that he may be weedy but is "deceptively healthy" bears a striking resemblance to Adams himself (who is a vegetarian in real life).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> is loosely based on Jim Davis' grandfather, James Garfield Davis. Also, Odie is loosely based on a guy he knew back home in Indiana.
</li><li> Calvin's dad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em> has many personality quirks that Bill Watterson has stated are exaggerations of his own father. He also gave the character the same occupation as his dad, a patent attorney. Commenting on one strip, involving Calvin's dad exclaiming about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLameFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLameFun">the joys of long runs in horrible weather and coming home to a bowl of plain oatmeal</a>, Watterson said simply: "This is my dad. No exaggeration."
</li><li> Richard F. Outcault named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BusterBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BusterBrown">Buster Brown</a>'s sweetheart Mary Jane after his daughter. She would also eventually lend her name to a style of children's shoes worn by both her namesake character as well as Buster. Buster's mother was also modeled after Outcault's wife as well.

</li><li> John Le Carr&eacute;'s <em>A Perfect Spy</em> is a fictionalized autobiography, except that Le Carr&eacute; became a novelist, while his character Magnus Pym betrayed his country and shot himself. Le Carr&eacute; explained that he wanted to write about his childhood, but in order to keep it from being a sob story, he made the son even worse than the father.

</li><li> <em>Ruth Ann and the Green Blowster</em> is said to be written by "Ruth Ann's Mother and Ruth Ann's Daughter." Little backstory there: Ruth Ann was a real person. Not a real person who went on an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em>-esque trip through a fantasy world, but a real person nonetheless. Her mother wrote a book about her when she was really little, but died when Ruth Ann was 5. Ruth Ann's daughter discovered the unfinished manuscript when she was little, and rediscovered it after Ruth Ann died, and decided to continue the story. Hence, the story is a collaborative effort beyond the grave between Ruth Ann's mother and Ruth Ann's daughter, about the many adventures of a 5-year-old Ruth Ann.

He also heavily wrote based on his own experiences, such as drawing on his time as a boxer for the fist fights or duplicating the time he walked across Death Valley as a young man to describe his heroes suffering in the desert.

</li><li> South African crime author (and occasional filmmaker) Deon Meyer has fallen in love with the small town of Loxton in the Northern Cape Province. Though not a permanent resident he owns a home there. Not only does the town feature in some of his recent novels (<em>Blood Safari</em> and <em>Spoor / Trackers</em> in particular) but he made two movies there (<em>Jakhalsdans</em> and <em>Die Laaste Tango</em>). In <em>Spoor</em> he references real people and places in the town (in particular a local restaurant) and in <em>Jakhalsdans</em> and <em>Die Laaste Tango</em> he cast some of them in bit parts.
</li><li> In Aldous Huxley's novel Point Counter Point, almost all the major characters are based on people Huxley knew. Phillip Quarles is based on himself, John Bidlake is based on Augustus John, Denis Burlap is based on John Middleton Murry, Maurice Spandrell is based on Charles Baudelaire, Mark Rampion is based on D.H. Lawrence, and Lucy Tantamount is based on Nancy Cunard. The leader of the fictional Brotherhood of the British Freemen (a fascist party), Everard Webley, is often assumed to be based on Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, however, at the time of Huxley's writing the novel Mosley was a prominent member of the Labour Party and wouldn't found the party until four years after the book's publication.

</li><li> The Weasleys' Ford Anglia in the second book is based on a car once owned by Sean Harris, to whom the second book is dedicated and who is more-or-less the inspiration for Ron. Rowling and Harris have been friends since they were teenagers, and they often went for long rides in that car. Rowling says that "I never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase."

The protagonists of <em>Let The Hurricane Roar</em> are even named Charles and Caroline, after Laura's parents.

When the Cowboys finished ahead of the Giants, under the terms of the bet, Martin had to kill Patrick in a horrible fashion in the novels. So, Martin gave Ser Patrick the sigil of a blue star on a silver backdrop (the logo of the Cowboys) and had him ripped to shreds... by a giant.

His main foe, Pickney Prescott, is actually the real admiral who hounded and tried to do him in. Doc Trembly's real name is Albert. The Minkster from his real-life story is never named.

</li><li> Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan's 2000 young adult novel <em>Esperanza Rising</em>, which is about a wealthy Mexican family that is forced to emigrate to a California migrant camp in the 1930s, uses this in spades.

</li><li> Brendan O'Carroll, author of <em>The Mammy</em>, based the character Agnes Browne on his own mother.

</li><li> The main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxAndRuby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaxAndRuby">Max and Ruby</a></em> were both based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells">Rosemary Wells</a>'s own young daughters which she mentioned during her <a class="urllink" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/09/07/our-lives/yoko-and-authors-other-furry-friends-help-kids-cope-with-childhood-challenges/#.VZsyRldA5zN">interview with Japan Times.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<ul><li> This is most evident with Moominmamma, who had a single line of description in Tove Jansson's notes: "Moominmamma=Ham", Ham being her own mother.
</li><li> Too-Ticky in <em>Moominland Midwinter</em> is based on Jansson's life partner Tuulikki Pietil&auml;.
</li><li> Other characters have less obvious or direct influences. Moominpappa shares Jansson's father's love for sea and adventure, as well as his distant nature. Snufkin was based largely on Jansson's once-fiance who also wore a hat like that, with the relationship between Snufkin and Moomintroll actually resembling the relationship between the two. Moomintroll is one of the author avatars for Jansson herself. Others include Little My and Toft from "Moominvalley in November".

<ul><li> Druss and later characters in the same vein were strongly based on his beloved stepfather Bill.
</li><li> The most prominent Drenai soldiers in <em>Waylander</em> were based on his journalist colleagues (who at the time had their jobs threatened by a rival newspaper group, after whom the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the piece was named).

She was a teenage girl with cancer, and an early member of the Nerdfighter fan community - after meeting at a Harry Potter convention they went on to exchange emails, much like Hazel and Gus do with Peter, and they remained good friends until her death in 2010. Her middle name was Grace, like Hazel's.
</li><li> Several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s stories, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOceanAtTheEndOfTheLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOceanAtTheEndOfTheLane">The Ocean at the End of the Lane</a></em>, <em>Mr. Punch</em> and "Queen of Knives", are inspired by events from his childhood and include characters based on members of his family. In "The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch", which recounts a strange occurrence that befell a group of friends during a night on the town, the three friends who aren't Miss Finch (who is <em>probably</em> fictional) are clearly Neil himself, TV personality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanRoss">Jonathan Ross</a>, and screenwriter Jane Goldman. The Beech Tree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust">Stardust</a></em> was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos">Tori Amos</a> (who then played the part in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation">Audio Adaptation</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADeadlySecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADeadlySecret">A Deadly Secret</a></em>, the novel is inspired by the tragic life story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JinYong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JinYong">Jin Yong</a>'s elderly servant when the author was a child.
</li><li> Venezuelan author Romulo Gallegos, when writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonaBarbara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonaBarbara">Do&ntilde;a Barbara</a></em>, wrote most of the characters based on people he knew or heard about during his travels through the Venezuelan flatlands.
<ul><li> The titular character of Do&ntilde;a Barbara was inspired by a woman named Pancha V&aacute;squez, who Gallegos never met personally. He heard about her from his friend Juancho Rodriguez, who told him about a woman, "who rode like a man. Greedy, superstitious, without fear of taking out anyone who annoyed her". While Do&ntilde;a Barbara is described as beautiful, Andres Eloy Blanco, a politician and poet who met Do&ntilde;a Pancha personally in 1920, said "she was pretty ugly, dark, almost black. Maybe she was beautiful when young, but now is not the case", and said she was prone to obtaining lovers.
</li><li> Lorenzo Barquero, according to a prologue to the 25&ordf; anniversary edition of the book was inspired by a doctor in law that became rich in the flatlands, but became an alcoholic. While Gallegos never said the name of the doctor, some scholars believe the character was inspired by two men: Dr. Galo Segundo Bram&oacute;n, a medic Gallegos knew when very young, and that his family always spoke very well; and Dr, Francisco Mier y Ter&aacute;n, who was a victim of alcoholism as is very likely the man Gallegos was referring to in the prologue.
</li><li> Mar&iacute;a Nieves was inspired by a worker from the flatlands Gallegos met, and he put him all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tuckerization">and name</a>, and the guy was flattered by this, and sometimes, when someone disrespected him, he would jokingly say "respect pal, that I'm in Do&ntilde;a Barbara".
</li></ul></li><li> Sam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABoyMadeOfBlocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABoyMadeOfBlocks">A Boy Made of Blocks</a></em> is based on the author's autistic son Zac, who has a similar diagnosis history and also loves <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>.

Not only does the main character's upbringing and problems mirror Mishima's own, everyone who read the book and knew the author confirmed it was blatantly autobiographical.

The main actors are also writers for the show and have stated that the characters are based on them, but then dumbed down, exaggerated, and thrown into crazy situations.
</li><li> Most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> is directly based on real people in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey">Tina Fey</a>'s life with Liz being her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>. In some cases, the real person actually plays the character they inspired, including Liz (obviously), Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan, and Jack McBrayer as Kenneth Parcell. Some people, including Alec Baldwin himself, see Jack Donaghy as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LorneMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LorneMichaels">Lorne Michaels</a> equivalent. It's also commonly assumed that Josh is based on Jimmy Fallon. To finish with the main cast, we must assume Jenna was originally intended to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a> of Rachel Dratch (who was originally slated to play the character) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyPoehler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyPoehler">Amy Poehler</a> &mdash;although that character quickly developed into someone else entirely... According to Tina Fey, Liz is "a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlidingDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlidingDoors">Sliding Doors</a></em> version of me, if I had never met my husband."

Ollie Plimsoles is based on someone Mark Gatiss met in community theatre, with Phil as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> of Gatiss himself.
</li><li> Catherine Tate admits to doing this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCatherineTateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCatherineTateShow">her self-titled comedy show</a>: Margaret is based on her mother, the "tactless woman" on Tate herself, and Paul and Sam on a couple she knows. She has also claimed that the Aga Saga Woman is based on a woman she met on the King's Road in London and Geordie Georgie on someone who wrote to her asking for charity donations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>'s Kurt Hummel is reportedly largely based on creator Ryan Murphy as a youth, particularly his interactions with his father

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>: The main characters are based on the real Jerry Seinfeld and his friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDavid">Larry David</a> and Elaine Boosler, plus Larry David's former neighbor Kenny Kramer. (Larry David provided the model for George Costanza, which may explain why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">David</a> was going to play George in the <em>Seinfeld</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow">Reunion Show</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em>.) The main reason why George got better as a character was because Jason Alexander found out Larry based him on himself and started playing the character as an exaggerated version of Larry.

In fact, Larry said that he'd considered getting someone else to play him in Curb, but thought "ah, who am I fooling?". He also notes that in both Curb and Seinfeld that he wrote things in the plot that happened to him in real life and how he reacted to them. Larry has noted that his Curb persona is slightly more antisocial than he is in real life for the sake of comedy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> is partially based on creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' younger days: Ted is based on Bays, Marshall on Thomas, and Lily on Thomas's wife.

</li><li> Another recurring character based on a real person is Jay Pharoah's Principal Frye, who is actually based on Jay Pharoah's high school principal from Chesapeake, Virginia. The only difference is in the name: on the show, the principal's name is Daniel; in real life, the principal is named James.
</li><li> The nerd character Todd Delamuca (or Todd Buttafuco) played by Bill Murray in some of the '70s episodes was originally named Todd Labounta, which was the real name of a guy a couple of the SNL writers had gone to high school with. They had to change the character's name because he threatened to sue them if they didn't.

It's true insofar as the main characters are all based on different aspects of Williamson's personality. He has also said that his own coming out, unlike Jack's, was pretty uneventful. Williamson also stated that film-lover Dawson and Joey were originally based on himself and a childhood friend. Though in real-life their relationship was platonic (obviously).

Tayler won the only ever Web Cartoonist Choice Award for Best Guest Appearance.
</li><li> Dave Anez of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge">Bob and George</a></em> not only shows up for commentary but actively directs the plot as the Author (a recolor of a helmetless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a> sprite). Authors from the other comics featured on the site frequently make guest appearances as well (Rick O' Shay being the most prominent).

Since the comic has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a> he goes beyond being a simple narrator and is arguably the character with the most screen time if you don't disqualify him for being a disembodied voice. Many of the fans of the comic who donated to the Kickstarter campaign also have avatars.
</li><li> This has happened several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault">General Protection Fault</a></em>, most notably in early December 1999, when lead character Nick spends several strips arguing with cartoonist Jeffrey Darlington about having a Y2K storyline (Nick was strongly opposed to the whole idea, but lost the argument). Nick is also heavily based on Darlington, and Ki is based on his wife.
</li><li> Scott Kurtz rarely interacts directly with the characters in his comic <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.pvponline.com">PvP<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, but frequently does offtopic strips featuring (real life) arguments he has had with his father over technology, pop culture, and the direction the comic is going. These are frequent enough that "Scott's Dad" is listed on the character page.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em>, the characters of Tycho and Gabe look nothing like their real-life counterparts, either in looks or (broadly speaking) personality. This is because they hadn't originally been intended to represent the authors, though they've since joyfully dived into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished">Life Embellished</a>.

Also, in those later two themes, the characters are based directly on characters in his real life role-playing games. They're the same group, which is why Alvissa and Kyros are nearly identical in personality to Paris and Serron.
</li><li> When Chris Onstad of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Achewood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Achewood">Achewood</a></em> speaks with his characters, all you can see are his legs (and once, hands).

</li><li> In-universe, Davan based the villain of a play that he re-wrote off of his father, Fred, justifying it as needing the villain to be the most interesting person in the play.
</li><li> And Monette plays a television character based on Davan.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MacHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MacHall">Mac Hall</a></em> started out when Ian McConville drew some intended <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> guest strips, based on himself and his dormmates. He posted them on his door, and people liked them, so he started doing more. Matt Boyd (whom Ian knew from the popular fansite Bungie.Org) joined the cast and took over writing duties. Notable is the fact that the two didn't meet in person until a year or so into the strip's run.

There's a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a> involved; the admittedly self-loathing Eastwood is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> in the comic, ill-tempered Lothar is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, easygoing Virus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>, and Silversword... is actually a subversion, his character Rogue (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RougeAnglesOfSatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RougeAnglesOfSatin">not Rouge</a>) isn't really based on him at all, which the strip points out.
</li><li> Riff from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> is based on an old friend of Pete Abrams's.
</li><li> This is practically every character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em>, due to Chris-chan writing himself into the story as some kind of hero beating up his real-life enemies. And thus naturally most of the stuff written by other people to wind Chris-chan up also applies. Whose characterizations have more basis in reality is up for debate, though. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisSimile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisSimile">If by "debate" you mean "Chris portrays himself as some manner of God-figure, and everything goes downhill from there."</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Enjuhneer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Enjuhneer">Enjuhneer</a></em>'s artist bases almost all of her characters on people she actually knows.
</li><li> Piro and Largo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MegaTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MegaTokyo">MegaTokyo</a></em> are both based on of the original authors, Fred Gallagher and Rodney Castor. Ed, Dom, and Tsubasa are based on their friends, and Seraphim is Sarah, Fred's wife (then girlfriend.)
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Springiette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Springiette">SPRINGIETTE</a></em>, all characters are based on real people. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="urllink" href="http://www.springiette.net/strips/170">But there's a reason for that<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></span>.

The only one <em>not</em> based on anyone is Zaff.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HijinksEnsue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HijinksEnsue">Hijinks Ensue</a></em> are openly based on the author (Joel) and his two best friends (Josh and Eli). It sometimes devolves into photo comics, which often include other cartoonists at conventions with silly speech bubbles and, in one memorable instance, photos of the real people from <a class="urllink" href="http://hijinksensue.com/2011/03/31/elis-bachelor-party-fancy-photo-comic/">Eli's bachelor party<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

</li><li> Most of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WastedTalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WastedTalent">Wasted Talent</a></em> by Angela Melick are her friends or family members, usually with a nickname in place of their real name (mostly in early strips though, Red and Lucky still have their nicknames, but other characters have real names). Of note are her colleagues, identified by workplace, who were invented as fake people so Angela could avoid accidentally writing a comic about someone who wouldn't appreciate it.
</li><li> The four main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/EddsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/EddsWorld">Eddsworld</a></em> are named and modeled after creator Edd Gould and his friends who also work/worked on the show and comic.
</li><li> The three main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BanzaiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BanzaiGirl">Banzai Girl</a></em> are creator Jinky Coronado and her best friends Katie and Michelle. Presumably, their real life has fewer aliens in it.
</li><li> Nearly every main character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeenieLicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeenieLicked">Weenie Licked</a> is someone who frequents the site hosting it.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU">Kill la Kill AU</a>, Amoridere stated that she tends to think of Nui being more or less like a benign version of her youngest sister and Ryuuko and Satsuki being more akin to herself (Ryuuko being the hotheaded and cynical half, while Satsuki being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfReason">Voice of Reason</a> half) and Ragyo and Soichiro being loosely based off her father and his mother.

Most then used themselves as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> and other members as inserts, though in a couple of cases, some were uncomfortable with being used in stories they weren't following, and asked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">stop appearing</a>.

Rather ironic considering the premise, but an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> is not <em>necessarily</em> a badly-written character, and most of them tend to become less and less like their authors over time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SurvivalOfTheFittest">Survival of the Fittest</a></em> has a ridiculous number of self-insert characters or characters that are fictional versions of people the handler knows in real life.

Though Groening has admitted that Bart was based, at least in part, on his own brother Mark and Lisa was based more on himself than her namesake.

</li><li> All the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> are based on Danny Antonucci himself, his family, and people he knew growing up. The Eds were all aspects of his personality (with their names being based on his own middle name of Edward), Jimmy was based on a cousin, Jonny was based on a loner friend who spent time with a blanket, Rolf was based on his experiences as the son of Italian immigrants, and the Kankers were based on a group of girls he knew during his 7th Grade school year.
</li><li> Many of the characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> are supposedly based on people that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Parker and Stone</a> met in their hometown of Fairplay, Colorado or at school in Boulder. Trying to figure out who they might be is a favorite pastime of CU undergrads. The most commonly accepted one is that Chef's visual appearance is modeled on Chef Willie from Sewall Hall.
<ul><li> Stan and Kyle's respective parents are named after Parker and Stone's, and Stan's father Randy and sister Shelley are both heavily based on their real-life inspirations &mdash; particularly Shelley, who actually was abusive to Trey when they were kids (while the violence was nowhere near as bad as it was on the show, the real-life Shelley did punch Trey, push him down the stairs, and lock him out of the house on occasion).
</li><li> Parker and Stone have said in interviews that Stan and Kyle were originally based on each of them respectively, but in retrospect, they realize that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatMe">really more like Cartman.</a>
</li><li> Cartman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">self-deluding</a> attempts at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealingTheCredit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealingTheCredit">Stealing the Credit</a> in "Fishsticks" was based on people the creators know in the entertainment industry, where they honestly believe they came up with ideas despite putting little to no effort into them.
</li><li> Kenny is based on a friend of Parker's who was also poor and wore a parka that muffled his speech. He would often be absent from school, and the two would joke that it was because he was dead, which is where the "They Killed Kenny" joke came from.

One of the random waterbenders Katara trains with is based on a relative of one of the artists and the swordmaster Piandao is based on the show's martial arts coordinator/consultant, and the instructor of one of the creators, Sifu Kisu.
</li><li> Brendon Small, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em>, created by Brendon Small, should really need no further explanation.
</li><li> Mordecai from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> basically just J.G. Quintel as a bluejay. He even voices the character using his normal speaking voice.
<ul><li> Similarly, the main character and his family in Quintel's following series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloseEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloseEnough">Close Enough</a></em>, is directly based on him, his wife, and their daughter.
</li></ul></li><li> Joe Murray wrote the recurring character of Ralph Bighead on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> as a less stable version of himself. The show's staff caught on and convinced him to do the voice himself - because they wanted an excuse to hear the normally monotone Murray yell.
<ul><li> Mr. and Mrs. Bighead were based on a real-life pair of neighbours who lived next door to him while he was growing up. Like Mrs. Bighead, the wife had a raspy voice and frequently flirted with younger men, and like Mr. Bighead, the husband had a reputation for confiscating any toys that ended up on his yard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> has the titular character based on Rebecca Sugar's younger brother Steven, and the main three Crystal Gems based on facets of her personality.

</li><li> Lola from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndLola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndLola">Charlie and Lola</a></em> is based off an inquisitive young girl that author Lauren Child met on a train.
</li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> based several characters on people they encountered, like the surveyors in "Survey Ladies" and Candy Chipmunk from "I Got Yer Can". Nicholas Hollander based Katie Kaboom on his teenage daughter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Twilight Sparkle</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> to be like her mother.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> Gang were based on people the creators knew: T.J. was based on various childhood friends they both had, Vince was based on Paul Germain's friend of the same name from college, while Spinelli was based on a mutual female friend from the same college. Gretchen was based on co-creator Paul Germain's wife in elementary school, Mikey was based on two friends the creators had in middle school, and finally, Gus wasn't based on anyone in particular but rather the fact they both moved around a lot as kids.
</li><li> Tree Trunks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> was based on and voiced by Polly Lou Livingston, a longtime key figure in the local arts scene in San Antonio, TX and old friend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PendletonWard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PendletonWard">Pendleton Ward</a>'s family.
</li><li> Marc Brown has admitted that several characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a> are based on people from his life. Arthur is, of course, him as a kid, Grandma Thora is based on his grandmother, who encouraged his writing/drawing, Francine is based on his sister, Sue Ellen is based on his childhood girlfriend, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElTigre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElTigre">El Tigre</a></em>: Series creator Jorge Guti&eacute;rrez based the series' fundamental conflict of Manny having to choose between following in the footsteps of his superhero father and supervillain grandfather on his own childhood in Mexico City as the son of an artist and the grandson of a military man. Also, Manny and Frida's personalities are based on those of himself and his wife Sandra.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>, the protagonists are a pair of twins loosely based on creator Alex Hirsch and his twin sister Ariel. The voice of Grunkle Stan originates from a grandfather whom Alex faintly remembers and Soos is based on a friend from college. The idea of the show taking place during summer vacation came from the Hirsch siblings staying with a great-aunt of theirs during one summer.
<ul><li> Asked to describe the show, he once said "<em>Gravity Falls</em> = <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> + <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> + Making Fun Of My Sister."
</li></ul></li><li> The entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em> was based on the creator's real friends and experiences he had in college, which he ironically dropped out of to make the show. The voice acting is almost entirely himself performing impersonations of his friends, and he even managed to get one of them to voice the character she's based on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em>: Dan and Chris are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a> based on the flaws of creators Dan Mandel and Chris Pearson, while Chris's wife Elise is loosely based on Chris Pearson's wife... also named Elise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> is based on creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisSavino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisSavino">Chris Savino</a>'s own experiences growing up in a large family. That said, the five Loud girls who were given the names of Savino's sisters (Lori, Luan, Lynn, Lana, and Lisa) don't share personalities with their namesakes.
<ul><li> It's been revealed that a common way for stories to get made into scripts is for someone in the writer's room to say "X happened to me as a kid."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: Star Butterfly and Marco Diaz are based on Daron Nefcy and her husband, Bobby Miller. <a class="urllink" href="https://preview.redd.it/lgnjqbvu9kg31.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97ee20f586fba4cb20f48daf12b781b6200345d1">The two of them even cosplayed as their respective counterparts once<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
