At that moment the legitimate method of earning it may be slow, difficult, or unprofitable, while at the same time there's an illegal or unethical option that offers quicker gains to whoever can get away with it. On the other hand, assuming that the shady option is <em>always</em> the most expedient is a mistake that leaves a lot of would-be villains not only punished, but broke as well. They may think they're acting in their own interest, but often they screw themselves over because they don't realize that they could have done better&mdash;or at least reduced the risk of being caught and defeated by the heroes&mdash;by using more honest means.

This may be more a factor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">maintaining the Status Quo</a>, and it's usually mentioned that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder">mad</a></em> after all. Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> at a villain's death with "If only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood">he'd used his powers for good</a>, instead of for evil." The example is contagious; even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> gets a hold of secondhand ultratech, they just use it for ill-conceived attempts to either conquer other nations or abuse their citizens.
</p><p>Sometimes this trope is subverted by villains who start out using their talents for legitimate gain, but who end up becoming villains for one reason or another. Sometimes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> villain <em>does</em> market his inventions, but only to finance grander schemes and sometimes remarks, "How do you think I got all my equipment without attracting attention?" Another subversion can be when the villain really <em>does</em> go straight, and is able to use the skills he demonstrated in his criminal career to land a legitimate job. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMadScientist">Reluctant Mad Scientist</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBoredom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBoredom">Rich Boredom</a> may justify it because the character already is swimming in money and is seeking something else.

As the decades passed villains became more complex but the trope is still around in some form. When this is avoided, the turn to the side of good is usually planned well in advance. Heroes may even precipitate it by simply asking "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThenWhat">And Then What?</a>".
</p><p>This trope could almost be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>. For all the criticisms thrown at comic book supervillains, quite a few real life criminals make this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, due to the difficulty of those with criminal records getting honest work. It was common practice of (legal) casinos in Las Vegas - and later Atlantic City - to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecruitingTheCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecruitingTheCriminal">hire men who (successfully) ran illegal gambling operations</a> in other parts of the country, because these people had specialized skills and experience in the gambling trade. And even now, casinos sometimes hire known cheaters to catch other cheaters, because they know all the tricks.
</p><p>Finally, there's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">Logical Fallacy</a> that seems to assume that because someone manages to invent some sort of amazing new product, they will also automatically be successful at marketing it. Just because someone has the science smarts to develop something brilliant doesn't necessarily mean that they also have the business smarts to sell it effectively... and if you try and sell your product to a business, there's always the danger of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> cheating you out of your rightful share of the profits. Indeed, many villains' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> is kicked off by such failures in such legitimate or even good uses of their talents.

<ul><li> The Team Rocket trio in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> invent some of the most impressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Traps</a> one could ever imagine, almost every episode... until they occasionally run out of money. It's mentioned in one episode of the Johto series that they borrow their traps from Team Rocket, and that they were invented by the R&amp;D at their HQ. They're also not above taking and maintaining legit work, until the inevitable screw up, and it's always manual labor anyway. Ironically, their "honest" work is almost always profitable. And they always prove to be much better at whatever work they do for extra cash than they ever are at being bad guys. They'd probably have better lives if they just <em>stopped</em> chasing Pikachu.
<ul><li> They once tried to set up a memorabilia stand for some Pok&eacute;mon tournament, and did well. Then they sank all of their money into it, just in time for the tournament to end and the market for their stuff to disappear. In fact, Jessie eventually started entering Pok&eacute;mon contests; not only is she pretty good at it, she has won a few, even progressing quite far in the Sinnoh Grand Festival. James also acts like pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> Brock on occasion, showing potential to be a great Pok&eacute;mon breeder. Meowth, being able to speak both Human language and Pok&eacute;mon language, also could be filthy rich if he stopped being a criminal and just became a translator. In the Pikachu short film "Pok&eacute;mon &mdash; Gotta Dance", Meowth is apparently a genius in that he invents a Pok&eacute;baton that can control Pok&eacute;mon. However, he just uses it to make Pok&eacute;mon dance, and he ends up allowing it to be destroyed. Meowth is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a>; James mentioned that the cat's the one responsible for most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that they throw at the twerps!
</li><li> Considering just how dependent the Pok&eacute;mon world is on the titular creatures, you'd think a Meowth that fluently spoke human language could give invaluable insight into the intelligence, psyche, and behavior of the creatures, <em>especially</em> since he's already solved a handful of issues in the show simply because he was able to understand what they were saying. Team Rocket is always trying to capture Pikachu because he's unique for a Pikachu. However, you want to know what else is unique for a Pok&eacute;mon of its type? <em>A Meowth that can talk</em>. Even taking into account the fact that Pok&eacute;mon that can communicate directly with humans are not unheard of, Meowth is one of the only ones that can articulate human speech as opposed to using telepathy or some kind of translation machine, and he is probably the only non-Legendary Normal-type that can do so. Adding to the fact that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a>, being a low-level flunky for a mob boss that ignores him is so beneath him and his companions.
</li><li> In a short arc of the <em>Best Wishes</em> series, Meowth poses as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceMole">Heel&#150;Face Mole</a> towards Ash's team, winning them over with his negotiator skills. While it was all just an act to lure them into another Pokemon-stealing trap, he was actually rather good at it most of the time, ending up solving several dilemmas the heroes ran into on their journey. Back in <em>Diamond &amp; Pearl</em>, <em>another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceMole">Heel&#150;Face Mole</a> venture nearly turns into a legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> after the heroes point out Meowth's talents could easily make him a TV celebrity. However, just on the way to finding some media connections, the heroes start their usual beatdown on Jessie and James, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">and he just doesn't have the heart to turn his back on them</a>.
</li><li> Utilised since the Sinnoh era. It is revealed that Meowth has exceptional culinary abilities due to his precise Fury Swipes. He ends up using it alongside Jessie during her contest run, helping her get a top spot. He does the same in the Kalos showcases, where it again is usually received well. In the Pokemon short "Eevee And Friends" the heroes' Pokemon even entrust him to make a banquet for their party.
</li><li> Also subverted in that the few occasions Team Rocket actually <em>tries</em> to make a legitimate business, either demand fades, or it's the one time in a million that the twerps actually see through their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguises</a> and drive them out of business.
</li><li> In one dubbed episode, the trio actually does well enough in a legitimate business venture that the three momentarily consider leaving Team Rocket to pursue a new life. It just so happens that Ash and Pikachu walk right by, and the three promptly ditch their stall and go back to their old ways. They're just that obsessed with the yellow electric mouse.
</li><li> In <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> their circumstances force them to largely stay in one place and they end up opening a food truck to run during their off-hours. Despite a few struggles at first, it actually becomes fairly successful! They become so accustomed to their new routine that they even declare that honest work is enjoyable! (but then of course, they immediately feel that there's something completely wrong with that statement; THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HARDENED CRIMINALS DAMMIT!!!). Additionally they become part-time MC's for a wrestling tournament. The reality is, it's clear Team Rocket is good at just about anything that <em>isn't</em> stealing Pok&eacute;mon.
</li><li> What makes their obsession even worse is that Ash's Pikachu is, at least at first, no more powerful than any Pikachu could hypothetically become: It <em>does</em> display an unusually strong electric attack during Team Rocket's first encounter with it, but this is because Ash is pumping it full of electricity, making it stronger. You could do the same with any other of its kind (and probably any other Electric-type, for that matter). Later on, Ash's Pikachu is actually shown to be one-of-a-kind, very powerful and able to do things no other Pokemon can. It still applies, as most of what he does can be done by other Electric-types, and his unique Z-Move, 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt, <em>only works with Ash</em>.
</li><li> "Pikachu's Goodbye" is an extreme example: Team Rocket attempts to poach a group of wild Pikachu (along with Ash's, naturally). They completely fail to realize that they could just, you know, <em>battle and capture the Pikachu like any other wild Pokemon</em>. Only one of them has an owner.

</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, when minor villain Wapol actually starts a new life and builds a massive toy-making empire by using his powers to recycle objects into toys. In fact, the alloy his power creates (dubbed "Wapometal") is apparently a unique and amazing compound, which makes him even richer when a scientist discovers its properties and Wapol begins capitalizing on that. Heck, thanks to this discovery, he even gets his own kingdom (Named the Evil Black Drum Kingdom) and marries a supermodel! Ironically back to being an evil King, but this time kinda better. Later in the series, Franky starts building tanks using the revolutionary metal.
</li><li> An unexpected version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a> NEXT</em>. Martina is horribly, comically hopeless as a villain, but turns out to be sufficiently talented in retail and handicrafts to raise a small army of thugs out of her profits from selling (and making) paper flowers for a few episodes.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> when Nice (who qualifies as a villain only in the sense of being a criminal) invents a new form of explosive and immediately sells it to the mining industry.
</li><li> Akihiko Kayaba of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> almost averted this, having created and sold an extremely popular total-immersion virtual reality game, presumably making truckloads of money off it. But then he decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMostDangerousVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMostDangerousVideoGame">remove the logout button and fry the brains of anyone who dies in the game</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He also enters the game himself, and eventually disables his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">God Mode</a>, allowing Kirito to kill him... making him a meta-version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a>.</span> Why?

Sugou Nobuyuki even lampshades it in the Fairy Dance arc:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sugou</strong>: Mr. Kayaba was a genius, but he was also a fool. All he wanted to use his technology for was his game. He couldn't see the potential.

</li><li> Seto Kaiba in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> averts this heavily, especially in the manga. He created the Solid Vision hologram system as a way to torture defeated opponents and the miniaturized Duel Disk to counter an opponent's mind-reading. But, as the head of a gaming corporation, he's very much aware of just what the benefits of portable lifelike holograms are for entertainment purposes, and indeed, his uses of them against his opponents are as much revenge plots as they are product showcases and beta-tests. It's largely thanks to his technology that Duel Monsters becomes the most popular game in the world, and in pretty much every sequel or spinoff, it's shown that KaibaCorp is well past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> level, with its machines integrated into every level of society.

Pre-Crisis, this was pretty much played straight. In fact, the specific scene that named the trope featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Lex Luthor being brought in to consult with some government officials who wanted to wipe out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a>. Luthor was introduced as an expert, "charging one million dollars for a ten-minute consultancy". After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, Lex Luthor was retooled into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">amoral billionaire industrialist</a>, subverting this trope by showing that he was still a brilliant scientist and engineer, but had used his inventions to become fabulously wealthy.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElliotSMaggin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElliotSMaggin">Elliot S! Maggin</a> beautifully subverts this trope in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">Pre-Crisis</a> novels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastSonOfKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastSonOfKrypton">Last Son of Krypton</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MiracleMonday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MiracleMonday">Miracle Monday</a>,</em> which assert that Lex regularly maintains multiple false identities as prominent scientists, businessmen, and even artists; and that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys">how he is always able to raise the money necessary for the equipment and hired minions</a> his world-conquering and Superman-busting schemes require. In other words, Lex is perfectly capable of playing the legitimate marketplace like a fiddle and <em>regularly does so as a matter of course,</em> but because he views himself as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">&Uuml;bermensch</a>, he considers the idea of just playing by society's rules and getting rich and famous to be <em>beneath him.</em> He only views the money thus earned as a means to an end &mdash; that end being conquest of the world and the destruction of Superman, two things polite society frowns upon. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">although no one remembers it</a> (a fact Maggin has lamented), the name "LexCorp" actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">originated</a> in Maggin's story "The Ghost Of Superman Future," a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> that depicted Luthor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">going straight</a> in his old age and marketing his inventions, as well as becoming friends with Superman again <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">as they had been in their</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy">youth.</a>
</li><li> A year or so before the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvWolfman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvWolfman">Marv Wolfman</a> wanted to write a story where Luthor "goes legit" and becomes a respected businessman, in the process <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">gaining the public's trust</a> and therefore becoming a much harder opponent for Superman to fight. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Editorial</a> considered this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">too big a departure</a> for Luthor and nixed the idea, so Wolfman rewrote the script with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a> as the villain in question. The resultant story feels a little forced, as Superman seems to take the whole thing very personally, despite the fact that he and Savage didn't have anywhere near the history that he and Lex did. By Wolfman's own account, this is where the idea for Lex's Post-Crisis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> persona originated.
</li><li> In post-Crisis continuity, it is established that Lex Luthor became a corporate tycoon through his invention of the Lex Wing, a military airplane that Lex claimed made him an aeronautical revolutionary on the scale of John Glenn, or Neil Armstrong.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthorManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthorManOfSteel">Lex Luthor: Man of Steel</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip">Perspective Flip</a> into Lex Luthor's day-to-day life, we see more of Lex outside of plotting to kill Superman. In the series, he has both built the Science Spire, a giant skyscraper-research lab-tribute to human ingenuity and bankrolled Hope, a new superhero <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who is actually an elaborate artificial human. It's ultimately deconstructed, as he ends up destroying both as part of a plan where the main outcome seems to be "make Superman look bad to people". For all his humanist talk, Lex's obsessions with Superman are blinding him to reality and the good he could be doing for others</span>.
</li><li> In several stories, this is shown to part of why Superman cares so much about Luthor, and at times, pities him. Superman may be powerful, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">it's been shown many times that his brute force abilities can't change the world easily</a>. Luthor, on the other hand, is a scientist, and therefore capable of helping people on a completely different level. If he put his mind to it, he could probably cure every disease, eliminate hunger and poverty, and bring humanity to the stars. Instead, he takes time off from extortion and corporate skulduggery to stuff space rocks into robots and hold orphanages hostage.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> enemy and off-and-on Luthor ally Prometheus, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype">Shadow Archetype</a> of ol' Batsy who also happens to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> of such talent that Lex actually offers to cut <em>him</em> a check in exchange for the advanced technology he's come up with. Prometheus turns him down, though, because he also happens to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> who only sees his technology as a means to an end (destroying institutions of justice) and, like Bronze Age Lex detailed above, sees the idea of making money legitimately as beneath him.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler">The Riddler</a> is almost the patron-saint of this trope. It's been shown countless times over multiple media that, if Edward Nigma actually used his amazing intellect for honest endeavors, he'd be rolling in cash. It's also been shown that he also could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">a MUCH more formidable criminal mastermind than he is</a> if he merely focused on the task at hand instead of following his obsession with riddles and trying to prove he's smarter than everyone else. On occasion he's <em>tried</em> to commit robberies without leaving riddles, but he just can't resist the compulsion to send them Batman's way <em>without even consciously realizing it</em>. When Batman told Riddler, Eddie realized that he really is insane and needed treatment.

Hush says in a throwaway line that Fries is ahead of his time, and the work he'd done could merit a Nobel Prize if he'd done it legitimately.

He started in his youth as an idealistic scientist brimming with ideas to change the world for the better with superscience even Luthor would gape at. Then he met the corporate world.

If Juggy ever did go legit or try to be a less mindlessly destructive villain, Cyttorak would depower him.

Not long after, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">Juggernaut was in a fight with the Hulk</a> and to get the power he needed he cut a deal with Cyttorak that he'd return to his evil ways afterward.

</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TomStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TomStrong">Tom Strong</a></em> storyline showing the alternate reality of Tom Stone, Tom (Stone) manages to convince would-be science villain Paul Saveen to use his genius for good by pointing out that while his plan to hold the city for ransom with his recent discovery phlogisten could get him thousands, selling phlogisten as a cheap heating source would make him a millionaire.
<ul><li> Earlier in the same conversation, Saveen all but directly stated that he was turning to villainy because his inventions up to now had gone ignored; for instance, there's no market for his flying car in Millennium City because they can't safely navigate the city's system of cable cars.

His employer treated him as disposable, and drastically underestimated the importance of the reveal. Also <em>literally</em> inverted later in the same series when the same group of villains who hired the Floronic Man hire Lex Luthor as a consultant to help take out Swamp Thing because, as one of them puts it, "He has a certain amount of experience in fighting invincible enemies." The consult takes five minutes, for which Luthor is paid $10 million.

Both collaborating together created an even more advanced model of superpowered android whose AI successfully developed concepts deliberately left out of her programming, while the hardware was advanced enough to fool Superman's enhanced senses. However, neither is overtly interested in actual cash &mdash; Ivo's motivation is his severe thanatophobia, since he only developed the machine as a means to develop actual immortality. Morrow is just uncaring about such things, thinking he can always just rob another bank as long as he can keep developing his machines, and in the rare occasion he actually pays for anything, he just hacks the seller's account to pay for his purchase.
</li><li> Upheld in Demon #0 (Garth Ennis series, 1993-1995), where the human host, Jason Blood, as an unscrupulous World War I arms merchant, wishes to use the titular character to bring about an earlier Allied victory. However, the Demon likes all the bloodshed, and human depravity brought on by the war, and goes against Mr. Blood's plans.

<ul><li> In the story "My Little Town", the villain is an alien who is using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkRay">Shrink Ray</a> to shrink Earth's cities, then sell them as "highly accurate miniatures" in order to earn enough money to repair his spaceship. Mickey forces the alien to re-enlarge each city, then points out that there's a faster and more honest way the alien can make money with his ray&mdash;by buying a cheap, tiny diamond and enlarging it to a colossal size.
</li><li> Pete could easily find himself a honest job and even become rich through his organizational skills and the other skills he gained as a criminal... But he remembers the time he was one of Mouseton's most dangerous criminals and <em>respected</em> as such, so he refuses unless not doing so would mean starvation or he's forced by the law (he was even sentenced to work as a street cop on two separate occasions).
<ul><li> One excellent example is when his common law wife Trudy found some honest friends and convinced him to make at least <em>one</em> attempt at getting a honest job without trying to get himself fired with poor performance: Pete went to work for a security agency as a consultant and showed them <em>all</em> their weaknesses and how to eliminate them, at which point they had to fire him because they didn't need a consultant anymore... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan">Just As Planned</a>.

But after years attacking the Money Bin their stubborness kicked in and they just don't <em>want</em> to get rich any other way. At most they occasionally steal some money to finance their attacks on the Money Bin.

</li><li> Many Spider-Man villains, like Vulture and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> version of the Shocker, zig-zag this trope: They started out wanting to be legit entrepreneurs and inventors but after being victimized by unscrupulous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> types they turn to crime. Subverted, perhaps even Deconstructed, with retcon-villain Clash, from the Post-Secret-Wars Learning To Crawl subseries in The Amazing Spider-Man. A brilliant nerd (not unlike Peter) who was present as Spider-Man's first fight with Crusher Hogan, Clash begins using his supreme intellect to craft a "superhero" identity for himself, utilizing sound wave. His intention is to be an entertainment act, like Spider-Man was before Uncle Ben's murder. Instead, he winds up quite believably sliding down the Slippery Slope before becoming a full-on supervillain, who gets thrashed by Spidey, arrested, and because of his criminal record, forced to be a henchmen for several years. Finally, he runs into Spider-Man again, who promptly offers him a job at Parker Industries (on the condition that he leaves his Clash shenanigans behind).

Huge profit potential, right? Except he was actually removing a disguise field on the items, one put in place at least a full day before. The military and espionage applications for the disguise field and its counter, and thus the potential for vast profits, should be fairly obvious. He and his partners used it as a way of evading tariffs and duties on high-end goods.

The reason for this trope is also pointed out - most villains don't have the social skills or business savvy to make legal money off their powers; most of them can only think of using them as a club. Of the ones who have both the smarts and the people skills, usually the various mad scientists and variations thereof such as Leonard Snart (Captain Cold), most of those guys are usually legitimately insane or mentally ill and don't care or want legal work. Snart is brought up as a specific example, he has severe paranoia and psychosis due to his abusive father and isn't capable of functioning in a civilian setting.

In spite of this, they decide it'd be a great idea to deliberately engineer the Indominus rex, a killing-machine dino, for a military contract, using facilities on the park itself. Predictably, the Indominus escapes, kills dozens, and basically destroys their entire corporate empire overnight. Apparently, they were planning to double-dip and make it another attraction along with filling out the contract, but as the Indominus doesn't look too different from their current stock, and its genetic modifications include <em>camouflage</em>, it's a wonder how they thought it'd be successful at that past the novelty.

Over the course of the film, he is motivated by a desire to prove that his mecha is much more effective in fighting crime than the robots. That he believes AI is evil is just the icing on the cake. On the other hand, his mecha <em>is</em> overkill for urban policing, even in Johannesburg. One wonders why neither he (as an ex-military man), nor his boss, tried to arrange meetings with actual military officers who would have lapped up an advanced combat mecha like that.

And on top of that, when you consider what they are able to accomplish with their research, they'd probably make much, much more money pursuing something legitimate and marketable, as opposed to selling mutants and skinless dogs on the black market.
<ul><li> What makes it even sadder is that all the money that was invested in making these biological weapons could have vastly improved the lives of the civilian world. All these villains could have helped people had they wanted to and still have made a huge profit off of it.
</li><li> Edward Ashford, one of the three original founders of Umbrella, did indeed want to research the regenerative abilities of the Virus, if only for the scientific value and potentially healing the sick. He, however, contracted a viral infection (unspecified if it was related to said research). As Marcus, the other founder besides Spencer, had no business acumen, Spencer was left the defacto leader (until Marcus's assassination).

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted in that it turns out any usable form of the life-extender machine is completely useless without Australium, which is both extremely expensive and hard to get a hold of, due to Australians being extremely protective of it. It doesn't help that the Announcer seems to be trying to <em>destroy</em> the entire world supply of the stuff for as-of-yet unrevealed reasons.</span>
</li><li> Much of this is that Blutarch and Redmond are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">flat-out bad businessmen</a>, which is a lot of why they got into that problem in the first place. Namely, they came to the inexplicable conclusion that producing <em>gravel</em> was a viable industry, and most of the land they bought up was endless pits of the stuff that they swore would be worth a fortune. (Oddly, Zepheniah, their father, agreed - part of what made him so angry was that the gravel pits <em>didn't even have any good gravel in them.</em>)
</li><li> Then their secret third brother comes in and points out how they been squabbling over worthless piles of (literal) gravel, both ignoring the one thing worth a crap, Mann Company which is owned by Saxton Hale. Of course, he then sends armies of robots that run on <em>money</em> to take over it...
</li><li> Gray Mann lampshades the use of money as a fuel source in his robots because, while it was a lapse of judgement (along with the praising protocol), he never thought the conflict would be this prolonged, which is actually starting to bankrupt him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This causes him to later develop the Engineer Bot and when that failed as well go through Saxton's own policy to claim Mann Corp through fisticuffs (which also involved loophole abuse), as he was fighting the war at a loss at that point and can't afford to prolong it the way his brothers did.</span>
</li><li> Averted in the case of the Mercenaries themselves, who'd happily go along with whatever insane plan their employers come up with without a second thought because they are paid very well. It's probably why none of them ever counseled or questioned Redmond and Blutarch Mann; had the brothers wised up to any of this then the Mercenaries would have killed the proverbial golden goose.
</li><li> Comically played straight with the Pyro, who's apparently savvy enough as a leader to bring massive financial success (completely offscreen of course) to a company he was only at for a few months at most. Of course, being the Pyro, he was unsatisfied with the job and instantly bailed when Miss Pauling offered a chance to set things on fire. With the exception of the Engineer, every other Mercenary fell on hard times because killing people in comically hilarious situations was apparently their sole marketable skill.

While they keep the artifacts themselves a close secret, they've reverse-engineered a lot of the ancients' technology and shared it with the mass market and have profited enormously thereby.

Rather than offer this to researchers, historians, and documentarians to permit humanity to gain a never-before-attained glimpse into the truth of the past, they instead form an entertainment division dedicated to selling video games and feature films with dumbed down, mass-market dreck based on heavily edited and propagandized versions of the lives that they've unearthed. The given justification is that making money and benefiting humanity are secondary to their main goal of turning humans into easily controlled sheep.
<ul><li> There's one additional element revealed in the series (mostly II): the Templars effectively invented modern capitalism and its institutions as a way to conceal their activities in an increasingly connected world from an increasingly literate and informed public, for roughly the reasons they helped end aristocratic traditions. Just as nobody questions why a random person wields great power in a world where it appears any common citizen can succeed and eventually wield great power, nobody questions why a business concern (or later corporation) is doing things if those things clearly make money. Effectively, Abstergo already has <em>wealth</em> (what money can buy): they only make money to obfuscate how much of what they have money actually <em>can't</em> buy. They view a profit motive as one of their manipulative tools; it's no surprise they don't value it themselves.

In another he was apparently comically evil enough to spend all of his resources <em>teleporting in a cube of frozen urine as a practical joke</em> (which Cave Prime had to melt with hairdryers before it could be teleported out).
</li><li> Cave Prime initially came up with the initiative because building the testing arenas was bleeding him dry (he still hasn't figured out he could sell his inventions, which at this point included <em>a multi-dimensional gate</em> and proving that there are other universes in existence) and instead wanted to con other universes into building the arenas for him. Subverting it in that he did end up making a profit, but not by selling his inventions. Rather he managed to get his man to jump through enough universes to find one made entirely of money.

Notably, Batman and Robin only discover the Scarecrow's plans when Robin is accidentally doped with fear toxin along with his college football playing-friend.

Ignoring the fact that his fortune came from about a hundred other enterprises including his inheritance, he's obviously not aware of how much money and praise will get <em>showered</em> at him if he were to unveil the holy grail of medicine; sometimes publicity is more valuable than the product. Not to mention that not even his <em>original</em> reasoning makes sense. Since we see him after having taken the drug, we can assume that it is a <em>cure</em> for cancer, not a <em>vaccine</em>; otherwise he would have never had to deal with the cancer in the first place (unless there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">some reason why he wouldn't want a cancer vaccine in his system</a>.)

If he'd just flown it over to the board meeting and shown it off, Osborn would have been thrown out of the building and Toomes' company would have been rolling in money. Instead, Toomes took up the identity of the Vulture to assassinate Osborn for trying to take over, which cost him everything.
</li><li> Staunchly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Villainous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Villainous">Villainous</a></em>, as the main characters are in the business of weapons development. A number of the shorts involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Black Hat's</a> attempts to market the inventions of his main henchman, Dr. Flug, to other villains.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em> plays with this trope alot with Lord Boxman. Supervillain and leader of Boxmore, his company makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a> for other villains (and the various models are seen with his "children.") One in particular being Professor Venomous, whom he grows close to. However, he's also a nut who's more focused ond destroying Lakewood Plaza and has been in deep water with his investors. Season 1 ends with Darrel (the basic model, a one-eyed red robot) rat him out and launch him into the sun with him taking over.
<ul><li> Of course, he comes back in Season 2's second episode. His attempts at reclaiming his company fails and a talk with the Lakewood Plaza trio makes him realize that he was a bad buisnessman, compared to Darrel, who has been more focused on running the company properly. However, Boxman's praise is enough to get Darrel to try and attack the Plaza.
</li><li> This contrasts with Professor Venomous, a suave bioengineer who's a frequent customer and friend of Boxmore. He makes alot of money with his work, but it becomes clear that he hates the bureaucratic business rules and he's drawn to Boxmore because he is so devoted to fighting heroes. It's this that leads to Venomous buying out Boxmore from the investors and running the place together, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">with all the implications it entails.</a>
</li><li> And as for Venomous' motivations? <em>Whoo boy. That's a spoiler:</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out he's actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a> Laserblast. He was insecure on how his power relied on that of others. He invented his helmet to shoot lasers to exploit that energy. He was researching to try and augment himself before his carelessness led to him trying to dispose of the evidence and seemingly "killing" himself. Everyone thought he was dead, but he survived and hearing Carol say he could not have survived that was the final blow to his fragile ego, especially since he lost his own powers. He spent years trying to recreate his superpowers, but instead fell to the dark side as he savored the power, wealth and prestige his work got him. However, he would grow bored with just making money and he was drawn to Boxmore's passion of fighting heroes, likely because of how Boxmore was secure in who he was, compared to the insecure Venomous. As such, while selling his work got him the power, it was only after he went full circle did he fully get the security he sought out. Oh yeah, and he's KO's biological dad</span>. <em>Phew.</em>
</li><li> Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and revelations happen that changes the dynamics of thw two. Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Laserblast/Venomous is also Shadowy Figure, or rather the latter is a manifestation of the fears and darkest aspects of Venomous, much like how TKO is that of his son, KO. He succumbs to his lust for power because of his insecurity and Shadowy Figure fully takes over as Shadowy Venomous. Now off the rails, he plans to become the only person with power while Boxmore tries to reign him, but fails. After KO and TKO merge and save the world, Venomous is restored to normal. Boxmore ends up retiring and leaves the business to his kids and even gets back together with Venomous</span>. The show does a fascinating job at showing several aspects of the profitability angle, but also the motivations and how they change over time, especially as circumstances change what people want.

<ul><li> Doctor Alchemy somehow got his hands on the Philosopher's Stone &mdash; giving him the power to create infinite amounts of riches, transmute any substance to anything else, psychokinesis, and makes him immortal. He uses it to commit petty crimes which repeatedly get him sent to jail. This is lampshaded extensively and hilariously in the opening narration of <em>Manhunter</em> #7.
</li><li> Mirror Master is arguably the greatest inventor in the history of the world. He has created such devices as a matter duplicator, teleportation, and interdimensional portals. The first Mirror Master used these things to rob banks, the third uses them for mercenary work. If they just sold them they could become obscenely rich and not have to get the crap beaten out of them by a pajama-clad speedster. The third Mirror Master actually ruminated on this once, that he and most of the people he ran with could become filthy rich beyond anything they could earn in petty crimes if they sold even half their individual tech, and that people had outright pointed this out to him before. He, however, concluded he LIKED running around being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supervillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supervillain">supervillain</a> far too much to really consider going legit.
</li><li> In another story, a police detective who is forced to team up with Captain Cold calls him out for his criminal tendencies, pointing out how a man who invented a device that could manipulate matter on a molecular level (his "Cold Gun") would have had no problem getting rich legitimately. The Captain responds by pointing out the detective's preference for expensive suits despite their impracticality in his line of work. "We all have our vices." He's also admitted that many of the Rogue's villainous tendencies boil down to bad habits.
</li><li> In a Silver Age story, the Flash encounters the villain Element Master, whose gimmick is, well... the atomic elements. In the climax of the story, Element Master says he discovered a new element (the creatively dubbed "elemento") that is a sort of magnetic light, which he uses to <em>send the Flash to the Moon</em>. Ignoring everything wrong with that idea, if it were true, Element Master would've completely changed the way we look at the elements, magnetism, Einstein's theory of relativity, and space travel, easily becoming the most important scientific figure in recent history. Instead... he tries to steal stores of "elements" like gold, platinum, and diamonds (carbon).
</li><li> Averted by villain the Chunk, who gave up supervillainy and used his suction powers (being able to siphon off material to another universe inside his own body) to start a personal removal business.

For example, Dr. Alchemy has two personalities; one of them is an incredible douche who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">thinks of all other humans as insignificant</a>, so he thinks that sharing his Philosopher's Stone is beneath him, while the other is more benevolent but can't actually make the Stone.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the Marvel comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesForHire">Heroes for Hire</a></em>, a mercenary named Paladin breaks into a special armory where the props and weapons of various former gimmick villains are stored, seeking valuable weapons to both arm himself with and to sell. He comes across the "alchemy gun" of the former supervillain Chemistro, and comments amusedly that "This guy invented a gun that could turn lead into gold, and all he could think of was to rob banks with it". Moments later, he had a lightbulb moment, saying "You know what? Forget the rest of the stuff, I'm good with just this." He immediately tries to escape with his prize, realizing of course that he won't need to steal and fence the other items once he has a device that can make gold, but unfortunately the heroic female version of the Scorpion destroys the gun while trying to subdue him and prevent his escape. He is understandably furious. He presumably was unaware of the fact that any object transmuted by the alchemy gun turns into dust after exposure to heat or after a certain amount of time.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire">Luke Cage</a> would eventually comment that Chemistro was just one of those guys who had power and wanted to throw it around so people knew he meant business. If he turned things into gold and made himself rich, no one would be afraid of him or know who was boss. Chemistro's alchemy gun is in fact a subversion. In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>, Curtis Carr tells Tony Stark that he has in fact tried to create new alchemy guns by attempting to duplicate the radiation field that gave his original gun its powers. As much as Carr might <em>want</em> to mass-produce his invention and get rich that way, so far he's had no luck.
</li><li> Even if he just had the one gun, there are millions if not billions to be made by hiring yourself out to turn dangerous and unwanted things&mdash; think nuclear waste, surplus WMDs, or <em>other</em> Mad Science gadgets&mdash; into gold, then letting them disintegrate into harmless powder. Or he could just turn random objects into gold, sell them for big bucks, then be gone before they disintegrate. Illegal, but not in the high-profile way that tends to attract superhero attention. Or for <em>that</em> matter, there's surely some industrial process for which some company would happily "rent" large quantities of short-term gold.
</li><li> All that aside, Curtis Carr was another subversion in that he invented his alchemy gun intending to get rich <em>legally</em>. However, he developed it on company time using resources owned by the company he worked for. Curtis's boss said that meant the gun was legally the company's property, and the boss wasn't likely to pay Curtis royalties. Curtis's original reason for becoming Chemistro was to go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against his crooked boss, which led to the boss hiring Luke Cage for protection.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> The comic loves to simultaneously avert, lampshade and justify this trope, by pointing out negative implications of letting weaponized supervillain tech (or, more frequently, Iron Man's repulsor tech) out into the world. Once one of his enemies implanted repulsor-variant technology into terrorists' bodies, turning them into high-end suicide bombers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hundreds were killed and Stark Industries was completely wiped out.</span>
</li><li> Iron Man once defeated a villain called the Living Laser. An alternate universe comic has him simply hiring the certified genius as Tony Stark. Unfortunately, this doesn't work because like most villains, he doesn't fit into society. This is arguably the best reason for not cutting Lex a check... villains who don't fit in still don't with money.
</li><li> Gregor Shapanka, the original Blizzard, is another subversion who started out as a legitimate Stark International engineer. However, he embezzled money from Stark's company to finance his own personal projects. When Stark fired him for theft, Shapanka became the costumed villain Blizzard to get revenge on Stark.

<ul><li> In the <em>Tarnished Angel</em> arc, Steeljack interviews the loved ones of supervillains who had recently turned up dead. The boyfriend of the Chain said that he always thought the Chain's technology to transfer one's consciousness into a metal body had a lot of potential in deep sea or space exploration, but whenever he brought that up the Chain would look at him like he was an idiot and say he didn't understand.
</li><li> Steeljack himself acknowledges this many times in the arc; whenever Astro City's low-level villains did manage to pull off a successful scheme, they would inevitably try to blow all their cash on their next scheme because "this is the next big heist, this is the one I'll retire with." By their actual retirement years, most of these local terrors and master criminals are living in slums, unable to find gainful employment because nobody trusts them. Steeljack muses at one point that he could have put his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion">Chrome Champion</a> body to work in a legal manner as a soldier or an explorer, but he was a low-level thug who lucked out, so of course the only thing that occurred to him at the time was using it to smash through bank walls.
</li><li> Deconstructed in Volume 2, Issue 10, "The Old Villain With the Money." Hiram Potterstone became the Junkman precisely because he <em>wasn't</em> allowed to work legitimately anymore, having been forced into retirement by the company he founded and not being able to find work elsewhere due to his age. And when he manages to pull off a bank heist and retire to Rio, he finds he's ill at ease because nobody ever found out who did it. He didn't want the money, he just wanted people to recognize that he was still brilliant. He ends up going so far as to recommit the crime, just so he can get caught and have his crimes on the public record.
</li></ul></li><li> Minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> D-lister Alexander Gentry is a subversion. He started out as a weapons designer for the military and developed a suit of porcupine-themed armor equipped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">a wide variety of different weapons</a>. Gentry thought that the U.S. government wouldn't pay him what he deserved for the armor, so he kept it for himself and became the supervillain Porcupine. Given how badly his villain career turned out, he probably would have been better off selling it to the military....

<ul><li> An issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> lampshaded and subverted this trope with Ultimate Shocker. Unlike the main universe version, the ultimate version is a real loser seen as a joke by everyone and constantly mocked by Spider-Man. However, after learning that Shocker had created his blasters himself, Spider-Man asked him why he didn't make a fortune selling the technology. The subversion: Shocker reveals that he <em>had</em> worked for a big company creating inventions, and while said company made even more money, he was fired without seeing a single cent. Which also added a tragic aspect to the formerly laughable character, because he also explains how he studied at MIT until his eyes bled.

When the Man Who Would Be Hobgoblin first examines the Green Goblin's cache of equipment, he remarks on how incredible the technology is. Specifically, that the personal bat glider must surely represent a breakthrough in the field of aeronautics, and how this proves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a>'s insanity, since he could have made far more money by patenting the design than he could ever have hoped to by using it for crime. In his very next breath, however, the man states that keeping such a thing to yourself would be one part of proving yourself better than those around you, and thus using it for personal gain makes sense.

It works, just that some people don't like that idea. By the end, he's even technically a reserve member of the Avengers.
</li></ul></li><li> The Vulture is another one of those subversions who started out making money honestly. It was only after he had been ripped off by his business partner that Adrian Toomes decided to use his new flying harness as a professional criminal. In one of the Web of Spider-Man comics he actually goes further into this when asked by a fellow prisoner (who was the leader of a gang blackmailing him to build a vulture suit to fly out) why Toomes didn't just sell his technology (his partner is gone and can easily build the equipment with little resources &mdash; he was making it in prison for at least the second time). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He tells him that since the partner who betrayed Toomes looked down on him as weak, he uses the equipment to do whatever he wanted so that no one ever would think he was weak again.</span>

At first he was both a supplier to criminals and a criminal himself. However, after too many defeats that almost proved lethal for him, he gave up committing crimes himself, but still worked as an underworld weapons supplier. He may be an egomaniac (something that Spidey himself has called him) but he is perfectly lucid and could probably bring in far more profit if he worked for honest customers. (To emphasize how good he is... he's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> type. His inventions usually tend to have some sort of mechanism in them that he can trigger if a client refuses to pay him, making sure that they regret it.)
</li><li> Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Dr. Octopus</a> in most of his incarnations: He was a scientist who invented and used his arms for legitimate research purposes. It took a lab accident fusing the arms to his body and driving him insane to turn him into a supervillain. Further subverted with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a></em> version of Dr. Octopus. He was caught in an explosion as per usual, but S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist Henry Pym let his condition deteriorate to the point where his arms couldn't be removed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>.

He later escaped from prison twice, both times attempting to continue his revenge spree against first S.H.I.E.L.D. and then his ex-wife, who was trying to profit off of his story. Upon subsequent arrest and running out of people to get revenge on, Ock made a deal with the FBI to use his knowledge of Spider-Man's DNA to produce Spider-Man clones for the agency. In the end it's played straight in a fight with Spider-Man, as Ock realizes that he <em>likes</em> being a supervillain, even if it's stupid and doesn't work out for him.
<ul><li> Even further subverted by him once he steals Peter Parker&#146;s body and becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a>. He decides that with his new lease on life that he&#146;s going subvert this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed Richards Is Useless</a> by becoming the, well, superior Spider-Man, attempting to prove that given the chance he would be a greater hero than Parker ever was. He even manages to start a mega-corporation, Parker Industries.
</li></ul></li><li> Actually, Spider-Man himself is a good example. Peter Parker invented a web-casting technology that can hold guys like the Rhino for up to an hour if he gets it on thick enough. He can fund the creation of more web fluid with a freelance photographer's salary, and the only thing he uses it for is to fight crime, all the while worrying about Aunt May. If he sold his web shooters to Police/Swat/SHIELD they would have an inexpensive, non-lethal way to hold villains that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a> and Peter could afford to get Aunt May regular access to doctors at world class hospitals. Back when he was a teenager the legal hurdles might have been problematic, but now that he is buddies with Tony Stark it seems like Stark's lawyers could help smooth that stuff out (and Nick Fury likely being eager to push defense contractor money through the bureaucracy in exchange for web pistols for all his agents). Peter doesn't even need to stop being Spider-Man.
<ul><li> Spider-Man has tried to sell his web before, but usually as more household-friendly items like glue. Chemists were interested in its strength, until they realized it dissolved in an hour, and Peter hadn't gotten around to making a more permanent formula. Since Spidey once used his webbing to <em>hold together a damaged building</em> until the cops could evacuate the area, there'd also be a solid market in using it to shore up damaged or unstable buildings and environments until more permanent supports can be built and brought in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, Peter is taken on-board the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, escapes, and gets his hands on one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">expanding goo-firing pistols they already have</a>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> comic series does a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> of this trope when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doctor Octopus</span> pulls a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a></span> on Spider-Man and begins using his technology both to fight crime more effectively and make a profit as well. Unfortunately, using his technology that way allows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Green Goblin</span> to <em>hijack it</em> and use it to further his own criminal schemes.

</div></li><li> A later issue of that same series reveals that apparently, Spidey foe Mysterio is actually something of an aversion of this. Turns out that a few years back Mysterio copyrighted the term "Sinister Six" behind the backs of his teammates. Now whenever other villains try to use the name for team-ups he forces them to pay royalties. Given how many villains have tried to steal the name since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dr. Octopus's death</span>, this was probably a pretty smart move.
</li><li> The first novel in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SinisterSixTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SinisterSixTrilogy">Sinister Six Trilogy</a></em> discusses the irony of Mysterio's situation. The main thing that pushed him over the edge and caused him to become a supervillain was that he was an underpaid B-movie makeup and effects artist who felt nobody appreciated him or took his work seriously. Now, in the age of modern sci-fi and superhero blockbusters, someone with Mysterio's skills could make <em>millions</em> by working on major Hollywood productions, but his criminal actions have damaged his reputation to such a degree that he has zero chance of landing a legitimate job ever again.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures">The Batman Adventures</a></em> the DCAU's version of the Riddler ultimately defies this trope by marketing some communications equipment he made for a criminal scheme as an advanced cell phone.

</li></ul></li><li> Averted when, at one point, the Riddler is seen chatting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePenguin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePenguin">The Penguin</a>, who has discovered he can make more money as a legitimate businessman selling cheaply made merchandise at extortionate, but legal, markups.

He used to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">mind controlling</a> hats to commit crimes, feeling that the riches he made this way would make him happy. So did he realize that he could cut out the middleman and sell the technology for all the riches he wanted? No! He realized that he could use the hats <em>on himself</em> to become blissfully happy whenever he wants, thus cutting out <em>two</em> middlemen. He still commits crimes, but now it's just for fun.
</li><li> In one comic, where Batman was relating to one of the Robins all of the death traps that he has foiled, Batman mentions a Haunted House of Death that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheScarecrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheScarecrow">The Scarecrow</a> created to try and kill Batman. Robin states that Scarecrow would have made a fortune in the entertainment industry, making haunted houses for theme parks. Batman actually states that he recommended that to the Scarecrow after capturing him, but, Scarecrow being Scarecrow, he didn't listen. More generally, the Scarecrow could probably have named his own price for selling his fear toxins to spy agencies like the CIA or MI6, or to political dictators. Instead, he prefers to pursue his own research using the people of Gotham as his unwilling guinea pigs.
</li><li> In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> establishes up a fashion magazine as part of plan to steal a fur coat. Think about what the investment versus return on that particular caper must have been. Somewhat justifiable; the Catwoman &mdash; no matter her incarnation &mdash; isn't in the game for the profit; she's in it for the rush.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <em>Batman</em> story has a character named Carlos who had a phony mind-reading show; Bruce figured right away he was using code words to get the answers, gaining real mind-reading powers following a car accident and emergency brain surgery that "Fate slyly played its hand in". He does use his power to make money somewhat legally at first, in card games and radio shows, but decides to turn to crime so he can make even more money. He hits this trope head on when he learns Batman and Robin's real names, but can't think of anything better than to blackmail them into keeping away from him. It bites him on the ass when his last robbery victim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySecretIdentity">fatally shoots him in the back</a> while he's distracted fighting Batman</span>.
</li><li> There was another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> <em>Batman</em> story featuring a person with a photographic memory. Despite graduating from college with <em>every degree possible</em>, this guy couldn't get any work better than stage acts. He was recruited by mobsters so that he could memorize secret information without taking the relevant documents themselves and later sell said info, under the condition that the mobsters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">don't kill anyone during their jobs.</a> The man's skills are proven when he forces Batman to fight dirty, renders him and Robin unconscious via nerve pinching, and <em>perfectly copies the Batplane.</em> Ultimately, since this story takes place during WWII, the story is subverted when Batman saves the man's life and recommends him to the Army so his talents can be used against the Axis to atone for what he's done.
</li><li> Victor Fries, or Mr. Freeze, was originally an inexplicable cold-based villain, already falling under this trope. The guy has a gun that turns thermodynamics upside down and rather than patent that and claim his Nobel, he robs banks. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> established he was trying to save his frozen wife and committed crimes to get the necessary funds. He was a downright sympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>. He's also essentially ageless with a technology that could be invaluable to the rest of the world. Given he's not just in it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>, one's got to wonder why he doesn't just go legit, prove what he's done, and wait for university and corporate backers to line up just for a chance to throw resources at him. One comic suggested that, while he is not in it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>, he's also not willing to part with any of his inventions (with the occasional case-by-case exception) until Nora is all fixed. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, Hugo Strange pokes at this idea when he speaks with Freeze, claiming that Victor could have cured Nora a long time ago if he'd gone to others for help and not spent his time working alone and blaming others. Considering that it's <em>Hugo Strange</em>, however, it's debatable how much of that he actually believes - Especially since Freeze's chronologically first appearance in the Arkhamverse shows that Fries <em>did</em> try asking others for help at first, only for Boyle to never honor his side of the agreement, which is what drove Victor to attempt the experiment that Boyle interrupted, which turned Victor Fries into Mr Freeze.
<ul><li> Considering the commonality of his origins and his backstory, Victor was always a bit troubled until he met Nora and the incident that turned him into Freeze also appeared to give him severe trust issues.
</li><li> It still doesn't explain why Batman never contacted his 'good friend' and public sponsor Bruce Wayne to employ Fries to work on his own terms. Avoiding this trope is part of the reason that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> retconned Victor into a lunatic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nora was never his wife. She had been frozen for over fifty years, and he fell in love while doing his doctoral thesis on her.</span> The fandom was not pleased with this retcon.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Linkara</a> points out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth">The Agony Booth</a> review of <em>Batman</em> #147, that the scientist Garth could have patented an age-reversing ray instead of working with jewel thieves.
</li><li> In <em>Shadow of the Bat</em>, there was this one Batman villain named the Human Flea who invented a device allowing him to jump extraordinarily high. The Human Flea went around robbing diners to save his father from going bankrupt. After capturing the Human Flea, Batman tells the supervillain that he could make himself rich off patenting his invention. The Human Flea responds that he never thought of that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a> falls into a variant of this that actually exists in real life: ecoterrorism, wherein an attempt at enacting social/environmental change is done in such a way that discourages people from doing as desired. Making things far worse than real cases, she really is an absolute genius with plants, able to create miraculous strains that could solve all <em>sorts</em> of environmental problems that harm the plant ecosystem, the sort of thing she fights for... if only she would market her creations on the legitimate market, rather than turning them into weapons to try and wipe out all humanity, if not all animal life. For instance, she could bring about an instant end to logging by selling seeds for a tree that produces wood that can be harvested in large quantities without killing the tree (and does so much more frequently than letting trees grow the old way), instead of making trees that have digestive systems and eat loggers.
<ul><li> Batman even tried to reason with her in a one-shot issue where she planned to murder a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who had napalmed an island (killing plant life <em>and</em> the poverty-stricken humans who lived there) telling her how much good she could do with her powers if she tried. His speech convinced her to spare the man's life (brainwashing him with her pheromones into confessing to the police) but nothing more.
</li><li> In general, Poison Ivy's inability to market herself productively is generally given a simple explanation: she's absolutely <em>batshit insane</em>. Whilst whether or not she was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists">eco-extremist</a> before her transformation varies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, after her transformation, she completely lost her mind. At best, she's become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar">Tautological Templar</a> who can't understand that non-violence would actually make her message more convincing. Furthermore, there's also that despite Ivy's supposed ideological motivation, her crimes also have a selfish motivation driven by her past as a mousy wallflower with strict parents and being used by the college professor she liked for the experiments that turned her into Ivy. Presumably, her crimes (such as subjugating and seducing men) are done out of her spite.
</li><li> In the Convergence comics, when Poison Ivy loses her powers and Gotham is hurting for food and supplies, several different versions of Ivy become the city's best assets. Her knowledge of plants helps keep the population from starving, and her fighting experience with Batman means that no one is going to steal from her.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted with Roman Sionis, aka. "Black Mask". Before he took on his alias he was, like Bruce, a wealthy entrepreneur from an established Gotham family... and he failed <em>miserably</em> at it. It was only after he elected to go around with a blackened wooden mask and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">feed bits of people to other people</a> that he really found himself in his element.
</li></ul></li><li> One scene from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt">Patton Oswalt</a>-penned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League of America</a></em> story "Welcome to the Working Week" sees Batman convince Flash's enemy the Weather Wizard to sell his latest weather control device to Wayne Industries (who will use the device to help irrigate deserts) for $50 million plus royalties rather than use it to rob a bank, which would likely only net the criminal $30,000 to $40,000 at most. Batman also hints that the royalties might be enough to allow the Weather Wizard to retire from his life of crime. The Wizard actually seems to be thinking about it.
</li><li> Marvel's Plantman has the same problem as Poison Ivy, except he was always considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">pretty lame villain</a> by heroes, and didn't care much for the environment, only using his powers for selfish reasons or a deluded dream of world conquest. Spider-Man once called him out on it with the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood">You Could Have Used Your Powers for Good</a> speech (to which the villain thanked him for the career advice, but said he "always had my heart set on world domination", and Plantman <em>himself</em> admitted in <em>Paradise X</em> how much more well-off he'd have been if he had used his powers to fight world hunger. (Of course, he seriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a> when he joined the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em> and changed his name to Blackheath.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker">Sleepwalker</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted with the villain 8-Ball, who actually started out working for a defense firm as an engineer, before he was fired when his employers thought he was selling company secrets to pay his large gambling debts, leading him to create his weapons and costumed identity.
</li><li> Subverted with Spectra, who first got a job in a laboratory so she could rob the place, only to obtain superhuman powers after Sleepwalker interferes in the robbery. At first, she seems poised to become a criminal, but when she reappears it turns out she's gotten a legitimate job using her light-generating powers.
</li><li> One of his first villains was Crimewave, who wanted to, among other things, kidnap models and hold the valuable clothes they were wearing hostage... using his remote-controlled, armored van with a tentacles-and-guns self-defense system. This is justified, as the bad guy cares more about fame&mdash;he even has his own cameraman&mdash;than actually making a profit or toppling Kingpin.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> comics by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird when Baxter Stockman, already very wealthy from his legitimate technology company, begins using his Mouser robots for crime. When April asks him why he'd do it when he's already rich, Stockman, who is already mentally unhinged to begin with, simply claims that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">it's fun</a></em>!
</li><li> Doctor Lovecraft in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a></em> initially did legitimate work for his company, but when they pursued financial wrongdoing, they allowed him to pursue more dangerous experiments to create mutates to steal for the company. As these mutates later devolved out of sentience, this explains why he could not have gone public with his results.
</li><li> The Trapster follows this trope to a T. He invented a type of super adhesive and decided to use it to rob banks instead of just patenting it, for some reason that they never explained. He even got a pardon after his first criminal outing, by helping the Avengers defeat Baron Zemo and yet still went back to crime after that. In a rather excellent print short story, the Trapster completely subverts this trope. He changes his name and begins selling his products on behalf of a Seen on TV company. His inventions are successful, he starts dating, and he even gets to ham it up on television. Unfortunately his old colleague the Wizard sees him enjoying himself and threatens him into going back to his Trapster identity and threatening a live studio audience, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but his girlfriend talks him down in a touching <em>on camera</em> scene just before U.S. Agent clocks him in the jaw. As the story ends, Trapster is a sympathetic reformed criminal who keeps the girl and his job and gets legal representation to help clear up his parole problems</span>. None of this is canon.
<ul><li> In a much later issue, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> fights the Trapster, and notes that the villain's traps are all incredibly advanced and well designed. While beating the stuffing out of him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualDangerDialog">Panther casually mentions</a> that he might have work for the Trapster when he gets out of jail.
</li></ul></li><li> The third issue ever of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> has an inverted invocation of this trope: the villain in this case, the Miracle Man, is a stage magician who used his skills as a hypnotist and illusionist to fool the Fantastic Four into thinking he had powers far greater than theirs. Then he used these powers to fight them off as he went around stealing jewelry. Reed Richards ultimately deduced that his powers were phony and pointed out that if those powers were real, the Miracle Man could easily have conjured up all the jewels and treasure he wanted without having to stoop to such petty thievery in the first place.
</li><li> Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAtom">The Atom</a>'s foe the Bug-Eyed Bandit, who became a criminal because no one <em>would</em> buy his technology &mdash; no one would fund his research without a working model of it, but he couldn't build a working model of it without funding. Eventually, he got so ticked off that he just stole the money he needed, built his tech at last and used it to become a career criminal.
</li><li> Linkara called the one-shot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> villain "The Surgeon General" on her whole organ-stealing shtick, which inherently relies on being a <em>skilled surgeon</em>. Of course, what Linkara probably forgot is this schtick is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, and the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_trade">organ trade<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is very real, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">That Other Wiki</a> shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em> tends to do this in varied ways. "Tank Man" is simply talked into giving up his murderous ways and settling down (it doesn't turn out well, but they tried). Jacob Krigstien is given an outlet for his world-changing habits by being allowed to do it in a non-killing-people way. An animal-abusing psychopath is put on retainer for when the Authority needs to get information out of human-abusing psychopaths.
</li><li> Hilariously subverted in the short-lived DC parody comic book the <em>Inferior Five</em>. The would-be superteam's first nemesis was Dr. Gregory Gruesome, a brilliant, evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who was so poor he lived in a dilapidated wooden hut in the middle of a junkyard and his sole henchman was a dim-witted vagabond. Despite lamenting about his inability to "turn out multi-million-dollar missiles like they were paper planes" like this trope's namesake, he actually created some remarkably effective machines by cobbling together garbage, scrap, and various other odds and ends.
</li><li> The Trickster:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in one <em>Robin</em> issue where he's beating up the Trickster. He points out to him that he has shoes that can walk on air, and by mass producing them, he'd be ten times richer than Bruce Wayne. Instead, he rents himself out as a mercenary.
</li><li> In an earlier issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueDevil">Blue Devil</a></em>, the first Trickster is also asked why he didn't market his shoes. He points out they've just finished a storyline in which he tried to do that and the buyers tried to A) kill him and B) forcibly secede California, though he does consider trying to resell to a "reputable" organization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">like SKULL</a>. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, he may have been more interested in the attention than the money.
</li></ul></li><li> The Prankster, one of Superman's less dangerous enemies, uses elaborate pranks and gags for his crimes, often using them to delay or distract Superman rather than outright battle him. At one point, he became a professional hero-distracter, doing things like putting people's lives at risk so Superman would let crooks get away to save them. This worked so well for The Prankster than he even had a full staff of well-paid assistants to help him plan all the distraction's details, including which current events would be more distracting when disrupting them with his pranks, and how much time he needed to keep Superman distracted while the villains and crooks hiring Prankster could commit their crime and escape.
</li><li> Superman fought a guy called Funny Face during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a>; an unsuccessful comic strip writer, he was <em>much</em> better at science, inventing a device that could bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife">comic strip characters to life</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">enlarge them to titanic size</a>. Superman couldn't even <em>touch</em> these guys, much less fight them, and the only way he even <em>found</em> the villain is when Lois, who had been kidnapped, got the idea to write the address of his hideout on one character's shirt before the device was used. Still, Funny Face used it to rob banks and museums. In fact, the next time he appeared - much later, in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllStarSquadron">All-Star Squadron</a></em> - the heroes were dumbfounded as why he'd be stupid enough to use his miraculous invention for something as petty as pulling robberies.
</li><li> In the 2017 holiday issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em>, Superman encounters a desperate bank robber who built a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">Jet Pack</a> in his garage after losing his job at a lab, and convinces him to use his intelligence for good and patent it after he gets out of jail.
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> I'm sorry, you built this <em>in your garage</em>? <br><strong>Robber:</strong> I mean, yeah I, the guys at the lab all said I was crazy, they- <br><strong>Superman:</strong> You built a <em>jet pack</em> in your garage and your first thought was, "I should use this to commit a crime"? <br><strong>Robber:</strong> ...Well, when you put it <em>that</em> way...
</div></li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Bananaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Bananaman">Bananaman</a></em> comics in The Dandy had this with a villain (well, his villainy was trying to scare the hero), running a fancy fake haunted house with holographic ghosts and what not. It subverted the trope because at the end, the villain DID do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> and use his abilities to run a theme park Haunted House ride.
</li><li> The Circus of Crime may be D-list villains, but they're excellent circus performers. If they would go straight and abandon the "hypnotize the crowd and rob them blind" shtick, they could pull in plenty of money without getting beat up and thrown in jail. At least one comic had them propose doing that... then lament that it wouldn't really be all that profitable, since not too many people care about the circus anymore. (Indeed, the reason they turned to crime in the first place was because their leader, Maynard Tidboldt the Ringmaster, felt his relatively small circus couldn't compete with the enormous ones that Americans were familiar with. Thing is, more modern depictions of Tidboldt's circus are rather large and seem pretty good in comparison.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a></em> has a subversion in <em>Flight 714</em>. Dr. Krollspell has developed a working, if unperfected, <em>truth serum</em>. Now, you might reasonably assume that every intelligence or security agency in the world would pay a king's ransom for it. However, instead of marketing it, Dr. Krollspell takes a job from Rastapopoulos to use it on millionaire Laszlo Carreidas to get a bank account number. This trope could even conceivably apply to Rastapopoulos too. He could have bankrolled the distribution of a massive invention... except that the truth serum <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">doesn't work,</a></em> as Carreidas ends up babbling on about everything <em>except</em> the bank account number. Rastapopoulos could have injected Carreidas with Rajaijah Juice and gotten the same result.
<ul><li> The serum <em>does</em> work, the problem is that Carreidas says the truth about everything but what Rastapopoulos wants him to speak about.
</li></ul></li><li> Minor-league <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> supervillain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingsOfDeath">The Ringer</a> thoroughly subverts this trope. He actually <em>started out</em> working as a legitimate engineer for NASA, but he got a serious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> syndrome when he saw wealthy business executives like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Kyle Richmond</a> getting rich off the hard work of people like him. The Ringer originally embarked on his career to get revenge for the little guy by robbing Kyle Richmond, who was secretly the superhero Nighthawk. After Nighthawk defeated him and he escaped from jail, the Ringer tried again with an upgraded battlesuit that allowed him to gather condensed air particulates and assemble them into a substance that was almost as strong as steel and that he could use to make additional rings whenever he needed them. Despite the fact that this invention could probably have revolutionized the steel industry, to say nothing of manufacturing in general, the Ringer simply uses it to... try and market the battlesuit to his criminal contacts, but then the Beetle forces him to fight Spider-Man and he gets his ass kicked.
</li><li> Another minor league supervillain, the Water Wizard, originally got the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">control water</a> after a freak accident, but simply couldn't figure out what to do with it. It was only after a friend of his suggested he use his powers for crime that he became a supervillain, although he turned out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">utter washout</a> as a supervillain. He improved somewhat after changing his codename to Aqueduct, but not by much.
</li><li> Happens rather often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character is the best thief in the world thanks to his abilities as acrobat, martial artist, chemist, engineer, detective and pilot. He could make a legitimate fortune with any of those professions, or simply patent his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">perfect masks</a> and enjoy the royalties (the request for these is actually a plot point, as nobody but him can make masks that don't break down and melt after a few hours), but he doesn't care. It went to the point that one of his heists involved him creating two <em>Diabolik-proof safes</em> (once Ginko found and removed the devices that read the combination (thus allowing the heist), the safes were impregnable even to Diabolik. Too bad he found out <em>after</em> the caper...).
</li><li> Eva Kant, Diabolik's lover and accomplice, is almost as good as him as an acrobat, martial artist, detective and pilot, and is also decent as a mechanic and a very good singer (in fact she <em>did</em> work as a singer for a while), but she steals because she's in love with Diabolik and wants to help him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> with Suanda: he <em>did</em> try and become legitimately rich with his first inventions, but he was black and white colleagues stole the credit, hence why he became a criminal and joined King's organization.
</li><li> Two other members of King's organization, Wolf and Prof, <em>did</em> become rich using the skills that once made them so valuable for King... But the former was obsessed by Diabolik's masks (it was <em>his</em> project originally) and the latter was greedy as hell, hence why they continued committing crimes on the side.
</li><li> Walter Dorian and others are/were legitimately skilled businessmen-who steal, scam, and generally commit crimes because of greed.
</li><li> Giorgio Corbett tried to become rich with his invention, a device that could <em>detect Diabolik's masks</em>, but first he had the bad luck of getting arrested for industrial espionage before he could tell his employer that he had discovered one of the elements of Diabolik's masks (what could allow the creation of the device), and when, after serving his sentence, he did try to use the device to become rich he choose to sell his invention to a rich private detective who wanted the police's trust instead of selling it directly to the police, leading to Diabolik escaping and murdering him.
<ul><li> Giorgio's nephew Giacomo later found the blueprints, but simply <em>gave</em> the device to the police: he wanted to clear his uncle's name, not money. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A good thing, given that the blueprints were a fake planted by Diabolik for one of his capers.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The villains of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse">Mickey Mouse Comic Universe</a> regularly menace the world using invisibility cloaks, cloning machines, mind-control rays etc., but you shouldn't expect anyone to point out that their inventions are a revolutionary miracle of science that, by all logic, should have changed civilization as we know it years ago.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Invincible">Invincible</a> once ran into a guy who'd invented a "gravity gun" in his basement and used it to rob a bank. He had considered selling his invention, but he needed the money <em>now</em> and that sounded like a long and complicated process. He is really bad at being a supervillain, and Mark lets him go (and returns the money back to the bank) with the advice that he should just sell the technology. In next issue it turns out that he sold the gun... to a bank robber. He didn't know who to see or call about this stuff. After capturing the second robber, Mark takes the guy to Cecil, the head of a super-secret government agency responsible for handling superheroes and supervillains, who gives him a very high-paying job to invent new weapons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a> villain Arcade is a hitman who disposes of victims by dropping them into ridiculously elaborate, carnival themed deathtraps he calls Murderworlds. Arcade charges a million dollars per victim, which doesn't come close to covering his expenses. However, Arcade also happens to be one of the wealthiest men on the planet, so doesn't need the money-he just does what he does because he's a psychopath that enjoys the misery he puts people through in his Murderworlds far more than the money he'd get killing them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Justice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Justice">Justice</a></em> demonstrates and deconstructs this trope. As part of their latest scheme, the Legion of Doom pretend to go straight and use their technology and powers to help people instead of committing crimes. Brainiac uses his city-shrinking tech to build cheap paradise cities where nobody has to work, Scarecrow uses his chemistry knowledge to make miracle cures and elixirs, Toyman uses his robotics skills to build artificial limbs for the disabled, Captain Cold uses his cold gun to provide desert communities with abundant water, and more. The results are incredibly profitable and make people love them, but it's all a trick led by Lex Luthor and Brainiac. Why didn't they just take the money and popularity? Because they're egotistical, self-centered jerks who either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">refuse to acknowledge that altruism can help them</a> or are using their enemies to try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">excuse away their shitty personalities</a>.
</li><li> D-list DC villain Sonar is an interesting case of this, as he was never after money in the first place. He became a supervillain in pursuit of his main goal to make his tiny native country of Modora famous, and invented and built several sound-based devices to commit crimes in order to accomplish this, capable of mental manipulation, ranged sonic attacks, lifting massive objects, and even independent flight. However, he never gets the idea that he could make his country famous and himself massively rich simply selling the technology, or better yet, giving it to the government of his homeland to turn it into a high-tech paradise, never realizing how fleeting his own exploits are and how it makes his own country look bad, if anything, compared to the country having actual value to the world. One has to imagine "home of that guy Green Lantern beats up once a month" isn't going to bring in many tourists.
</li><li> The Prowler, a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> enemy turned friend is yet another subversion. Hobie Brown worked as a window cleaner and used his engineering talents to create special equipment to make his job safer. He hoped to make money legally with his inventions, but mistreatment from his racist boss turned him into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan">Angry Black Man</a> who modifies his gear to use it for crime as the Prowler. He's confronted by Spider-Man, who convinces him to give up crime. After his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, Hobie continues using the Prowler identity and equipment as a superhero, assisting Spider-Man several times. He even uses his Prowler gear to make money as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">superhero for hire</a>, working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSable">Silver Sable</a>, and as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeCopycat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeCopycat">Costume Copycat</a> and bodyguard for Peter Parker.
</li><li> Fabian Stankowicz is a particularly hilarious subversion. Stankowicz was an ordinary guy who became a multimillionaire after winning the lottery. Having a lot of engineering smarts but not a lot of common sense, Stankowicz decides that the only natural thing to do with his fortune is...build an army of killer robots and try to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>. He turned out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a>, to the point that many heroes even didn't think him worth fighting. His lowest point was arguably when he was defeated by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman">David Letterman</a></em>. Note that Letterman was a middle-aged talk show host with no superpowers or combat training.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> has Jason Fox, who tries several ludicrous schemes to make money, (including thousand-dollar SNOW DINOSAURS, which, you know, would MELT come Spring!) despite the fact that he has effortlessly built machines and coded programs that could have made him MILLIONS had he simply sold them. He once tried to form a one-man corporation, but all he had to show investors was "a dinky little program I wrote for fun." Unfortunately for him and them, the Darth Jason virus did not "kill off interest," it "killed off the Internet." Possibly justified in that, while genius at some things, Jason is still a child and thus doesn't always have the best common sense.
<ul><li> That, and Jason cares more about making mischief than money. If the thought ever occurs to him to make money off of the things he produces, it's only so he can buy materials needed to cause greater mischief. For instance, he sent a computer worm directly to the White House, easily bypassing all security, solely to mess with his older sister (which is his most common motivating factor).

Starting your own business is no guarantee of success either, particularly when many businesses fail within their first year of operation. Then there's the fact that many supervillains do <em>not</em> want to spend their time working for people they view as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy Haired Bosses</a> who got ahead through asskissing and brownnosing, rather than actual talent.

The first thing he does once he gets the magical book is steal the Krabby Patty recipe so he can make money off of it rather than just make himself rich. Possibly justified by the fact that it is implied that the book is limited to influencing what has already been written in it, meaning Burger Beard can't do anything directly for himself with it.
</li><li> The villain of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up">Up</a></em>, Charles F. Muntz, wants to get fame and recognition by catching a rare bird. To accomplish this he invents devices that <em>allow dogs to communicate verbally, and fly airplanes.</em> Even if he wanted fame and renown rather than money, being known as the person who invented the device that lets dogs talk to humans would be far more likely to make him famous than catching a new species of bird. Considering the dogs don't even need to bark to speak with this, the profits from engineering it to allow mute humans and humans who are completely paralyzed to speak would ensure his honor among the greats. This is, however, justified and lampshaded to some extent by showing that he has become psychotically obsessed with the bird. His museum is full of dozens of skeletons of other species, all of them of a bizarre nature and undiscovered to science. Had he brought any of those back instead, he would have made far more of a profit in the scientific realm than the capture of a single colorful ostrich.
<ul><li> He was mostly bitter that the one he brought back as a skeleton was declared a fake and obsessed with clearing his name. If he hadn't taken it with him and spent decades hiding in the jungle DNA tests would have proved it long before the time of the movie.

Vanko retorts that his motives are personal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vanko's father <em>did</em> try to sell it for massive profit but Howard Stark would have none of it, exiling him from the US instead.

Angiers could become the richest man in the world almost overnight by copying valuable objects with the machine, but he's already a wealthy gentleman who is more interested in magic than riches. He could also do things like completely end world hunger by copying food and so forth, but his obsession to out-do his magical rival blinds him to all other goals</span>.

The financial rewards for marketing this would be so unimaginably vast that any power the supervillain desired would be easily gained legally. So obviously it's used in a zany evil scheme instead. Semi-justified, as trying to take over the world with an entire generation of superheroes turned into loyal, amoral minions was probably more tempting. Also justified in that the device blew up and reverted <em>her</em> to infancy during its initial field test (because the superhero she was aiming it at punched it while it was charging up), and she has to steal the original prototype back from the hero's trophy room before she can use it again (thus strongly implying that she's unable to make copies of it &mdash; apparently it runs on unique phlebotinum that is not mass-producible).

But the creators must have forgotten that they were able to create an entirely artificial <em>biome</em>, with weather you can control with a <em>touchscreen</em>, bodies of water, soil and plant life, air, and housing. There are tons of applications for all that. Wealthy areas with water shortages, like California, Saudi Arabia, and Israel would pay through the nose for such environments. There would be people who could build their own separate self-sustaining communities. You could colonize Antarctica, or possibly space. And if a TV studio can afford it, you know similar sized groups and national governments can afford these.

Assuming this isn't common tech in the world of the film, this basically breaks a hole in how radiation science works, and even the intended use of it in the movie (clearing out irradiated areas) could be worth billions. They use it to rob Chernobyl.

</li><li> In the Paul Jennings short story <em>The Strap Box Flier</em>, an inventor goes from town to town selling his amazing glue which, in demonstrations, bonds instantly with a grip like steel. He then gets as far away as possible, before the townsfolk figure out the glue comes undone after four hours. Apparently it never occurred to him that a glue which allowed you to fix something immovably into place for a predictable amount of time, after which it would come undone of its own accord, would be worth an incredible fortune.

Dashel Jameson, Sheriff of Krondor, renounces his noble titles and becomes the Upright Man, leader of the Krondorian Thieves Guild, succeeding his late great-uncle, Lyle Rigger. His new second-in-command asks him why he's doing this, since as the son of a Duke and the younger brother of an Earl, there's no way he could make as much money as a thief as he could legitimately. He did it as a point of honor: he had promised a thief he had fallen in love with who had died protecting the city from Keshian raiders that he would look out for the thieves.

There is so much money to be made legitimately by running a Las Vegas casino that he sees no reason to engage in small time crimes anymore.

The big reason is that supervillains, by and large, <strong>aren't</strong> evil people. They vary from paragons of morality to more grey, but the truly evil who get demon powers generally don't throw on a mask and cape and threaten to melt the ice caps with their Doom Ray when more mundane acts of cruelty and corruption tend to work far better &mdash; supervillainy is largely a "show" put on to keep the demon entertained enough that it doesn't force the issue while doing relatively little actual harm. There's also some severe limitations on demon-powered technology that make mass-producing and selling it problematic: the demon can permanently shut it down any time they want, it's relatively fragile, and it only lasts as long as the Hellbinder remains alive with both components bound &mdash; if the demon is exorcised, the human taken to hell, or if the Hellbinder dies, it just stops working.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a> often possess skills that would allow them to make enormous amounts of money very quickly, whether by legitimate or illegitimate means.

This makes criminal work a lot more appealing to some Exalted, since it involves people asking a lot fewer questions.
<ul><li> Of particular note are the Infernal Exalted, servants of the Yozis.

Unfortunately, Ryan's disillusionment with the rest of the world means that all foreign transportation becomes illegal. It's implied that the REAL reason behind Rapture's fall isn't because of a designer gene-drug that slowly erodes your humanity, but because the Rapture economy and technological progress isn't shared with the outside world, and commodities that you can't get/produce in Rapture (such as the sun and the Bible) help create a black market with a very destructive monopoly.

However, they're also shown to be quite well off, suggesting their piracy has been quite lucrative for them at least until they borrowed money from a <em>really</em> corrupt loan shark in <em>The Misadventures of Tron Bonne</em> and later ran afoul of Mega Man Trigger.
</li><li> They've also been shown to repeatedly use legitimate means to earn money as well.

Of course, even if he doesn't want to sell his inventions, he also shows a fondness for casino and theme park designs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">and could probably gain a lot of money and influence just by entertaining people</a>. In several games, he's also uncovered evidence of multiple ancient, extraterrestrial, trans-dimensional artifacts, beings, and civilizations. Evidence of these, as well as the corresponding research, would revolutionize the world, exonerate him and his grandfather multiple times over, herald him as pioneer in science, history, among other fields, and essentially hand him the world on a silver platter!
<ul><li> Granted, given the events of Sonic Adventure 2, it's implied that he wants less exoneration and more payback. Additionally, earlier interpretations has him believe that because he's such a genius, he should be the one running the world. The other problem is that he believes in progress at <em>any</em> cost... as seen in how he ravages the environment for his resources, a common theme in the series since its inception.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>, E-123 Omega sometimes makes references to Dr. Eggman's "consumer models."

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle">Sonic Battle</a></em> Rouge outright states that Eggman sells generic versions of his E-100 Series models as security droids.

The sequel, Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, it's revealed that the security company Meteor Tech which, while having an ulterior motive in the end, did seem to legitimately provide security services for Future City and the rest of the continent it resides on. Eggman also makes an offhand mention to how him selling his technology helps pay for his schemes to defeat Sonic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em>, he manages to grab several planets, build amusement parks and rides on them, and tethers them to the Earth with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator">Space Elevator</a> without affecting any planet's gravity. He broke so many rules of physics with the stunt alone, and the 3DS version implies it is a really fun park (in the Wii version, Sonic snuck his way in there the day before it opened.)

If Shepard chooses to expose what he's doing to the casino owner, Schells despairs at what he's going to do from now on. Shepard's team will point out that with his obvious talents, landing a well-paying job as a programmer or engineer shouldn't be too difficult for him. He scoffs at this.

However, because he had no idea how to actually manage all of it, he unknowingly sold his controlling shares for a few bucks and a high five and is only kept on as a mascot. Torgue himself also expressed interest in hiring Tiny Tina while he still had the company, whom he not only jives with but also sees the potential in the little bombmaker. Also averted with the fact that Torgue, despite his bombastic persona, is rather forward thinking and generally a pretty nice guy whenever he interacts with the Vault Hunters or their acquaintances.

And the animatronics still work after being used as suits. Even after they're effectively dismantled and shoved into different areas of the suit, which is some pretty damn impressive technology considering the suit's no larger than the average animatronic (so where do the pieces go when a human's inside?). This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in this case, however, thanks to the suits being <em>ludicrously</em> unsafe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(as Springtrap can attest to)</span> and Fazbear Entertainment retiring them after multiple failures.

His species <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">values crime and roguery</a>, so a lucrative but secure job is far less appealing to him than a memorable con.
</li><li> The police chief tries to invoke this on Sam, with slightly different point: he points out that Sam commits crimes for the challenge, but catching crooks is even more of a challenge. Doesn't work, alas.

The Kalufraxians prove extremely adept with the matter constructors, solving most of their problems with sophisticated engineering skill. The remaining problems end up killing millions; rather than join in the post-scarcity civilization, the Oligarchy "freaks out" and attempts to murder everyone involved using the privatized militaries of the world. Why? Because they would rather control a starving world than let everyone be happy. Their rivals, an Islamic-parody, also induce slaughter by sabotaging some of the floating cities with modified replicators, killing even more to satisfy their hatred rather than solve the economic problems that caused said hatred. Also, the disgruntled Kalufraxian who tried to assassinate the protagonist had a stable job and high skill in replicator programming, but was plotting revenge for having his people turned into a glorified (and wealthy) slave caste for replicators.

<div class="indent">I just wanted to include this page to show an example of a super using his powers intelligently. He does present a potential threat, but he&#146;s not breaking any laws. It&#146;s one of those &#147;watch this guy closer than the strong guy making his living in construction, but otherwise live and let live&#148; supers. He could try to threaten cities on fault lines and ransom them for millions with is geokinesis, but he&#146;s not living in a silver age comic book, so why would he? It is something that bothers me about a lot of supervillains. So many of them have powers, or their whole shtick is predicated on a gadget they made that with the tiniest application of intelligence could make them millionaires in the private sector. The Trapster made incredibly strong yet easily sprayable adhesive. The Green Goblin made something the size of an opened pizza box that not only can fly, it can carry the weight of at least two humans plus equipment, and based on some of the fights he&#146;s had with Spider-Man, it&#146;s not exactly short range either. Yes, the usual excuse is that most bad guys are a little bit crazy, but then consider this. The first time Spidey beats the Goblin, there&#146;s this flying thing just sitting there. It&#146;s not like the crazy bad guy filed a patent for it. Ok, maybe the first version before he went crazy, but Goblin&#146;s been around for a while, and he&#146;s probably upgraded the flyer, and post crazy, he&#146;s probably not keeping up with the patent process. Somebody would take that thing apart, file their own patents, and boom. Delivery drones, extreme sports gliders, hoverboards, military hovering sniper platforms, whatever. Someone would do something constructive with it. That&#146;s why I&#146;m careful not to throw a lot of gadgeteers into the world, because it would cause an irreversible tech spiral, and the comic world would diverge dramatically from our own.

Plenty of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a> do, in fact, patent their inventions, and figure out uses for them.

And this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">mercilessly lampshaded</a> by Ayla Goodkind herself, when she complains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool">Whateley Academy</a> needs better contract law help for these inventors, and courses to teach the inventors how not to get robbed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> so they have to turn to crime later in life.
<ul><li> As a rule, those inventors who become supervillains generally <em>don't</em> do so just for money's sake - while some are quite mercenary, there is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> or other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> behind it (often tied the the world's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>) beyond just "I want to be rich, so let's go rob a bank". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceRelatedMemeticDisorder">Diedrick's Syndrome</a> and similar psychological problems also factor into many such cases (e.g., Lady Havoc).

<ul><li> Possibly averted with Insano himself. Although he's bent on world domination and of questionable competence as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>, he mentions once that he does most of his work on Etsy. This implies that he has at least managed to <em>somewhat</em> monetize his inventions. He's also aired advertisements for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> field generators, as well as a cure for a condition that "affects over seven people a year". A crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Atop the Fourth Wall</a></em> reveals that he also sold the government the technology the critics stole from him to turn a house into a working spaceship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToBoldlyFlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToBoldlyFlee">To Boldly Flee</a></em>; he only delayed doing so because he had assumed they wouldn't want something so silly.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, this trope is played with. While there exists a subset of parahumans called "rogues" who turn their attention entirely to legal ventures with their powers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Tinkers</a> almost always end up as either heroes or villains, being as (a) the alternative is being coerced into producing equipment for heroes or villains and (b) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Tinker equipment isn't generally fit for mass production.</a>
<ul><li> The trope's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a> in that there is an entire body of law more or less dedicated to making it difficult for parahumans to legally use their powers for any kind of productive purpose. Its ostensible function is to prevent unfair competition, its semi-secret function is to force those parahumans to join the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard">Protectorate</a>, and its <em>extremely</em> secret purpose is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to force parahumans to use their powers in ways that will cause conflict and destruction, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">triggering</a> more parahumans in order to have as large an army as possible for the final battle against Zion</span>.

It almost works for him... but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">the compulsion to outwit Batman</a> is too great, and he decides that the only way he could enjoy his new life is to lure Batman into a death trap and get rid of him altogether. Unfortunately, this doesn't work, and Riddler goes back to prison.
<ul><li> Notably, Nygma had a similar motivation as Fugate starting out - he was initially a software engineer who developed a smash hit title, but his boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealingTheCredit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealingTheCredit">took credit for making it</a> and unceremoniously fired Edward, asking "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?</a>" and prompting Nygma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>.

</li><li> Zig-zagged with this version of Spellbinder, a psychologist who uses sophisticated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> devices to hypnotize people into stealing for him. Aside from the fact that he's invented all this hypnotic equipment but can't think of anything better to do with it than trick people into stealing for him, he probably doesn't even make a profit on his crimes. However, in his introductory episode Spellbinder goes on a rant which indicates that this may be more about revenge than greed. It took another turn when Spellbinder got wiser and began marketing his equipment as virtual reality generators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">that allowed people to live out their fantasies</a>. He "marketed" it like a drug pusher and got taken down by Batman for it. It's unlikely that there would be any actual law against using the tech on willing people itself, but there would be for coercing other people especially minors into committing crimes for him.
</li><li> Inverted with Shriek, was a brilliant, yet impractical engineer who specialized in sonics. For his market debut, he developed a suit that could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">generate and direct sound waves</a> for demolition purposes. However, his boss, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> Derek Powers, had the reaction upon seeing the suit in action of "dynamite's cheaper" &mdash; his invention isn't practical and <em>couldn't</em> turn a profit if put on the market, the validity of Powers' claim is unknown as the actual costs of creating and using the suit aren't shown to the viewers. He promised Shriek to continue funding his experiments if he took care of Batman instead. Shriek is later seen to have invented some astonishing devices that would rake in millions, such as a gadget that selectively blocks loud noises (imagine the applications if you live near a construction site), but his boss still forces him to act as a personal killing machine. Afterward, Shriek becomes deaf and thus somehow invents a device that appears similar to headphones that can reverse deafness for as long as it's worn by the person, but by this point he's too obsessed with getting revenge on Batman to care about making money.
</li><li> Played with in "The Winning Edge". Unlike Bane, who only used Venom for himself to commit crimes, Chappell manages to convert Venom into an easily usable dermal patch that he begins marketing as a performance-enhancing drug to teenagers. However, he still does this illegally through black market means, presumably because it's unlikely a Venom-based compound would ever be made legal.
</li><li> In another episode, a talented weapons designer loses his high-paying job at a defense contractor. It's heavily implied that although he could easily find another job, it wouldn't bring in as much money as he and his family had grown accustomed to having. Instead, he goes into business as a corporate mercenary/saboteur, which apparently pays pretty well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">in Gotham</a>.

Unfortunately, his co-worker and the girl he liked would end up sabotaging it in front of their first potential investors and him taking the fall (according to her, she found him unstable due to him losing his temper at a condescending investor who reminded him of his abusive dad.) Riddler does not take it well when Batman spells it out for him (Riddler assuming it was the businessman who did it.) This leads Eddie going on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> in becoming Riddler.

Dr. Blight, for example, can invent a time machine, but her best plan for making money with it is to <em>sell a nuke to Hitler.</em> Dr. Blight did occasionally work directly for other villains for money, such as in the episode on overpopulation where she invented a duplicator ray for Looten Plunder (so that he could use it to clone an Indonesian child laborer ad infinitum to have endless dirt-cheap factory labor). Averted, however, with Sly Sludge, who eventually <em>does</em> go legit after being told recycling could be just as profitable as his usual poaching/polluting gigs (in real life, this is only true for metals). Hoggish Greedly ended up doing the same thing, applying his savvy for get-rich-quick schemes in a more legitimate and eco-friendly direction in the last season.

<ul><li> Oddly, sometimes he <em>tries</em> to sell his inventions honestly, but hits an unexpected snag that turns him dishonest use out of spite. In one episode he has built a lightning generator whose power supply is the static electricity you get from rubbing several hundred fuzzy cats. In his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a>, he claims to have tried selling it to a power company, but the design was so silly that they wouldn't take him seriously.

</li><li> Liquidator is an infuriating example. His entire character is the acquisition of money and the greed for it. Yet he has shown that his skills as a manipulator of water could grant him infinite money. He can instantly purify water ("Life, The Negaverse, and Everything"), an ability he could use to decontaminate fetid or salt water and make money by selling it. Most egregiously, he can instantly bring water to a boiling point with no external heat source ("Dry Hard"). You know what runs off steam? Electric turbines! He could create a source of clean and green energy that companies would pay hand over fist for. That's not taking into account the fact that he can apparently generate water from no external source ("Just Us Justice Ducks"). Can you say hydroelectric power? So many LEGAL opportunities, and all much better than flooding a city and selling the survivors rubber rafts.

<ul><li> The Beagle Boys Inc. from the Scrooge McDuck universe have moments of clarity: in one story, they realize that at their rate of success, they make an average 14 cents per hour. In another story, they open an ice cream parlor as a front to plan a bank robbery, and to their own surprise make good honest money with it. Subverted because they don't go straight.
</li><li> A doubly subversive episode has them realizing they have musical talent. Ma Beagle signs them in a record deal under Scrooge's label as part of a plan to rob the Money Bin. However, the Boys find their new lifestyle extremely profitable... even Scrooge is making money off of them, despite their excessive demands, so they go legit. However, Ma Beagle runs them ragged with concerts, personal appearances, etc. that they fire her as their agent, which causes her to ruin them for revenge so they'd have to go back to being criminals, and thus unable to make money without her getting a cut of it.

He dreams big and savors fleecing the kids from their money, but from the effort he, Ed and Double D make, they could make more money legitimately through things like mowing lawns and not infer the wrath of the Cul-De-Sac (though <em>technically</em> he did do that by using his dad's special growth mulch and growing the lawns to massive size and planning to charge everyone with it, besides Rolf since they rented his goat out.)
<ul><li> This is contrasted with <em>Jimmy</em> of all people. When Sara leaves him in Ed's care, Eddy gets the idea to mentor him in the art of scamming. Jimmy turns out to be a surprisingly innovative and clever at this. He goes for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">Simple, yet Awesome</a> approach, such as making a trampoline out of recycled materials (like used dollies) and then charging the kids for time. In another episode, when Eddy is suffering from a creative lurch, he goes to recruit Jimmy, recalling how he did mentor him. After Jimmy gets the supplies needed, it's revealed his idea are <em>giant popsicles</em> (by giant, we mean they're the size of <em>fridges</em>) to sell. Eddy ends up refusing and thus looks like a fool when Jimmy's idea works. Overall, Jimmy's approach is not only more honest, but more effective.
</li><li> However, over time, it becomes clear that his goal isn't exactly the money, but "respect". Specifically, the "respect" he interpreted his older brother (who was his role model and mentor in scamming) got when they were young as he ruled the neighborhood, being feared/admired by everyone. He becomes more desperate as time goes by, which culminates in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>.

<ul><li> The Misfits are a genuinely successful and popular music group in their own right, just not <em>quite</em> as successful as Jem and the Holograms. Their efforts to one-up and sabotage Jem generally only succeed in making themselves look bad; if they weren't so fixated on outdoing Jem and the Holograms and focused on their own performances, they'd have nothing to complain about. This is shown with particular clarity in the three-part "Starbright" episode; they manage to buy their way into and eventually take over the movie production that Jem had won the contract for in a previous episode, and their constant efforts to harass and sabotage Jem and the Holograms eventually drive the latter off the film - along with everyone else competent associated with the production, all of whom join Jem in shooting the original script. The Misfits' film is an unwatchable mess that went severely over its already multi-million-dollar budget only to crash and burn at the box office, no doubt resulting in their popularity taking a hit; they could have profited in both money and popularity if they'd simply spent the time touring instead, especially since Jem couldn't schedule any performances during the shooting of the movie.
</li><li> It also goes for their manager Eric Raymond. It costs him a fortune just to keep the Misfits out of trouble and he'd be better off promoting a group that was less trouble...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">which he eventually does in the final episodes of the series.</a>

<ul><li> The Beekeeper would play this straight in his final episode. The premise has Johnny trying to come up with candy-based holiday in the summer (lamenting the gap between Easter and Halloween) and meeting with failure (mixed reception on delivery mascots, harassed by the Easter Bunny's legal reps over chocolate usage, the artificiality of candy, etc). All while the Beekeeper keeps trying to get his vengeance. Eventually, Johnny realizes that Beekeeper meets all those critrea needed with his all-natural honey bars and swarms of bees.

If their closing lines are any indication, they screw up similarly in every town they pass through. There is also the possibility of them using the technology behind the titular cider machine and adapting it into transport vehicles to be mass produced and sold. Even if it does require a unicorn's magic to run, it's <em>still</em> worlds more advanced than any other vehicle shown in the series. They also never consider the possibility that the technology behind it could be easily adapted to run almost all of the manually (hoofually?) operated machinery shown in the world. A possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> shown in the Season 5 finale hints that if the two ever got their act together (and the Mane Six weren't around to stop them) they'd be <em>ruling Equestria</em> instead of a pair of failed hucksters.

The problem with this is two-fold: apple juice mixed with beet greens would be rather healthy and taste quite good, <em>especially</em> to horses, so they could have marketed it legitimately as a mundane health drink and easily made just as much money. Alternately, magic cure-all potions <em>actually exist in Equestria</em> and are apparently quite easy to make, meaning there was nothing really stopping them from making and selling potions that actually worked. Hell, they could have done both and actually made a good-tasting health drink that actually cured ailments and been rolling in money if they were willing to put in a bit extra brain-power and work.

Hell, Twilight's diary listing all of their friendship lessons <em>is commercially available to the public</em> for them to glean lessons from, without having to "steal" anything. Failing that, they could have started a legitimate school that taught magical theory or technological theory owing tho their apparently legitimate talent in building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> vehicles and gotten EEA approval fair and square. Again, they could have even done both; really their problem is their shortsightedness and impatience when it comes to getting rich.
</li><li> However, an episode showing them in Las Pegasus pretty much underlines that while profit is their main motive, they get a satisfication over <em>conning</em> ponies so it's less about the money and more that they're such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snakes</a> that like exploiting with other ponies.
</li><li> Queen Chrysalis and her changeling army from the Season 2 Finale are obviously a justified example of this, being in a kids show and all, but let's be honest: a species that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshift into anyone</a> and feeds on the loosely defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">"love" of others</a> wouldn't have much trouble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">using said powers to get their food source a different way</a>. Instead they choose to invade and conquer which, as one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> commentator put it, is like "shooting a cow so you can milk it".
</li><li> The Changelings motives are explored more in Season 6. They <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">need</a></em> the love and it's generally not a pleasant experience, as seen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">good Changeling Thorax</a>. Then, in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Season 6 finale, we find out Chrysalis has kidnapped nearly anypony that could thwart her plans and she wishes for her Changelings to bring her the ponies... so <em>she</em> can grow more powerful.

When Thorax realizes this, he shares love and becomes new King, with all the Changelings following suit, except for her (and as later shown, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">Aloof Big Brother</a> Pharynx who's more of a mix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Good Old Ways</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a> than evil and even he gets on board) All of the Changelings' motives boiled down to being in perpetual starvation and just wanting to stop being hungry; Chrysalis, though, wanted power and manipulated her people just so she can get more powerful and rule over Equestria. It ends with Starlight triumphing over her, the Changelings redeemed under Thorax, and Chrysalis on the run, her subjects and kingdom gone</span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In season 8, it's explored in even more depth. As the leader of the good Changelings, Thorax is a semi-competent diplomat and the Changelings are slowly becoming more respected as the other races gradually see they're no longer a threat. Through legitimate means, Thorax is now becoming welcomed in Celestia's court as a ruling power, friends with the current <em>Dragon Lord</em>, and letting Ocellus join Twilight's School of Friendship as a representative of sorts. Chrysalis, meanwhile, is already psychopathic and probably going insane, and there's very little chance she'll understand friendship. Given she was already pretty bad before the switch, the legitimate way of gaining the power Thorax has now probably never entered her mind. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a> sees her releasing the windigos so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProtectionRacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProtectionRacket">she can destroy them, "save" the ponies, and they'll love her out of gratitude</a>: she's at least on the right track, but it's still never occurred to her that, given the nature and extent of her powers and Equestria's tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">easily forgive even the most vile villains in a heartbeat</a> if their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> is genuine (such a forgiveness was handed to her, she turned it down out of spite), she'd have a much easier and more successful time getting the masses to adore her if she just dropped the villainy and used her powers for good.</span>

Sure, Perry eventually escapes, but he's a secret agent. If Doof would just start a security company or consulting agency to capture run-of-the-mill criminals, he could <em>buy</em> the Tri-State area. This may not be that good of an indication of quality since, well, it's Perry; several episodes showed Perry willingly walking into a trap just to get their current battle back on script. After a while he just gave Perry a key to his lab to save money on busted-in doors.
</li><li> It varies between episodes if this applies to the title characters or not. While in some episodes they'll just give away things like sports arenas and entire theme parks, other episodes included them launching business ventures that saw massive success (until they got bored of them and walked away) or charging admission to shows that filled stadiums.

Other Ricks in alternate universes, who are less unstable than our Rick, really have built some impressive empires and, hilariously enough, our Rick even envies some of them such as wishing he was the one to come up with the <em>incredibly</em> lucrative daycare service for Jerries.

In short, the reason villains don't just use their powers to make money legally is that they're either already rich or completely bonkers&mdash;without being one or both, they wouldn't be able to be supervillains in the first place.
<ul><li> One of the few aversions is Doctor Salazar, otherwise known as Bugaboo. He invented a process that induced genetic mutations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessorGuineaPig">but turned himself into a beetle-man in the process</a>. He then used his powers to steal rare chemicals... so that he could turn himself back. Once he'd perfected the formula, he used it on himself, and left his life of crime behind to apply the formula to reverse other mutations, now being considered one of the world's foremost experts.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em>, Dick Dastardly's Mean Machine is obviously the fastest car in the races and he <em>always</em> manages to get ahead of everyone else. If he wasn't so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">adamant in cheating</a> and causing the other racers to get <em>further</em> behind of his considerable lead, he could have easily won every single race. Given a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in the new <em>Wacky Races</em> pilot where he tells Muttley that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">as villains they have to cheat</a>. They were three feet from the finish line and napping for an indeterminate time beforehand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Butcher has the power to produce seemingly-infinite meat from his hands, but rarely seems to use this power to actually <em>sell</em> meat, despite the fact that he could do it at unbeatable prices with every cent being profit. He actually tried to once in "Meat-life Crisis" only for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> to try and screw him over leading to The Butcher returning to crime by robbing him.
</li><li> Likewise Dr. Two-Brains and Tobey never seem to think of using their genius engineering skills to a more profitable use than stealing cheese and throwing annoyed fits, respectively. This might be excused by the fact that Two-Brains has his brain fused with that of a mouse, and Tobey is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a>. Neither situation gives a person top-notch reasoning skills.
</li><li> Two-Brains doesn't <em>always</em> steal cheese. Sometimes he steals other things with the intention of turning them <em>into</em> cheese. Things like <em>gold</em>. Forget making more money legitimately, he could have made a lot of money illegitimately, but he just wanted to turn it into cheese. His henchmen asked if they could maybe have some of the gold for themselves before he turned it into cheese and he berated them for it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Idiosyncrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Idiosyncrazy">gold is not their gimmick, cheese is</a>. Even if all he wanted was cheese, how much cheese can you buy with a single gold bar? A hell of a lot more than a single gold-bar-sized block of cheese, that's for sure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">While not as skilled as the above three</a>, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy has attempted a legitimate job in no less than three episodes: "Chuck the Nice Pencil Selling Guy", "Chuck Makes a Buck" and "Lunchlady Chuck", only to go back to crime at the end due to some small slight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em>: Zigzagged with the Zeta Project scientists. In the first place they were building a weapon for the government rather than any supervillain. But played straight in that once the project was complete several of them (Arroyo, Boyle and Myrell) left government service in order to use the kind of technological innovations they&#146;d built Zeta with for more widely accessible and beneficial science (Industrial robotics, a space probe and technology to cure disabled children respectively). That being said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Boyle</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Myrell</span> both have trouble funding that peaceful research and commit some criminal act to rectify that.
