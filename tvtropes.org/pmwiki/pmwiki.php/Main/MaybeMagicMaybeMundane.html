Or some magical things may be clearly magical, and others more ambiguous. Conversely, the presence of high technology or other <em>non</em>-magical special powers extends the possibilities of this trope by allowing a greater range of "mundane" phenomena. It can also effectively come into play when characters ponder whether an effect was natural or extremely high tech.

Both Osaka and Sakaki dream of her father being a "cat creature" which is also encountered in the waking world as a stuffed animal. When scenes are shown of Chiyo interacting with her family, her parents are neither seen nor heard (Chiyo's lines to them are typically the sort of declarative statement that would not require a response, and the scenes end before they would have time to speak). Thus, while one possibility is that she has parents like the other girls who just never appear on-camera, there are also the distinct possibilities that her parents are imaginary or that her father is, in fact, the cat-creature.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, the Hellhound entity that resides within Guts. Its presence being hinted in the early Black Swordsman Arc and having a full physical debut in the Lost Children Arc, fans speculate <em>what</em> the Hellhound is and <em>where</em> it exactly came from. Is it an independent spirit that latched onto Guts during the Eclipse event, or is it merely a trauma-induced hallucination spurred by the traumatic Eclipse? Is the Beast a separate and malevolent force that has always resided within Guts since birth, or is the Beast in fact <em>Guts himself</em> and is just an anthropomorphization of his darker nature? As the setting of <em>Berserk</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> in full effect, it <strong>could</strong> have started out as an abstract idea but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa">took a life of its own through Guts' constant contact with the supernatural world</a>. We just don't know what the Hellhound is and might never know.
</li><li> Ryou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BokuraNoHentai">Bokura no Hentai</a></em> can see his dead sister's ghost. It's left ambiguous whether she's real or not <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it's implied he's hallucinating it and it's his subconscious</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the manga's final chapter, it's noted that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikami mysteriously died in prison ten days after Light's defeat, leading Matsuda to theorize that Near wrote in the Death Note so as to restrict Mikami's actions, enabling Light's conviction. The anime includes no such speculation from Matsuda, and Mikami instead commits suicide on the spot, casting doubt on a supernatural interpretation</span>.
</li><li> Then, there was that part where Light's archenemy L appeared during his death, both staring at each other and lampshading L's own death. This almost drove fans insane with their theories, riots and flame wars. Although the author has made it quite clear that the afterlife doesn't exist in the <em>Death Note</em> mythos,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0r315');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0r315" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0r315');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the manga, when Ryuk tells Light not to think a human who's used a Death Note is able to go to Heaven or Hell, Light correctly deduces that he actually means there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">no afterlife for anyone</a>, which Ryuk confirms - though this is omitted in the anime.</span> there is still speculation that it wasn't Light's hallucination but L actually staring at him supernaturally.
</li><li> The notebook itself is a subject of debate. Does it contain some sort of sentience that can actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">bring out the worst in people's egos</a>, or is it just an (extra)ordinary notebook?
</li></ul></li><li> The main point of Miki Yoshikawa's one-shot <em>The Demon's Classroom</em>. An elementary school class gets a new teacher who claims to be Diablo de Mon, the former king of the underworld. At first, he acts quite weird and seems oblivious to the customs of human society, making the kids think he really <em>is</em> a demon. When they decide to try and bust him as a demon, they are unsuccessful as now he acts like a normal human. By accident, they set fire to his house, and the next morning, the house is whole, and de Mon himself is unharmed. He claims he used his powers to nullify the fact that the fire took place. Then the main character notices that he has burns on his hands. At the end of the story, the narration states that the kids grew to like de Mon, but never actually found out if his claims were true.

However, <em>it could not explain</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicLink">Psychic Link</a> Ame has with Juun.
</li><li> This trope is a major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GroundControlToPsychoelectricGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GroundControlToPsychoelectricGirl">Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl</a></em>. The title character, Erio Touwa, believes she's an alien and eventually secludes herself from almost all human contact. Then her cousin Makoto Niwa moves in due to his parents having to work outside of Japan, and he brings her back to reality. She slowly starts to reintegrate into human society, and then a strange girl named Yashiro Hoshimiya appears and berates him for causing her to stop believing in aliens. He constantly ridicules her as well, thinking she's got the same psychological issues Erio went through. At the end of episode 13, Yashiro tells Makoto to move slightly from the position he's standing in. Shortly after he does, a meteor crashes into the exact spot he was just standing in, causing him to wonder if she really was telling the truth about being an alien.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: The Ultra Divine Water. Korin says that it's magical and can unleash a fighter's latent power. Yajirobe claims that the water is just poison after tasting it. In the anime, the Darkness, the entity who guards the Ultra Divine Water, states that the water is poisonous, but it does bring out a fighter's latent abilities if they can withstand the pain and have latent power to bring out. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Z</a></em>, it appears that the Ultra Divine Water was just really powerful poison since as a Saiyan, Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility">gets stronger from near death</a> and no one before Goku has ever survived drinking the Ultra Divine Water, so we don't know if it can make a human stronger.

Further complicating matters is the fact that when someone tries shooting an unaware Mikitaka with the Stand Arrow, it simply bounces off his body, something that never happened before and never happens again in the entire franchise.

Umika is a painfully shy girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantSpitItOut">with zero communication skills</a> who longs to meet telepathic aliens so she can finally find somebody who understands her. One day, a girl named Yuu Akeuchi enters her classroom claiming to be an alien stuck on Earth with a broken spaceship. She is unable to offer any proof of what she says; she has no memories of her time before "arriving" and only has a travel log written in an alien language that's copied right out of a book Umika also possesses. She also claims she can communicate telepathically just by touching foreheads, but never says anything that can't be deduced from body language and her words are vague enough that Umika may be jumping to conclusions and offering up the details herself. Umika, though, is so desperate to be friends with somebody who understands her that she overlooks the ambiguity and pledges to help Yuu fix her spaceship so they can travel the stars together.

<div class="indent"><strong>Robert Black:</strong> Now, if something supernatural were to actually occur to someone in real life, anyone normal would just run a mile. They wouldn't have the author and reader's interest in unraveling the mystery and getting to the story's end. They'd simply flee. I know I would, and I like to think that I'm a normal person underneath it all. I suppose the only way to handle it realistically is to rely on people's tendency not to believe that anything out of the ordinary is going on, even if evidence is mounting to the contrary.

<ul><li> Is Hobbes a real person, or (as most people around Calvin think) just a stuffed animal subjected to Calvin's vivid imagination? Careful attention reveals that instead of both being possible, <em>neither</em> is: Calvin could hardly tie himself to a chair, for instance, which Hobbes has done to him (on request).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0on4v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0on4v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0on4v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was viewed by Calvin's father, so it's not just Calvin's imagination.</span> On the other hand, photos of Hobbes in action show only a stuffed tiger. The best we're likely to get is the author's comment that "Calvin sees Hobbes one way, and everyone else sees Hobbes another way. I show two versions of reality, and each makes complete sense to the participant who sees it."
</li><li> This comes up with some of Calvin's other apparent fantasies, too. In one series, he creates several duplicates of himself; no one besides him and Hobbes sees more than one Calvin at a time, but his mother seems a bit perplexed at how she keeps finding Calvin in unexpected places. On the opposite side, there are also fantasies that have very mundane solutions that are pointed out, such as when Calvin imagines a baseball coming to life and chewing up his bat, Calvin's father points out the mundane idea that Calvin had been hitting rocks with it, despite Calvin clearly being scared... Interestingly, these scenarios are often juxtaposed with clear fantasies that even Calvin admits aren't real (such as Spaceman Spiff). So why would Calvin be willing to acknowledge that Spiff and Stupendous Man are figments of his imagination, but not that, say, aliens coming to provide him with tree leaves for his report are?

There's also the question of how it can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">Bigger on the Inside</a>, and how he got all the stuff that is supposedly inside it; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">claims have been made by him and other characters</a> that it contains a television, a pool table, a book collection, and even a Van Gogh (which he replaced with an Andrew Wyeth after the dog house was destroyed in a fire).

The general consensus among the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">logical heroes</a> is that the energy from Zatanna's outburst simply restarted Robin's heart and revived him from a clinical death, but some of the magical heroes wonder if, instead of "merely" restarting Robin's heart, Zatanna's powerful magic actually brought him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>.

Notably, the Horseman's horse is the same color as that of Brom Bones, and he also carries a sword identical to that Bones previously wielded. However, Ichabod does at one point look down the Horseman's coat and panics, implying that he doesn't see anything and that what he encountered was the real deal &#150; although since we don't see what he sees inside the coat, he might also have been reacting to seeing a murderous Brom Bones looking up at him. In another scene the Horseman's horse jumps from a hill to another that was quite far from the former, like it was flying. A thing that a normal horse wouldn't have done it.

Likewise, Kristoff is moved into this territory with his song "Lost In The Woods", which hints that he might be (unknowingly) some form of shaman channeling Sven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">instead of him pretending to speak for Sven</a>.

It's possible they're just imaginary friends Quasimodo created to deal with his isolation. In the climax, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">another gargoyle appears to come alive, scares Frollo, and breaks. While it's possible that this was a supernatural occurrence, the gargoyle may have just broken off from Frollo's weight (especially considering he'd accidentally cracked its base with his sword earlier), and it making a face could be explained as Frollo just seeing things, especially since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">wasn't exactly in the best mental health</a> at the time</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDameII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDameII">The sequel</a>, made by different people, apparently reveals they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Real After All</a>, but that last part may have been an unrelated hallucination.
<ul><li> There also several moments in the film that seem to imply that Notre Dame is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">sentient</a>, such as in the beginning of the movie when many of the statues seem to be staring menacingly at Frollo for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">trying to kill baby Quasimodo</a>.

</li><li> The ending of Disney's version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> leaves it ambiguous whether the adventures in Neverland were real or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> of Wendy's. Unlike in the original play and novel, where Wendy and her brothers spend many days in Neverland and come home to find their parents grieving their absence, here the trip lasts just one night, the children are already back home by the time the parents come back from their dinner party, and while they see what looks like the pirate ship sailing in the distant sky, it's purposefully drawn so we can't quite tell if it really is the ship or just a cloud formation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReturnToNeverland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReturnToNeverland">The sequel</a> more or less confirms it to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Real After All</a>, though.

They also move impossibly far in parts of the song when the screen goes dark for an instant, but that could just be musical convention instead of in-universe magic, or they could have employed body doubles. They also apparently summon floating glyphs and control flames with gestures during the same number. Earlier on, their presentation of Tzipporah in tribute to Rameses wouldn't be out of place in a modern magic show, apart from how "the Midian girl" is tied up for real. Them turning water into blood looks more obviously fake, though: they just add some powder that gives it a reddish tint. Of course, the point of the demonstration was to make Moses look like a deceiver. Overall the simplest explanation is that they are pure fakers, but it leaves open the possibility that they have some actual powers as well.

While the movie leans to the former, the fact that Gusteau knows things Remy doesn't and can physically touch him suggest the latter. Interestingly enough, the script doesn't refer to him as a ghost or as a figment of Remy's imagination, only a "sprite". Thus it is up to the viewer what exactly he is.

<ul><li> The visible book text at the beginning states that the Trapper can't remember planning the trip or getting onto the stagecoach, but he knows that it's where he's "supposed to be."
</li><li> The Englishman looks a bit like Mephistopheles, with a narrow mustache and Van Dyke. He describes himself and the Scotsman as "reapers" and "harvesters of souls," saying that he never takes in his quarry alive. With the other passengers' complete attention, he states that his job is to distract their quarry. He adds that as a storyteller, he "lives forever." While staring fixedly at the other passengers, he also says that he likes to watch his quarry as they "negotiate the passage."
</li><li> The Scotsman sings a song about a man who is about it die, which chokes up the Englishman. He sings this song on every trip.
</li><li> The coachmen, who the Englishman says never stops as "policy," never reveals his face, wears black and drives four black horses.
</li><li> The Lady says she's meeting her estranged husband, who has been ill. She also mentions Jacob's Ladder. In the end, the Englishman and the Scotsman carry a body up a flight of stairs with a white light emanating above it.
</li><li> The passengers are all reluctant to exit the stagecoach. After the Trapper and the Lady enter the hotel, the camera lingers on the Frenchman, who hesitates. When he goes into the hotel, the Trapper and the Lady have vanished.
</li><li> The ambiance is very supernatural, with green fog and lightning. Fort Morgan looks eerie and foreboding.
</li><li> In the book page visible at the end, the narrator states that the Trapper has nothing left to say and prepares for a "long quiet."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween1978">Halloween (1978)</a></em> makes it ambiguous whether Michael Myers is just a really tough serial killer or whether he is, in fact, an indestructible Boogeyman. The film allows for either interpretation, though the last scene leans towards the latter.

<ul><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthyColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthyColossus">Phantom 'Mech</a>" ability, which was displayed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse">BattleTech Expanded Universe</a></em> but also given rules in the tabletop during three different scenario sets. In combat, Morgan Kell's, Patrick Kell's and Yorinaga Kurita's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">battlemechs</a> became completely invisible to sensors, and targeting systems were completely unable to detect them. Attempting to fire upon them resulted in the weapon missing entirely, unless they engaged each other, or someone got both fancy and dumb. (Daniel Allard successfully hit Morgan Kell by having his 'Mech's computer fire at the flashes of Morgan's lasers; he said himself this was low-probability to work if Morgan had been moving.) It's never explained what exactly it is; whether it be destiny, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">LosTech</a> stealth system. The fact Morgan was apparently able to do it against the Clans again during the Battle of Luthien argues against it having been lostech, though.
</li><li> The visions that Clan Nova Cat warriors experience fall under this as well. Are they really glimpsing the future, or is it simply hallucinations that are sufficiently vague as to be easy to find an explanation for them? The fact that they're only ever interpreted <em>after</em> events that fulfill them have happened points to the latter, as does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Nova Cats winding up as a Client State for the Draconis Combine that choked them of resources and used them as cannon fodder before ultimately wiping them out during a succession crisis</span>.

Sometimes, just savor the mystery.
</li><li> The Fate systems such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">Dresden RPG</a> and Strands of Fate have the Aspect system where all characters have a set of "Aspects" which basically causes PCs and other important characters to have a serious case of Plot Happens in their general vicinity. Leaving you to wonder in some settings whether there is something special about these people.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> had some fun with this too. Any smart mage makes their spells look like coincidences, hypertech, or something else that the general population believes will work (and a fair number actually believe that this is what is happening). With the heavy levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> used, the odds are very good that there's a bit of both magic and coincidence/super-science/whatever going on.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> sourcebook <em>Asylum</em> presents a suite of odd happenings and disturbed individuals in the ill-starred Bishopsgate Mental Hospital in one chapter. The book gives each of them one or more supernatural explanations... and also gives a mundane one for each, with the "real" answer in the Storyteller's hands. (For example, one of the patients is a woman with foggy memories and terribly-kept medical records. The book gives two possibilities: she's being used as a storage conduit by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">the Seers of the Throne</a>, who alter her records to hide their activities... or she's just an ill woman with an aneurysm on the verge of bursting, and the hospital's just really screwed up keeping their books straight.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> ups the ante on this a bit by giving rogues (the "tricky" non-magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass">Character Class</a>) access to actual spells as class "tricks". Because they're so good at faking it, sometimes even the universe just gives up and believes them.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> loves this trope as a cornerstone of its setting, especially when the Adeptus Mechanicus come into play. Is that ancient relic so powerful because it was created with long-lost technology of astounding power, or is it truly blessed by the Emperor to protect his children? Do the Necrons invoke some strange techno-sorcery in their weapons and vehicles, or is their understanding of the material world so absolute that we can't even begin to understand how they work? Are the Legion of the Damned mystical undead, or just regular marines suffering from some ungodly mixture of the Black Rage and Nurgle Rot? Did the Techpriest's chanting and ritual application of holy oils appease the machine spirit of the Land Raider, or does the Land Raider just have a voice-activated diagnostic program installed? The answer is very, very rarely made clear in any given case. This is made worse because it has to be on a case-by-case basis since magic and super-tech both exist in the setting, and some tech (especially that used by Orks) is explicitly a mix of real mechanical systems and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>.

He's only visible to Elisabeth, Rudolf and Lucheni, none of whom are particularly sane, and Lucheni is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> anyway. In other productions he's more obviously a real character.

But since only Veronica sees them, and she gradually grows more and more unstable, it's left up to the audience to decide if the ghosts are really there or just a hallucination. At one point, the ghosts warn her of danger, but that could also be chalked up to Veronica's gut feeling, especially considering she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> already. Essentially, it's up to you whether the ghosts caused Veronica's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>, or if it was the other way around.

The reprise of "I Am the One" could easily support either conclusion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em>, it's deliberately left ambiguous as to whether the Phantom actually does have supernatural abilities. Some of the things he does, like the mirror, are understandable, but a lot more - causing the piano to play itself during the rehearsal of Don Juan Triumphant, creating fire in the graveyard, making the gates in his lair rise with merely a gesture, disappearing from under his cloak at the end of the show - while obviously stage effects in real life, have no practical explanation in the context of the story. However, the film version makes it very clear that all the stunts he pulls are merely clever tricks, leaving the more supernatural stuff out altogether and explaining other things away by showing the Phantom pulling a lever to raise the gates, or messing with Carlotta's throat spray in order to make her croak.

The end of his route in the first game involves confronting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> Shuu, who there refers to himself as Dark Sorcerer Wallenstein and summons Himnesia, Bringer of Death. When Himnesia is defeated Shuu retreats and is never seen at the school again. <em>Bad Boys' Love</em> has a report saying that he secretes hallucinatory pheromones, which he's not immune to, and acts as a neurotransmitter, so he's kind of sucking other characters into his own constant trips... This is an odd sort of mundane, but it seems semi-plausible. Except that Anghel often knows things he should have <em>no way</em> of knowing about &mdash; the weird names he uses for people, if translated, often tie in to secrets they hold, and he seems to have a sense for diseases. In <em>Holiday Star</em> a villain draws blood from him and uses it to take the power of otaku fantasies and convert it into a from which powers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a> &mdash; and the ray is countered by Anghel and some others taking on a fantasy that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> and using their magic powers to shield.

Amusingly, Ooishi takes the side opposite what he does in the novel, and Keiichi doesn't care, since they're all trying to get him anyway. However, it's resolved eventually: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's mostly mundane, with the weirdness being a combination of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">Hate Plague</a>; however, the repeated arcs are due to magic, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">Rika remembers all of them.</a> In other words, there <em>is</em> "magic" at work, but the murder mystery is 100% mundane and magic is only used to "explore" it</span>.

However, the case of the Demon Tsukuyomi is a little more unclear. A person attempted to perform a ritual to summon the Demon Tsukuyomi; however, they died during it and became the 'Demon Tsukuyomi' that the cast face off against. After its defeat, the characters discuss whether the actual Tsukuyomi existed, or whether it was a fool's errand to try and summon it.

There's Fantasy, for those who favor the idea that everything was done by witches and magic, and Mystery, which believes that everything was done by human hands, and that witches were no way involved. This becomes increasingly difficult, as more than a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> are bound to pop up in order to explain everything done by human means.

<ul><li> While the existence of magic is an established part of the setting, the existence of the divine is kept far more ambiguous. In particular, a certain type of spell, known as a "guardian form" is speculated in-universe to be divine in origin (especially due to the fact that it can <em>only</em> be used in defense of self or others). On the one hand, Nanase was praying at the moment she acquired hers, and it does turn her into an angel, making the possibility of divine intervention sound more likely. On the other, it was well within the established rules of the setting for her to gain that spell at that moment, so it may have just been perfectly ordinary magic.
</li><li> Magic users in the comic fall into two categories: "dreaming", where they have limited spells and won't naturally get new ones, and "Awakened", where they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers">Personality Powers</a> spells as long as they keep using magic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> being "sleeping").

He finds three music-playing raccoons who claim to be ghosts, but when his parents arrive, they've disappeared, though Mother Bear seemed to have heard a laugh echoing. It could have gone three ways: either it was a dream, he really did meet some raccoons but they weren't ghosts, or the raccoons did exist and they were ghosts.

<ul><li> Lucy, the goth sister, attempts to cast magic in "Spell it Out", and the spells she casts seemingly work (Lori's phone shutting down, Lana suddenly developing an itch, all of Lucy's siblings losing their voices). However, while Lucy's siblings claim that their incidents stemmed from mundane reasons (Lori's phone ran out of power, Lana played in poison ivy again, the siblings all screamed themselves hoarse while cheering for their Pop-Pop), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChangingPainting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChangingPainting">the painting of Great Grandma Harriet smiles</a>, so it's unknown what really went on. Lucy also sometimes appears unexpectedly, but it's unknown if she can teleport or just walks quietly.
</li><li> Luan's dummy Mr. Coconuts and her boyfriend Benny's dummy (and Mr. Coconuts's crush) Mrs. Appleblossom have both sometimes appeared to move on their own. It's unknown whether this is magic or just very, very elaborate ventriloquism.
</li><li> The existence of ghosts is a mystery. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> claims that they exist, but is revealed to be fraud. Lucy frequently tries to do seances and claims ghosts are her friends, but she's never seen successfully contacting a ghost. Lincoln has also tried to look for ghosts a few times, but has never found any.

This is a change from the original book, where the character is a (male) Middle Eastern magician who sends the girls home to their families on flying carpets!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarthaSpeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarthaSpeaks">Martha Speaks</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "The Puppy Tooth Fairy", Martha and Skits the dogs try to be "puppy tooth fairies" (giving rewards to puppies who lost teeth) but they give it up when it starts to interfere with their sleep schedules. Martha falls asleep and wakes up with a dog treat next to her and thinks this means that a real puppy tooth fairy has shown up. However, Martha hasn't lost any teeth and we never see a fairy or other evidence of a fairy, so maybe it's just that one of Martha and Skits's owners gave the treat to Martha.
</li><li> The main plot of "Martha Gets Spooked" is about Mrs. Parkington mistaking Martha for the ghost of her great-aunt who has the same name. At the end of the episode, a mysterious shape is seen on a photograph. The most likely explanation is that it was just lens flare, but it's never proven either way.

<ul><li> The episode "Hearth's Warming Eve" features creatures known as Windigos&mdash;horses that spread ice and wind and snow wherever there's hatred. At the very end, the Mane Six get in a brief argument while a snowstorm rages on outside. They stop upon hearing the sound of wind, which is eerily similar to the sound of the Windigos. Considering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic">state of the universe</a> the show is set in, the Magic part is very well an option, but a straight answer is never given.
</li><li> The Windigos make a second appearance in "A Hearths Warming Tale" but only in the show's equivalent to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em>, a story that very well might just be fiction, which still leaves them open to debate.

</li><li> Zecora plays this trope straight in "Magic Duel" where she refills a mug of tea by waving her hoof over it. Was it sleight of hand (er, <em>hoof</em>) and a subtle foreshadowing of Twilight's use of stage-magic to take down Trixie, or was it genuine magic which, according to the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> principle shouldn't be possible?

Whether this was just convenient timing or carefully orchestrated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">Tree of Harmony</a> (which is connected to the map) is anypony's guess.
</li><li> "Going to Seed" is about Apple Bloom, Goldie Delicious, and later Applejack, looking for a mythical beast called the Great Seedling who apparently makes patterns with crops and if you catch him, he brings good luck. He's thought to be just a story told to foals, and most of the patterns turn out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to a sleepwalking Big Mac harvesting in his sleep</span>, but the patterns of carrots seen at the end of the episode are left unexplained, so it's still unknown if there is a Great Seedling.

</li><li> The exact nature of ghosts and paranormal happenings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em> is left up to the audience to decide. Being scientists the busters often propose entirely valid (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">at least within the realms of fiction</a>) scientific reasoning for the nature of ghosts (such as suggesting a Headless Horseman can't cross a bridge because of the ionization of the water molecules), but none of this is ever actually <em>confirmed</em> and they also accept the possibility of genuine magic every step of the way. One episode even suggests it's entirely possible for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">"good fridge to go bad"</a> (that is, one that's <em>not</em> affected by the paranormal in any way).

It appears to be a dream, but then a boy who looks just like the guardian angel rides by on a motorbike. So either the guardian angel really exists or it was a freaky coincidence.

Being a victim of what appears to be PTSD, Jack would frequently suffer what appears to be hallucinations. These include the angered and pained spirits of his father and people, victims of a village that was attacked, a rider on a horseback and a suicidal version of himself. The rider would turn out to be a real figure, while the hallucination of himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turned out to be Mad Jack trying to coax him into suicide</span>. While it is doubtful a spec of dust and a frog were actually talking to him even in the world the series takes place in, the images of his father decreeing he had forsaken them and the villagers he failed to save are another matter. The fact that Scaramouche, who killed those villagers, and Ashi, during his talk with Inner Jack and the dustmite, couldn't see anything but Jack apparently talking to himself suggests a good chunk of it was indeed in his head. However, in the penultimate episode where Jack is reasonably of better mental health has him talking to a purified Inner Jack who represented his former world-weariness. Whether Inner Jack is real, a product of his mind, or him imagining to have someone to talk to is not established.

In "Hom-R", when Homer temporarily becomes smarter, he does an equation that supposedly disproves the existence of God, but in another episode, a hand is seen giving a "thumbs up" in the sky after Ned Flanders's prayer comes true.
