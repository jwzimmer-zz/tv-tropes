He explicitly compared it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNegro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNegro">Magical Negro</a>, in that a Manic Pixie Dream Girl exists to help the protagonist achieve happiness without ever seeking any independent goals herself. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/">Rabin would later<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">disown the term</a>, because instead of creating awareness of the "lack of independent goals in female characters", the concept was misunderstood as a condemnation of ALL quirky and fun female characters.
</p><p>Despite all that (or <em>because</em> of all that), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">there are ways of utilizing this trope without falling into that pitfall</a>. Given enough time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> can add to their personality and interests and pull them away from the MPDG foundation. The story may even be told from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchingPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchingPOV">their perspective</a>, revealing that there is more to them than bringing adventure to brooding guys. A MPDG with independent story arc and depth of character can even be the true main character of a work, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">her companion</a> being a hapless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragAlong">Drag Along</a> recruited to assist <em>her</em> goals- his world-expanding adventure is incidental to her need for someone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPackMule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPackMule">carry the cooking pots and backup hang glider</a>.

An alternative type of deconstruction is for a character introduced like this to turn out to be <em>dangerously</em> unstable, tipping over into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">Cute and Psycho</a>, or (more realistically) a damaged and unhealthy individual whose childishness, naivete, and irresponsibility quickly either cause them to wear out their welcome, or suck the main character into a codependent mess that can only end badly.
</p><p>A subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit">Blithe Spirit</a>, and related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend">Magical Girlfriend</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFriendsImproveYourPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFriendsImproveYourPersonality">Loony Friends Improve Your Personality</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselErrant">Damsel Errant</a>. From the girl's perspective, this trope becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleWomanSeeksGoodMan">Single Woman Seeks Good Man</a>, though whether the hero <em>qualifies</em> varies.

May also overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGirlfriend">Trickster Girlfriend</a> if she enjoys playing tricks on the protagonist and deliberately misleading him just for the fun of it.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewballComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewballComedy">Screwball Comedy</a> is a genre driven entirely by this character type.
</p><p>Although not quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a>, a "Manic Pixie Dream Guy" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreMale">much rarer concept</a>. "Manic Pixie Dream Guys", where they exist, tend to either be young (e.g., a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSidekick">Kid Sidekick</a>) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">immature</a>. If the latter, expect them to <em>learn</em> just as much from their cynical partner as they <em>teach</em> (the cynic learns to enjoy life more while the immature one learns responsibility).

Straitlaced protagonist Kyouichi Miyasako, 30 years old, broke up with his quirky, free-spirited girlfriend Ashita Tendou way back in college, and has been haunted by regret ever since. Suddenly, with a UFO hanging in the sky over Tokyo, she returns to him, wearing the same maid costume she was wearing when he dumped her, and she hasn't aged a day. He tentatively accepts her back into his life, even though something feels off about the whole situation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a>.
<ul><li> Kyon was fine with his life as it was, or at least thought so until the day he decided to strike up a conversation with Haruhi, not knowing (at the time) what he was getting himself into. Their meeting gave her the impetus to create the SOS Brigade. Rather than wait around for extraterrestrials, espers, and time travellers to show up, she decided they'd investigate strange happenings around their neighborhood in hopes of finding them herself, and she volunteered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyEverydude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyEverydude">Kyon</a> as her first inductee.
</li><li> The series goes deeper by exploring Haruhi's psyche, revealing that her eccentricity stems from her perpetual boredom. Complicated further when Koizumi explains that Haruhi unknowingly possesses the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reshape reality as they know it, according to her desires.</a> And is convinced she may be the god of their universe. Despite Kyon's initial skepticism, this revelation sheds new light on his perception of Haruhi, and he eventually accepts that Koizumi may be right. He also comes to realize that he actually likes the weirdness that surrounds her and ultimately admits he prefers life <em>with</em> Haruhi than without<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wu6h');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0wu6h" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wu6h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">near the end of <em>"The Disappearance of Suzumiya"</em></span>.

Furthermore, while "customers" know that a Video Girl's love is artificial from the get-go, they're so desperate for affection that a VG's devotion and unconditional affection would win them over regardless, and make them incapable of the real thing in the long run. On the other hand, it is explicitly shown (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as an experiment from Rolex with Video Girl Mai</span>) that equally lonely, brooding, but not-quite-pure-hearted boys would succumb to a severely codependent relationship and would end up broken even worse than they started.

</li><li> Another male example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco">Samurai Flamenco</a></em> has its very main character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">Masayoshi</a>, become this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Goto</a> after a fateful meeting in a dark alley, dragging him into his superhero antics and taking him out of his mundane, boring life.

She inspires him to get back into playing the piano after he quit due to his mother's death several years ago. Slightly subverted in the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has a similar story of trauma in her past &mdash; having been an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> from an early age &mdash; and she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">consciously being a Manic Pixie Dream Girl</a> in order to help Kousei get through his problems</span>.

She also actively pursues classical music on her own terms.

His feelings for her blind him to the fact that Rize was a sociopath that only cared about herself, leaving ruin in her wake and completely unconcerned with how her actions impacted others. She made a pattern of causing problems in a Ward, and then fleeing it the moment her actions attracted attention from the human authorities &mdash; leaving others to deal with the consequences, while she moved to another Ward to continue enjoying herself. In fact, Rize's disregard for the rules of the 11th Ward and killing of its leaders for trying to reign her in, allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Aogiri Tree</a> to move in on the ward and enslave the local Ghoul population.

</li><li> Punpun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoodnightPunpun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoodnightPunpun">Goodnight Punpun</a></em> tries to invoke this with the pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">New Transfer Student</a> Aiko.

</li><li> <em>Fujimi Lovers</em>: If it were any perspective but Jun Kouno's, he definitely fits the trope. His predicament makes it so his first and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">always tragic</a> love, Rino Hasebe, disappears from existence the moment she falls for him.

</li><li> Saber from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateStrangeFake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateStrangeFake">Fate/strange fake</a></em> is a male version with a twist. Saber, like most Manic Pixie Dream Guys, is impulsive, adventurous, relentlessly optimistic, charmingly idiosyncratic, pops into Ayako's life at her lowest and most depressed, and is literally a magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> that exists for Ayako's sake.

But her obsession with gambling is taken to extremes that terrify just about everyone, getting off on the thrill of risking it all and unconcerned with whether she wins or loses. She's repeatedly dragged her friends into these high-risk games, risking freedom and life itself for a thrill. When confronted about how she's ruined so many lives, she admits that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">she doesn't feel any remorse</a>.

However, since the original Catarina was a selfish brat, "Monkey Catarina" showing basic human decency and kindness to those around her is really all it takes to improve their lives. For example, in the game Catarina's adoptive brother Keith is a shallow playboy because she and her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">treated him like crap</a>, but because "Monkey Catarina" always wanted a little brother, she showers him with love and attention which results in his growing into an upstanding young man (albeit with a sister complex).

<ul><li> The modern interpretations of Iris West (former Lois Lane Expy) is this to Barry Allen (the Flash II), who is nerdy and awkward. She initially only uses him as her source within the CCPD, but does grow fond of him. In a realistic nod, she's also depicted as a caffeine addict.
</li><li> Wally West (the Flash III) is this to his wife, Linda Park. When they first met, he was a cocky idiot and she was an uptight news reporter. As time went on, she learned to have more fun with life and he became more mature and responsible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Li'l Depressed Boy</em> has one in hipster girl Jazz, who is a rather straight-up example, but also deconstructed somewhat. Initially, she helps the titular hero, LDB, out of his stupor, with her outgoing personality and general upbeat attitude. Not only that, but she gets him out of his routine, and they share a lot of the same interests... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">then she casually reveals that she has a boyfriend</a>, and is just really touchy-feely with pretty much everyone and sees LDP as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">just a friend and has no idea of how he feels about her</a>. Note that <em>everyone</em>, even random people who don't know the two, thought they were dating. LDP stops talking to her afterwards due to the awkwardness, but she, not knowing she did anything wrong, tries to maintain the friendship. It takes LDP a while to get past it, as it makes him second-guest himself in terms of relationships. Even her mannerisms are deconstructed. When LDP thought they were dating, her manicness was a good thing, since it meant things were always fun and upbeat, with the same thing applying to her touchy-feeliness. But when LDP runs into her later on with his new girlfriend Spike, her talkativeness is played up as more annoying than anything and she comes off as <em>too</em> touchy-feely, hugging someone she just met and all.

There's no hint of a romantic attraction from either side either, and the viewpoint character realistically finds her kind of annoying.
<ul><li> This tends to be Death's role in general. In all her appearances, she turns up, acts quirky and gets people to cheer up or gives them a stern talking to depending on their needs... but she never seems to have any goals or desires of her own other than to amble along and find out what happens next. Justified in that the Endless are strongly defined by their function, so Death by her very nature finds it hard to have strong preferences, since death comes to everyone and is therefore supremely impartial.

David falls in love in a girl named Meg when she appears to literally fly out of the sky on angel wings to give him hope. The event turns out to be a flash mob prank, but Meg sincerely cares for David after hearing about his problems. While Meg resembles the trope in that she is often energetic, has many random quirks, and is devoted to David's wellbeing, she avoids the trope's pitfalls through being fleshed out. Meg has made a job for herself in helping the homeless, is not flawless, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suffers from depression (made worse by not taking her medication)</span>, and has her own life with friends outside of David. This is best demonstrated in a speech she gives him towards the end of the comic, where she promises David she'll help make his name great <em>but</em> she wants her own name great too. <br><br>Much of Meg's traits that resemble MPDG quirks <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/ivyratafia/status/567548867109867521">are actually are based on traits of McCloud's own wife Ivy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

To anyone who's seen that movie, that may seem... strange, but Bess certainly can be seen as a dark subversion of the MPDG archetype.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> seems to play a lot of these roles.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlongCamePolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlongCamePolly">Along Came Polly</a></em>, Aniston plays Polly Prince, a free-spirited bohemian who teaches Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) to be unafraid and live life to the fullest.
</li><li> She plays a quirky flower-shop owner in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveHappens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveHappens">Love Happens</a></em> teaching Aaron Eckhart how to love again and heal after his wife's death.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed Character Archetype</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a>'s 1977 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall">Annie Hall</a></em>. The title character is a cheerful Bohemian, who turns out to be a spoiled, unfocused, pseudointellectual, neurotic child in an adult's body; a horribly broken person. Which gives her something in common with Woody Allen's character, who is likewise horribly broken, just in somewhat different ways. At the end of the movie, it turns out that Alvy was something of a Manic Pixie Dream <em>Guy</em> for Annie, in terms of teaching her how to have more confidence in her abilities and helping her to improve her own life, while most of <em>his</em> problems remain unsolved.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinonaRyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinonaRyder">Winona Ryder</a>'s character Charlotte in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AutumnInNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AutumnInNewYork">Autumn In New York</a></em> is a beautiful artist who suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">a rare heart disease</a>, and teaches a self-centered, skirt-chasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardGere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardGere">Richard Gere</a> about life and love.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Barefoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Barefoot">Barefoot</a></em> takes this a step beyond with the pair-up of dour, debt-owing Jay and carefree <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanChild">Womanchild</a> Daisy, who, yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes">Does Not Like Shoes</a> and blurts out things like "I have to go potty" and "My mom told me driving gets you pregnant."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BenX">Ben X</a></em> has Scarlite, a girl the autistic protagonist Ben plays with in an RPG who talks him out of suicide and inspires him to stand up to the bullying he endures at school. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's subverted, however, by the Scarlite we see for most of the film turning out to be an imaginary construct of Ben's mind.</span>
</li><li> Another male variant is Sam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BennyAndJoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BennyAndJoon">Benny &amp; Joon</a></em>, and he affects <em>two</em> characters. Joon is a mentally-ill woman who falls for him as it comes to light that they understand each other in a way other people don't. Her brother Benny, who's taken care of her all these years, is the uptight character wary of her getting involved with someone else, and has to accept that he's not only being overprotective but also neglecting his personal happiness by worrying so much.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterOffDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterOffDead">Better Off Dead</a></em>, Monique plays this role for Lane, helping pull him out of his depression after his girlfriend dumps him.

</li><li> Sam Rockwell plays the buddy-movie equivalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoxOfMoonlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoxOfMoonlight">Box of Moonlight</a></em>. He wears a Davy Crockett costume and teaches John Turturro to love life; while there's no romance, there's certainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">a lot of naked swimming</a>.

His main function in the plot is to make kooky observations about vegetables and encourage Annie to follow her dreams. It's a slightly more nuanced example than most: his biggest romantic gesture is presented as (at best) well-meaning but tone-deaf, and while he encourages her to follow her dreams (by returning to her love of baking and dream of owning a business), he also encourages her to deal with the mundane realities of her life (by fixing her tail light). She also repeatedly tells him that she doesn't need him to "fix" her.
</li><li> Annie Savoy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BullDurham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BullDurham">Bull Durham</a></em> is sort of consciously a Manic Pixie Dream Girl. She really loves the Durham Bulls, and she knows so much about both baseball and the finer things in life that when she dates a player (she picks one per season) he has the best year of his career. She has a lot of fun with a bunch of strapping young men, helps the team improve at the same time, and makes no apologies for it.
</li><li> Subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cabaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cabaret">Cabaret</a></em>'s Sally Bowles, who demonstrates just how messed up this kind of character tends to be in real life. She and Brian have a lot of fun at first but it's soon illustrated that she loves her partying lifestyle too much <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she aborts their baby because she doesn't think she's mother material</span>. The last scene of the film has her performing a number that implies she's going to continue a life of fun and frivolity &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but the crowd is full of Nazi officers, implying Sally's fun won't last too long</span>.
</li><li> Dylan Morgan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasAndDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasAndDylan">Cas and Dylan</a></em> is a wannabe writer&mdash;as well as a chronic liar, compulsive shoplifter, and general-purpose motormouth who bums a cross-country car ride with Cas Pepper, a widowed doctor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is dying of an inoperable brain tumor</span>. Although Dylan spends three-quarters of the film driving Cas crazy and/or upending his life, a friendship eventually blossoms between the two. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted in that not only is there no romance between the two, Cas also goes through with his plan to end his life&mdash;yet ends up enriching <em>Dylan's</em> life by leaving her all his earthly possessions.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChungkingExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChungkingExpress">Chungking Express</a></em>, features Faye the "California Dreamin'"-obsessed snack bar girl: to help a police officer get over his breakup with a flight attendant, she frequently breaks into (and floods) his apartment, switches the labels on all his canned foods, and rearranges his furniture. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually, he falls for her, but she stands him up and decides to "see the world" by becoming &mdash; yes &mdash; a flight attendant. But don't worry: everything works out okay.</span>
</li><li> Molly, played by Emily Mortimer, in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityIsland">City Island</a></em>, is the catalyst to resolve the dysfunctional family's problems, but her own are not touched on until near the end of the film or resolved during its course, though one could optimistically interpret the manner of her self-effacing withdrawal from the action as her taking the first step towards doing so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clara">Clara</a></em>: Clara is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">downplayed</a> version. Though not so energetic or wacky, she's far more loose and optimistic in comparison to Isaac (a bitter, unhappy man). By working with her and becoming a couple, he gets over the loss of his son that caused this (though she dies).
</li><li> Cluny in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClunyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClunyBrown">Cluny Brown</a></em> has an unusual love of plumbing, enriches the lives of others when she's around, and is rather confused about social orders, especially in the very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Stiff Upper Lip</a> house she goes to live in as a maid.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel">Zooey Deschanel</a> is often identified with this character type in general, although many of her other roles play with the trope rather than serve it up straight.
<ul><li> Allison from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YesMan">Yes-Man</a></em> is a subversion. Her quirky hobbies are entirely for herself, and she's pretty horrified at the idea of just being a tool for Carl's happiness. She also calls him out when he tells her that she's so fearless, and explains that of course she has her own fears, and that she's also perfectly happy living her life without him.
</li><li> Her title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer">(500) Days of Summer</a></em> is a subversion as she doesn't want a steady relationship, pulls out hints of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove">What Is This Thing You Call "Love"?</a>, and at the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she falls in love with and gets married to someone else</span>.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elf">Elf</a></em>, where her character is the jaded, closed-off girlfriend of Will Ferrell's eponymous Manic Pixie Dream Guy.

Rabin defines a Manic Pixie Dream Girl as a character who <em>"exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures"</em>. When Kirsten Dunst was asked about the term directly, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/no-kirsten-dunst-does-not-like-the-term-manic-pixi,62833/">she didn't like it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieKaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a> has examined this concept more than once.
<ul><li> Clementine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EternalSunshineOfTheSpotlessMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EternalSunshineOfTheSpotlessMind">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a></em> is this type of character, though the relationship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">plays out more realistically</a>. She even references the "you complete me" line, to her distaste, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerryMaguire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JerryMaguire">Jerry Maguire</a></em>. She also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this to a certain degree, saying that Joel shouldn't expect her to "save" him, and that she's "just a fucked-up girl looking for her own peace of mind." Joel sums up her MPDG-ness and the film's deconstruction of it during his tape recording for Lacuna:
<div class="indent"><strong>Joel:</strong> I think if there's a truly seductive quality about Clementine, it's that her personality promises to take you out of the mundane. It's like, you secure yourself with this amazing, burning meteorite to carry you to another world, a world where things are exciting. But, what you quickly learn is that it's really an elaborate ruse.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImThinkingOfEndingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImThinkingOfEndingThings">I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a></em> plays this more subtly. Jake is a socially awkward young man, while his girlfriend is a charming intelligent young woman. His mother is delighted that he mmet someone as lively and intelligent as she. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later, though, it is heavily implied that the young woman isn't real, instead an idealized encounter of a real person he briefly interacted with once, brought to life by the films and literature he consumes &mdash; which why she takes on characteristics of the fiction they discuss and the works seen in his room.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Leeloo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">The Fifth Element</a></em> is zany, tiny, and cute. She falls into Bruce Willis's lap and begins reshaping a life that was on a downward spiral through adventure and mayhem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em>:
<ul><li> A truly disturbing example in the form of Marla Singer, who could perhaps best be described as what happens when the Manic Pixie Dream Girl grows up. Marla is dirty, living in poverty, and clearly suffering some form of mental illness, and gets into a fairly unhealthy relationship with Tyler. The narrator is dissatisfied with social norms and consumerist trends, but lacks the will to break out of the mold on his own, leading to his association with Tyler. Marla actually infuriates the narrator because she simply doesn't care about anything. She even calls him out on all his selfish justifications for his behavior being no worse or different than her own.
</li><li> In a way, the confident, flamboyant Tyler is also a MPDG to the uptight nameless narrator. There's a serious homoerotic subtext between them throughout the movie (less surprising when you realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckPalahniuk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckPalahniuk">the author</a> is gay). The narrator just drifts through life until Tyler shows up, and their relationship changes his life and his outlook forever. And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you find out that Tyler was just the narrator's split personality all along. At the end, he kills "Tyler" off</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sarah Lewis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForceOfNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForceOfNature">Force Of Nature</a></em> is an older Manic Pixie Dream Girl who helps Ben Holmes, a blurb writer for hardcover book sleeves, come out of his shell. They sit next to other on an airplane that is struck by a bird and must land. He then travels with her across the country having free-sprited adventures on their way to Savannah, where he is going to get married and she is also headed. He learns to be a better person thanks to Sarah, but ends up getting married and leaving her behind.
</li><li> Back in the 90's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrendanFraser">Brendan Fraser</a></em> played a gender flipped version more than once:

Upon entering the outside world he falls completely in love with Eve and shows her a new perspective on life and about love.
</li><li> Fletcher in <em>Still Breathing (1997)</em> is a sensitive artist who puts together rock sculptures and does puppetry for a living. After he begins to have visions of his one true love, he drops everything to go meet her and show her that true love is indeed real.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a>'s character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GardenState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GardenState">Garden State</a></em>. A fantastic representation of this trope. The main character is a guy on anti-depressant and mood stabilizers, she's a bubble of quirk who floated into his life, who randomly shakes about like a kid at one point "doing something that's completely unique, that's never been done before" and advises him to laugh all the time. By the end, he's screaming into abysses and doing dramatic runs through airports in the name of love.
</li><li> Subverted with Enid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostWorld">Ghost World</a></em>: told from the perspective of a sarcastic teen girl as she teaches Seymour, a shy, obsessive older man how to take chances and enjoy living; of course this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destroys his life. Enid leaves to build her own life somewhere else. Seymour ends up in therapy</span>.
</li><li> Stella from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GideonsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GideonsDaughter">Gideons Daughter</a></em> is a middle-aged Manic Pixie Dream Girl for the film's brooding middle-aged hero. Though Stella has her own issues and isn't a chirpy twentysomething, she basically exists so Gideon can enjoy life again.
</li><li> The eponymous character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGirlNextDoor2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGirlNextDoor2004">The Girl Next Door</a></em> gets the hero, Matthew Kidman, off of his overachieving ass to loosen up and have some fun for once in his life.

He's a quirky, charming hotel concierge who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury">acts like he just walked out from a wormhole to the Victorian era</a>, and has numerous eccentric habits including art theft and sleeping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">MUCH older women</a>. He hires Zero to work at the eponymous Hotel, and quickly becomes his best friend and the closest thing he has to a family member after all his blood relatives were massacred in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, all the while teaching Zero the hotel trade and ushering him into the best years of his life. He also fits the darker permutation of this character type as his eccentricities mask numerous insecurities, particularly the fact that he knows his time will soon come to an end with the impending specter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and sure enough, as soon as he's finished teaching Zero everything he knows, he's promptly killed off, leaving Zero to impart what he's learned to the next generation in the form of the film's narrator</span>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyGoLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyGoLucky">Happy-Go-Lucky</a></em>. The main character, Poppy, is a free-spirited extreme optimist who starts taking driving lessons from an uptight, closed-off pessimist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who develops a crush on her</span>. Subverted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in that she doesn't return the feelings, and stops the driving lessons so they won't see each other again after he lampshades this trope with a rant about how selfish it is &mdash; even if she ultimately doesn't fit the trope, no one could convince him differently</span>.
</li><li> Maude in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HaroldAndMaude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HaroldAndMaude">Harold and Maude</a></em> is an unusual example in that she's about 60 years older than the man. A vivacious, eccentric and well-traveled woman, she teaches Harold to live life to the fullest and get over his morbid obsession with death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoldieHawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoldieHawn">Goldie Hawn</a> played this type in <em>Cactus Flower</em> (1969) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ButterfliesAreFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ButterfliesAreFree">Butterflies Are Free</a></em> (1972). In both films she plays madcap, giggly, high-energy blondes that bring a bolt of excitement into the life of a lonely man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenlyCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenlyCreatures">Heavenly Creatures</a></em> is a darkly subverted lesbian version &mdash; wild, eccentric Juliet inspires shy Pauline not to embrace life, but to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murder her mother</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Her" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Her">Her</a></em>: Theodore's ex-wife accuses him of wanting her to be that way, a happy object to balance out his dour, brooding self, and suggests he's dating a computer because she's less complicated than a real woman. Samantha, his new computer/girlfriend, expresses the same opinion and tells Theodore she's tired of acting the way he wants her to act.
</li><li> Heather Graham's character Mandy in 2003 film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HopeSprings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HopeSprings">Hope Springs</a></em> brings meaning back to life, with her free-spirited American ways (becoming the new love interest), of her opposite: broody, just-dumped British male lead Colin, played by Colin Firth.
</li><li> April in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine">Hot Tub Time Machine</a></em>. Played surprisingly straight, she just appears in Adam's life, fixates on him (particularly odd, since she's apparently an established music journalist and Adam's a teenager), takes him out of the dull funk that he's in, and even engages in some low-level breaking and entering for the sake of romance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHouseOfYes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHouseOfYes">The House of Yes</a></em>, the main character is a part of a wealthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a> and has a few issues of his own to work out. He does this by dating a ditzy, middle class girl with a cheerful demeanor.
</li><li> Kevin Franklin is a male example of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Houseguest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Houseguest">Houseguest</a></em>. Franklin however, is only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a> who (at least at first) doesn't care about improving the lives of the people he meets, but ends up doing so anyway.
</li><li> Gwen Phillips in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Housesitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Housesitter">Housesitter</a></em>, a con artist and a pathological liar, plays this role for Newton Davis, played by Steve Martin. He's almost as crazy as she is. They're kind of Manic Pixie Dream people to each other.
</li><li> An early example is in 1968's <em>I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!</em> (included in the A.V. Club list). Straitlaced Harold Fine, already feeling dissatisfied with life, encounters Nancy, the friend of his hippie little brother, and lets her spend the night at his apartment. As thanks, she makes him pot brownies, though he doesn't realize what they are until he's consumed them. Loosened up, he goes to thank her and they ultimately become lovers. Harold becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayBride">Runaway Groom</a> to both be with Nancy and fully embrace the hippie lifestyle. But after the initial bliss, the existence and his relationship with her proves as unfulfilling and superficial as his old life was. In the end he chooses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and find his own path to happiness alone.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouBethCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouBethCooper">I Love You, Beth Cooper</a></em>. Although Beth Cooper's character does have a lot of these qualities, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's actually very insecure and the protagonist ends up changing <em>her</em> outlook on life simply by showing her that she has a lot more potential than she's giving herself credit for</span>.
</li><li> The whole point of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouMan">I Love You, Man</a></em>. Where Peter Klaven's repressed real estate agent is taught how to live life by the maniac pixie dream guy Sydney Fife.
</li><li> Geet in the 2007 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/JabWeMet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/JabWeMet">Jab We Met</a></em> &mdash; childlike and wacky to the point where the male lead, a weary businessman, says she "needs a psychiatrist," until she brings him out of his shell. And then, some plot later, he becomes a Manic Pixie Dream Guy for her.
</li><li> Subverted by Catherine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JulesAndJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JulesAndJim">Jules and Jim</a>.</em> Compelling as she is, Catherine's joie-de-vivre comes hand in hand with bipolar tendencies, selfishness, and a constant sense of discontent. She's a whirlwind of energy, and instead of that being a positive force, she sort of just ends up imploding in on herself. The questionable aspects of her behavior escalate until she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills herself and Jim by driving them off a bridge in her car out of a mixture of depression and sheer whimsy</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno">Juno</a></em> was unintentionally this for Mark Loring, much to her dismay. Sort of reversed though with Paulie Bleeker- she may be the quirkier of the two but he was the one who opened her cynical heart.
</li><li> Gender-reversed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/KalHoNaaHo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/KalHoNaaHo">Kal Ho Naa Ho</a></em>: Naina is an overstressed MBA student who doesn't believe in the power of love. Then wacky romantic Aman comes to her neighborhood and teaches her to enjoy life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillingZoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillingZoe">Killing Zoe</a></em> features a Manic Pixie Dream Girl caught in the middle of a bank heist. She eventually gets a machine gun. Death ensues.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MilaKunis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MilaKunis">Mila Kunis</a>' character in <em>Moving McAllister</em> is an unabashed example of this trope, described by her uncle as very beautiful and "wild" she is bent upon turning the boring lawyer she just met into someone who loves life. Kunis' character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForgettingSarahMarshall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForgettingSarahMarshall">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a></em> is also a straight MPDG.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahJessicaParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahJessicaParker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>'s character SanDeE from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LAStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LAStory">L.A. Story</a></em> (1991) starring and written by Steve Martin. Although SanDeE is a bit more nuanced take on the character. She is a classic Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but the movie portrays a relationship with her as shallow and self-indulgent for Martin's character. He is better paired with the quirky British woman.
</li><li> Double-subverted <em>twice</em> in the Barbara Stanwyck comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadyEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadyEve">The Lady Eve</a>.</em> So Jeanne brightens up the life of stiff, repressed Charles (or "Hopsie") &mdash; but the fact is that she's a con woman who wants to take his money. But then, she's also in love with him, and is willing to go straight for his sake. Then when he finds out and rejects her, she takes on the persona of the Lady Eve, and pulls the MPDG on him <em>again.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LarryCrowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LarryCrowne">Larry Crowne</a></em>: Talia (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) personifies this trope to the point where Mercedes Tainot (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts">Julia Roberts</a>) even refers to her as a pixie. The only area where she breaks the stereotype is that she has no romantic interest in Larry (Tom Hanks) and her efforts are aimed at getting him together with Mercedes.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulietteLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulietteLewis">Juliette Lewis</a> frequently played versions of this role early in her career. Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsEatingGilbertGrape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsEatingGilbertGrape">What's Eating Gilbert Grape</a></em> but, notably, a very dark subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kalifornia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kalifornia">Kalifornia</a></em>. In the latter, she keeps a cactus in her purse and has done well when Early doesn't whip her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Keith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Keith">Keith</a></em>, the titular character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMaleExample">Rare Male Example</a>. Natalie is the quintessential perfect high school student who has her whole life planned out for her, and Keith takes it upon himself to show her how to have fun through his bizarre, unconventional ideas of amusement. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's dying, presumably of cancer, and he's just looking for one last thrill and decides to make it his mission to "have fun with her." Unfortunately for him, he winds up falling in love with her, just as he's come to accept his imminent death</span>.
</li><li> Although she's more grounded and less 'out there' than the usual bizarre Dream Girls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LivTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LivTyler">Liv Tyler</a>'s character in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LonesomeJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LonesomeJim">Lonesome Jim</a></em> is a warm and life-embracing character whose only purpose in the movie is to teach the self-absorbed, miserable main character to cheer up despite the audience wondering what the heck a woman like that would see in him.
</li><li> The Hallmark Channel movie <em>Love at First Glance</em> has a male version. It's explained that he learned to love life after encountering his own MPDG. After her tragic accident, he became a MPDB for other people.
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/May" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/May">May</a></em> doesn't remotely fit this stereotype, but the art school bohemian Adam and May's lesbian co-worker Polly both seem to identify her as one. They shelve the movie in the Horror section, so you can gather things don't go well. Some fans, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUJklyYhXkM">such as<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NeedsMoreGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NeedsMoreGay">Rantasmo</a>, have pegged May as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed Character Archetype</a>, as both Adam and Polly fetishize only May's "quirky" surface qualities and then leave her when they decide that they don't like the rest of the person that those qualities are attached to, and furthermore, May's quirkiness turns out to be indicative of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyLonerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyLonerGirl">Creepy Loner Girl</a> more than anything.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityImpersonator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityImpersonator">Impersonator</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> Impersonator in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MisterLonely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MisterLonely">Mister Lonely</a></em>.
</li><li> Little Bo Peep is this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MotherGooseRockNRhyme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MotherGooseRockNRhyme">Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme</a></em>, a Disney Channel movie from the early 90s.

Mother Goose couldn't find a rhyme for Gordon</span>.
</li><li> The eponymous <em>Mr Jones (1993)</em> is a male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">deconstruction</a>, since he has literal bipolar disorder, but does somewhat enrich the female lead's life when in his manic phase.
</li><li> Molly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrMagoriumsWonderEmporium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrMagoriumsWonderEmporium">Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium</a></em>. Though the romantic element of their relationship is downplayed, she helps the new accountant Henry learn not to take himself too seriously, with the assistance of frequent customer, Eric.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MySassyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MySassyGirl">My Sassy Girl</a></em>:
<ul><li> The trailer shows Elisha Cuthbert playing a version of this. However, instead of simply being "quirky," she is portrayed as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, in that she may very well <em>kill</em> the protagonist for a lark.
</li><li> In the original Korean movie, Cuthbert-equivalent's character's "quirky antics" tend to have harmful consequences, but the protagonist falls for her anyway and she does indeed teach him to live and love. However, she definitely has issues and motivations unrelated to her man, and it turns out that she's been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">a substitute for her dead fianc&eacute;</a>, who was the protagonist's cousin</span>. Things end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">working out</a>, though.
<ul><li> The original Korean movie arguably has the polar opposite moral to the classic MPDG movie. The male protagonists had been coasting through his college classes, basically being a slacker, until falling in love and realizing that real relationships were difficult, confusing, complex things actually gives him motivation to get his act together for the first time in his life. He goes from incompetent slacker to hard-working, composed, goal-oriented young man. It's about him learning to be serious rather than learning to cut loose. Furthermore, what draws him to the girl is, not her 'free spirit' &mdash; which he actually find off-putting; rather it his recognition that she is 'damaged' and a strong desire to fix her. Which is just one of several ways the film mocks gender expectations by having the male lead take the stereotypically female role. (It's usually the girl who wants to heal the wounded bad boy, after all.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNamesOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNamesOfLove">The Names Of Love</a></em>, straitlaced Arthur is yanked out of his boring life by the younger, free-spirited, free-loving Baya, who's so manic she occasionally forgets to put clothes on when going out of her flat.
</li><li> The 2009 ultra-low-budget independent film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewLow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewLow">New Low</a></em> is a subversion &mdash; Vicky is a bigger jerk than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">loser</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> protagonist Wendell, while Joanna <em>would</em> be a Manic Pixie Dream Girl were Wendell not a complete idiot as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoStringsAttached" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoStringsAttached">No Strings Attached</a></em> has a gender-inverted example with Adam, the Manic Pixie Dream Guy &mdash; a goofy, romantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanService">Mr Fan Service</a>, who helps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">cynical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGetterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoGetterGirl">Go-Getter Girl</a> Emma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">get over her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues">Commitment Issues</a>.
</li><li> The Evangelical Christian film <em>Old Fashioned</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>. Quirky, free-spirited Amber fits the trope to a T; but in the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it is the somber, self-hating Clay who shows her that relationships have responsibilities, and life is not all about the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">warm and fuzzies</a></span>."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OtherHalves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OtherHalves">Other Halves</a></em> has a male variation in Mike, who's described as a "sexy chore listen man."
</li><li> The eponymous Rory O'Shea in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoryOSheaWasHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RoryOSheaWasHere">Rory O'Shea Was Here</a></em> with regards to the care home he's put into. He convinces the protagonist Michael, a man with cerebral palsy, to be rebellious and live life to the full. It's he who gets Michael out of the prison-like care home and into a nice apartment. Of course he's also called out for a lot of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> behaviour, and he is partially motivated out of his own self interest.
</li><li> Two gender-flipped examples play this straight in the Mo'Nique led film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhatGirlz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhatGirlz">Phat Girlz</a>.</em> Dr. Tunde and Dr. Akibo are two Nigerian men that teach the plus-sized leads to embrace their bodies and sensuality. Even to start loving themselves and changing their outlook.
</li><li> Joan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlayingByHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlayingByHeart">Playing by Heart</a></em> is one, but her relationship with Keenan plays out a bit more balanced than is usual for the trope. She certainly teaches him to embrace love and life again, but he's also more mature than her usual boyfriends, giving her some much-needed stability.
</li><li> Jordan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RealGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RealGenius">Real Genius</a></em> lives somewhere between here and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloudcuckooland</a>.

Pookie fulfills all of the requirements of a MPDG, including breaking the lead character out of his shell. But towards the end of the film is revealed she is much more damaged and vulnerable than anyone has expected. She completely breaks out of the traditional mold at the ending, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she and her boyfriend break up, and she is literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a></span>.

</li><li> One of the all-time classics of Hollywood is an extremely dark but one hundred percent straight use of this trope, in which an eccentric, aging beauty queen, whose grip on reality is shaky, takes over the protagonist's life, using money and her luxurious life to tighten her hold on him. The character is Norma Desmond; the film is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SunsetBoulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a>.</em>

Stumbling into her life, Nelson soon realizes Sara lives a lifestyle of voluntarily taking men under her wing to "change their lives for the better" in one way or another (MPDG for a living, if you will). So Sara asks Nelson (whose one and only concern in life is himself): "Do you want to be my November?" The rules are: no questions, no holding back, and no more and no less than ONE month.

To quote the IMDb summary: "[The lead character] lives a quiet and peaceful life, working diligently and writing in his spare time. One day, Betty walks into his life, a young woman who is as beautiful as she is wild and unpredictable...". The trope is, however, deconstructed, as Betty is not quite right in the head.
</li><li> Jack from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic (1997)</a></em> is a rare case of a male spin of this trope. Rose was feeling cold and alone in high society, when Jack comes along and teaches her to be free-spirited and live life. Rose's narration describes him as saving her in every way a person can be saved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waitress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Waitress">Waitress</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart">Spear Counterpart</a>, Nathan Fillion plays Keri Russell's ridiculously convenient and personality-lite bit-on-the-side, otherwise fulfilling all the typical criteria of the MPDG. Interestingly enough, the main character fulfills this trope in the lives of just about everyone around her, if you were to write a film centering on Nathan Fillion's character, or Adrienne Shelly's character, or Jeremy Sisto's character, it's exactly the role she would play (though in the last case it would be <em>very</em> bluntly subverted).

He partly wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PaperTowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PaperTowns">Paper Towns</a></em> to deconstruct this trope further out of concerns that he didn't do a thorough enough job of it with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LookingForAlaska" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LookingForAlaska">Looking for Alaska</a></em> (which <em>does</em> deconstruct the trope, but in a different and arguably more abstract manner, and is primarily focused on death and suffering and how we individually figure out how to deal with their inevitable reality): that the people whom we idealize are in fact just as vulnerable, selfish, flawed, and self-destructive as anyone else, if not <em>more so</em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LookingForAlaska" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LookingForAlaska">Looking for Alaska</a></em>: Alaska Young is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed Character Archetype</a> of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl told through the lens of someone who sees her as such.

Ivy believes (or wants to) she <em>is</em> a pixie, or some kind of nymph or sprite, in human form. She leads Martha on adventures, getting into almost Abbott and Costello scrapes at age seven, ending in tragedy years later. Most important, she gives Martha an opportunity and environment to be herself, free of her family's expectations.

</li><li> Alice Somerfield of A.M. Holmes' <em>The End of Alice</em> is an example that might be controversial. For a twelve-year-old, she is wildly, uncomfortably sexually precocious (most likely not her fault), has an extensive and pretentious vocabulary and a manner of speech that is self-confessed as "affected," is sarcastic and beyond her years, has a knowledge of many varied and random subjects, claims to paint watercolor images on intimate places and watch them wash away in her baths, and copies famous poems onto the soles of her shoes.
</li><li> The novel <em>Steppenwolf</em> has Hermine, who not only gets the protagonist to enjoy life more, but actually saves him from killing himself.

</li><li> Midori from Haruki Murakami's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorwegianWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorwegianWood">Norwegian Wood</a></em> fits this role quite well. The first time she and Toru kiss, they are sitting on her roof, watching a neighborhood fire. Constantly hyper-energetic and quirky, she has no hesitation in revealing her constant sexual fantasies to Toru, who is much more distant and reserved with his inner thoughts. However, Midori does have some psychological issues of her own, particularly her relationship with her strict and distant parents and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">calls Toru out towards the end of the book for stringing her along while he pines over Naoko.</a>

</li><li> Maggie Dempsey in <em>How NOT to Be Popular</em> by Jennifer Ziegler ends up like this, much to her annoyance.

</li><li> Marion Kirby in <em>Topper</em> and <em>Topper Takes a Trip</em> by Thorne Smith as she drags Cosmo Topper out of his staid banker's existence. However, it is a subversion as Marion is a ghost and acts in concert with her husband George (who died in the same traffic accident) and various other ghosts. In the movie version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaryGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaryGrant">Cary Grant</a> played George Kirby in <em>Topper</em> (1937), but was written out of its two sequels.
<ul><li> Quite a few Thorne Smith novels have at least one Manic Pixie Dream Girl strewing chaos in her wake, although in a number of occasions closer examination reveals they are in fact subversions or aversions (<em>Turnabout</em> for instance generates its comedy from having a quarreling husband and wife being put into each other's bodies by an exasperated god).
<ul><li> In <em>The Stray Lamb</em>, T. Lawrence Lamb's life is thrown out of kilter by a mysterious little man magically turning him into various animals, which enables him to approach the object of his affections and to rid himself of his adulterous wife.
</li><li> The sprite Megaera in <em>The Night Lift of the Gods</em> enables Hunter Hawk to enjoy life, but the end is bittersweet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as he now no longer fits into the world and the two lovers turn themselves into stone, effectively becoming united in death</span>.
</li><li> Josephine Duval in <em>The Bishop's Jaegers</em> play the trope fairly straight.
</li><li> In <em>The Passionate Witch</em> (on which the movie <em>I Married a Witch</em> is based), the titular character turns out to be the villain of the story. But that novel, Thorne Smith's last, was left unfinished and was completed by another writer.

</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed Character Archetype</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HighFidelity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HighFidelity">High Fidelity</a></em>: while in college Rob goes out with a girl named Charlie who he perceives to be one of these, and when she dumps him he never really gets over it. Meeting her again, years later, he realizes that she is actually a pretentious, vapid, self-important idiot whose "quirkiness" is merely to cover up that she has no personality of her own, and he was just too immature to realize this at the time.
</li><li> E.F. Benson &mdash; of <em>Mapp And Lucia</em> fame &mdash; wrote a trilogy of novels about a turn of the 19th/20th-century version of the MPDG. But Dodo is anything but good for the men in her life &mdash; or herself &mdash; until she grows up a bit and earns her happily ever after.
</li><li> Sam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePerksOfBeingAWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePerksOfBeingAWallflower">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a></em> is a sort of blander interpretation of this trope, probably to balance out the socially awkward recipient of her mania, Charlie.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s works largely avoid this: female characters are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> types or ethereal, magical Elven princesses. But <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnfinishedTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnfinishedTales">The Unfinished Tales</a></em> features Tar-Vanimeld&euml;, Queen of N&uacute;menor. She was more interested in dancing and playing music than actually, you know, governing the most powerful nation on Middle-Earth, so she left all the boring, practical day-to-day stuff to her consort, Herucalmo. Since the Tale is Unfinished, it's not really clear what Tolkien meant for Tar-Vanimeld&euml;, but she fits many of the requirements, at least by Middle-Earth standards. Possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">Deconstructed Character Archetype</a>, since it seems Herucalmo was not okay with this: when the Queen died, he finally got sick of being the stable, modest, supportive guy and usurped the throne for himself.
</li><li> Barry Lyga's <em>The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl</em> deconstructs this trope with Kyra, whom the protagonist may or may not be romantically interested in. She initially encourages the male lead to be assertive and pursue his dreams, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but she also encourages his violent fantasies. Eventually, the protagonist realizes that she is extremely depressed and possibly mentally ill</span>.
</li><li> Ida Maclaird in <em>The Girl with Glass Feet</em> by Ali Shaw is a straight example of one, if a little mild. Ida's a vague, ethereal little thing who had wild adventures in the past and in the book teaches Midas Crook, a lonely amateur photographer, to embrace life to the fullest before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she dies by turning into glass</span>. There's also Midas' mother Evaline and Ida's mother Freya as winsome muse figures who inspired two lonely, jaded academics to pine after them indefinitely, which may or may not count.
</li><li> Jenny from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruthOfRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruthOfRockAndRoll">The Truth of Rock and Roll</a></em> has some elements of this, though she also has her dark moments and her own character arc. Also, the protagonist is the one who sought <em>her</em> out.
</li><li> Holly tries to enact this role for Phil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snyper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snyper">Snyper</a></em>, saying he's a grumble bear who needs to lighten up. What she doesn't understand is that he's actually more reckless and impulsive than she is, which leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phil ending their relationship by shooting her in the head with one of his anti-love bullets.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExilesViolin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheExilesViolin">The Exile's Violin</a></em>: Clay <em>thinks</em> Jacquie is one of these for him; an exciting and risk taking woman that enriches his dull and unfulfilling life, but personalitywise she's nothing like the standard. Ultimately, the trope is genderflipped because it is <em>Clay</em> that helps Jacquie loosen up and enjoy life, and his personality as a thrill seeking happy guy fits the standard.
</li><li> Julia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> is, like the rest of the book, a horrific example. Sure, her presence livens up Winston's life and exposes him to things he never dreamed of, but it's clear that their relationship is based more on rebellion against Big Brother than any actual affection and they often seem to outright <em>hate</em> each other. (At one point Winston <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">casually talks about a fantasy he had of <em>raping</em> her.</span>)
<ul><li> Her impulsive, childish behaviour would be considered emotionally immature by anyone in our world, but is arguably typical of the deliberately dumbed down population of Oceania.

It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedCharacterArchetype">deconstructed</a> in that Shintaro &mdash; while genuinely (internally) grateful for her &mdash; was too self-absorbed to show affection back, while Ayano suffered through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her mother's death and subsequently finding out that her father is planning to kill two of her best friends</span> alone, which eventually results in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her suicide, in an attempt to get an eye power</span>, this in turn the primary reason that Shintaro is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">Hikikomori</a> when the story opens.
</li><li> Ene also acts as one to Shintaro, constantly urging him to go outside. She just so happens to also be a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">troll when he pisses her off</a>.

She's very eccentric and many in the royal court thought she was unsuited to be queen but Chivalry preferred this to "proper" ladies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MahouShoujoTheGlowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MahouShoujoTheGlowing">Mahou Shoujo The Glowing</a></em> Jennifer fits this trope. She comes into Colette's life, introduces her to being a magical girl, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Helps her get over Sarah's death</span>. They eventually enter a romantic relationship.
</li><li> Elly from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBehemoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBehemoth">The Behemoth</a></em> is an interesting deconstruction: she's actually a fairly normal young woman, with her own life and aspirations, but her best friend &mdash; the lead character, Roger &mdash; sees her as something like this and develops an emotional dependence upon her as a result, despite never being able to romantically approach her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Marina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Marina">Marina</a></em> deconstructs the trope. The titular girl is presented as looking from the lonely protagonist's dreams, and in fact, she turns into the main source of light in his otherwise joyless and somber life, also becoming his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>.

As the story progresses, however, it becomes clear she's actually a <em>very</em> dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>, and a big part of Henry's character arc is realizing their relationship is actually utterly toxic on both their ends. For her, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out she's still in love with her dead boyfriend, who she'd been with since age nine and who died in a car accident she inadvertently caused, and has inserted herself into his life to groom him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> (due to, we discover toward the end, the dead guy's middle name being "Henry")</span>. For him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he sees her as less of a person and more of a pet project that he hopes to turn into his ideal girlfriend, at one point comparing her to a kind of Japanese art made of pieces of broken ceramics, which offends her. The story ends with them deciding they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a>, and a <em>lot</em> more mentally healthy too</span>.

For one thing, she is a minor Japanese goddess whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceshipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceshipGirl">"ghost"</a> inhabits a magical sword; for another, she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> who urges him to make truth of his dream of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious">death or glory on the battlefield</a>.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">Older Than Television</a> example is Sally Seton from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginiaWoolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VirginiaWoolf">Virginia Woolf</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsDalloway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsDalloway">Mrs Dalloway</a></em>. Sally shows up at Clarissa's ancestral home without a penny and, with her idiosyncratic behavior (smoking cigars, running naked along the hallway when she forgets the soap) and lack of concern for the judgments of others, she helps both to awaken Clarissa's bisexuality and to show her that there are possibilities outside the stuffy parameters of British upper-class society. The recipient of Sally's manic pixieness is a woman and both of them eventually settle into contented but conventional marriages and live outwardly very normal lives.
</li><li> Mattie Silver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EthanFrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EthanFrome">Ethan Frome</a></em>. Ethan, who feels trapped in a loveless marriage to her hypochondriac cousin Zeena, comes to view her as his one chance to escape the bleakness of his life and future prospects. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately, her impulsive nature leads to their ruin: she talks him into committing suicide together rather than be forced apart, but their suicide attempt fails and leaves him barely able to walk and her unable to walk at all. Years after that failed suicide, she's shown to have lost all of her beauty and liveliness and become even crankier and more disagreeable than Zeena.</span>
</li><li> In <em>I'm Not Your Manic Pixie Dream Girl</em>, Beatrice is dumped by her boyfriend for a quirkier girl and tries to become a Manic Pixie Dream Girl herself to win him back. It fails and she learns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">being yourself</a>. It's also shown that even the "quirky" girl her boyfriend ditched her for is more well-rounded than the shallow MPDG stereotype Beatrice initially saw her as.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneGirl">Gone Girl</a></em>, as Amy goes on a rant about this trope, commenting that it's a male fantasy that women participate in to be considered attractive. She comments that she knew this was what Nick was looking for when they first met so she pretended to be "Cool Girl" for Nick, but became incensed when he didn't fulfil what she saw as <em>his</em> end of the bargain by being her "Cool Guy" and their marriage falls apart because neither of them can keep up the act anymore. Nick in general has an apparent habit of falling for women like this, only to resent them later when it turns out that they have their own personality flaws, owing to his inability to deal with angry women.

She doesn't exist solely as a love interest for Sid, but whenever the story is focusing on him this is clearly how he sees her. She's quite self-serving at times, and it's debatable whether she ultimately changes his life for the better. She makes him blissfully happy at times, and utterly miserable at others. A relationship with someone so mentally unstable they try to commit suicide when you cancel a date was never going to run entirely smoothly. In her Season 7 episodes, Pure, she has completely changed and now rejects this Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope. Cassie is no longer the wild, carefree pill popping girl she one was and has now depressingly matured into a young lonely woman who rarely socialises. She has seemingly out grown this trope and has realised being a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' in the real world can never work.

Winchester loses a chance at love, and not because his family would disapprove &mdash; though that's a consideration for him &mdash; but because he can't bring himself to accept this aspect of hers.

Notably, the group occasionally finds her actions annoying or intrusive, and in the 10th season, Phoebe admits that she has never been in a relationship which lasted more than a month. Occasionally, being an Manic Pixie Dream Girl seems to actively work against her, such as the first time she was ready to move in with a man, and then broke up with him shortly after when he impulsively shot a bird with his handgun. On another occasion, she ends a relationship because her boyfriend is <em>even more</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart">Manic Pixie Dream Guy</a> than she is, and she can't stand him.
</li><li> Monica gets a personal non-romantic Manic Pixie Dream Girl for one episode in the form of the "other Monica", an eccentric woman who stole her credit card. Monica follows her, first to see her and possibly report her, but she enjoys tap lessons and crashing parties with her way too much.
</li><li> Emily Waltham, Ross's girlfriend, had shades of this trope and similar effect on Ross. They spontaneously went to Vermont and enthusiastically watched animals and enjoyed the autumn there, he played rugby because of her, she made him pierce his ear and enroll in helicopter lessons.

It turns out that Clara <em>is</em> actually just a normal girl, although one brave enough to save the Doctor by manipulating his own timeline.

<ul><li> Leonard and his friends Sheldon, Howard and Raj are content with their lives of scientific research at Caltech and being concerned with any given upcoming nerdy activity such as Klingon Boggle. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGirl">Penny</a> moves in next door she is neither a genius or a nerd, but is actually an average girl with a vibrant social life. Being around her Leonard can't help but see the contrast between her going out dancing and them sitting at home playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> together. While it is most evident with Leonard as they become romantically involved with each other, everyone evolves significantly by having her in their lives.
</li><li> In a reversal, Penny never really gave much thought to the academic pursuits these guys are involved with on a daily basis. While she is hopelessly unable to keep up with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">Technobabble</a> after some time she retains and is fascinated with a few thought experiments, famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchrodingersCat">Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat</a> in the first season finale. By the fourth season she has admitted that it is hard for her to keep less intelligent company around.

Even from the beginning she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">struggling actress</a>, and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues">Commitment Issues</a> always threatens to put her and Leonard back to square one. Leonard actually got around that by putting the power of getting married in her hands, so that she wouldn't feel pressured by him.
</li><li> Leonard and Penny get engaged late in the seventh season, and a recurring element in the eighth season is that they are worried about their relationship being one of convenience and if their attraction to each other has any real depth to it. The gist of it comes down to being that Leonard sees Penny as an attractive and outgoing girl who enjoys offering physical affection like hugs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">something he never got from his mom</a>) and Penny sees Leonard as a good guy who is wildly unlike her past, sleazy boyfriends and whose intelligence is inspiring. But their differing personalities leaves lingering doubt in the back of their heads. Penny even tells Leonard "Your complete and utter devotion to me is what we built this entire relationship on!"

Castle describes her as a "deep-fried twinkie" &mdash; tastes great, but really bad for you.
</li><li> Castle himself begins the show claiming to be a Manic Pixie Dream Boy to Kate Beckett. (This is interesting considering the fact that Beckett herself serves as the related trope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMuse">The Muse</a> to Castle.) Like most MPDBs he gets plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> over time, and it's more that than his "fun" that wins Kate over.

Melissa is a lot into crystals, psychics and New Age stuff and tries to get Mulder to leave his "dark" place and drop his cynicism and paranoia. Not surprising he's depressed as his partner and only friend Scully is dying. Refreshingly, Mulder is most definitely <em>not</em> impressed and absolutely uninterested in her happy and playful ways.

The eponymous Mother appears to approach this character trope but at the same time he is also this for her. She is effectively portrayed as Ted's dream girl, having quirks such as painting pictures of robots, singing show tunes while making breakfast, playing bass guitar in a band and helping pull Ted out of one of the darkest times in his life. Season 9 reveals more quirks such as owning a pair of driving gloves and wanting to see weird stuff on roadside, just like Ted. She also helps pull Ted out of a rather dark time in his life as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Robin marries Barney, when Ted always felt that she should be with him</span>. Most of Ted's quirks are similarly appealing to her.

</li><li> Gender-flipped, played with, and ultimately subverted in <em>No Tomorrow</em>. Xavier has no job and spends all his time coming up with wacky stuff he wants to do and encourages Evie to do the same...not because of his own personality, but because he believes an asteroid will wipe out humanity in less than a year so he might as well just do whatever he wants with his remaining time. Evie has fun with it for a while, but when she waffles on quitting her job, Xavier steals her phone and sends a profane text to her boss saying she quits. Evie wastes no time telling him how far over the line it was, and he quickly agrees to never do anything like it again, enabling them to remain on good terms.

</li><li> A truly unusual example comes from Root in Person Of Interest, with much more depth and with two different relationships. She serves as a platonic version of this to Finch, trying to improve his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI">The Machine</a>, and willing to do anything to protect him. She also has this dynamic with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">her love interest</a>, Shaw, in which Root tries to bring Shaw out of her emotionless shell. Though unlike most love interest examples, Shaw is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">something of a sociopath</a>, who has extreme difficulty having emotions for others.

</li><li> Fran Fine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em> is an upbeat and exuberant Jewish working class woman, who brings a much needed new spirit into the entire household of her more uptight widowed British employer, Maxwell Sheffield. Fran is the protagonist though, so she's a more well-developed character than the more negative examples of the trope. And even though Maxwell is attracted to her already from early on, he has huge commitment issues and needs almost five years to finally propose marriage to Fran.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>, there's an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> of this trope during the courtship between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert: it is the brooding and serious young man, who changes the life of the spirited and cheerful young woman. Albert wants Victoria to become more responsible and a bit less frivolous, and he reminds her of the harsh reality of how her least fortunate subjects have to live (she had previously not really opened her eyes to their situation). But despite a few arguments, there's an obvious attraction between them. And within only a few days, they're engaged to be married.
</li><li> Ygritte on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> is this for Jon.

Jon was a virgin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">sworn to celibacy</a>, but Ygritte pursued in anyway and finally seduced him. Most often she tells him he "knows nothing", yet ironically she mistook a windmill for a castle because she had never seen either. Through Jon's time with Ygritte he is able to experience the real world and learn vital lessons that aid his rise to power later. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ygritte is a dark subversion because their relationship ends in tragedy.</span>
<ul><li> Margaery is this for both Sansa and Joffrey, and later Tommen. When she comes to King's Landing, her quirky sense of humour and endless kindness helps Sansa gain some measure of happiness during her time as the Lannisters' royal hostage, while her 'quirky' interest in charity baffles Joffrey and keeps his attention. This is deliberately invoked on her part, as Margaery has no real interest in Joffrey, and is disturbed by his sociopathy and cruelty, but she plays along all so she can seduce him and become queen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When her grandmother has Joffrey killed to protect Margaery, she immediately switches to pulling this for Tommen, which unfortunately leads to his mother having Margaery killed and Tommen is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> in grief.</span>

But while the trope is still deconstructed in terms of their relationship (she tries to break up with him because being in love tends to trigger her unhealthy tendencies, which actually happens when she ends up stalking his father in an attempt to make him happy), it's also reconstructed - her being borderline doesn't make her unworthy of love or incapable of bringing people happiness, and she really does manage to tear down some of his emotional walls and bring some joy to his life.

When she brightens Jafar's life, it's a deliberate (and skillfully clever) effort on her part rather than just her innate quirkiness, and when Jafar falls in love with her, it's because her argument for the value of magic is logical and well-reasoned enough to convince him of her worth, even if he never actually adopts her viewpoint on it.

She both lampshades and deconstructs the trope as you continue playing and more backstory comes along: Violet admits that a lot of their problems come from the fact that she <em>can't</em> just be the protagonist's funny little girlfriend all the time, that she is also a real person with real hopes and desires and she's getting tired of putting her life on hold waiting for the protagonist to finish the work s/he was supposed to finish ages ago.
</li><li> Also of note is that the character we know as "Violet" is really just the way the protagonist imagines her voice in his/her head. So it's an even bigger deconstruction, because the story focuses purely on how she's viewed, not on what she actually does.

</li><li> Rinoa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> is a subversion: she comes off as a classic Manic Pixie Dream Girl at first when she's playfully urging Squall to dance at the SeeD graduation ball, and while it soon becomes clear that she does in fact have her own problems as a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> against the Galbadian occupation of Timber, she has much more well-meaning enthusiasm and optimism than she has the skill and experience needed to follow through with her big plans. However, she gets a rude awakening as to just how high the stakes are by the end of the first disc, and while she continues to encourage Squall to open up to her and others throughout the game, it's no longer in the manner of this trope.

Perhaps not the typical variation in that there are some...rather important other concerns as well, but she seems to tie just about everything back to her unrequited crush on Emil. She also works as a Deconstruction of one, as her love for Emil and attempts to better his personality only work in making Emil more annoyed. So by trying to be the girl who can change the cynical shy boy with no friends, she instead ends up driving him away and worsening their relationship. It doesn't help that until her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, she doesn't acknowledge Emil's real personality and is really imposing her own heroic views onto him.

He starts out completely cold, withdrawn, and mistrustful, but by the end of the future arc Pascal has completely worn him down with her friendliness and wacky charm, and around her he's either a stammering dork, an aspiring romantic, or a knight in shining armor, depending on the context. It's a last minute subversion, though, because she has no idea about his feelings for her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even once he pretty explicitly tells her he's in love with her</span>. It's hinted she might return his feelings, but they're stuck with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a>.

However, she does have a number of her own problems, not the least of which is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's only pretending to be this type of character because in reality, she's just as shy and lonely as Neku</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, the female protagonist has some elements of this in her relationship with Shinjiro Aragaki. It's most evident in about the eighth rank of his Social Link; having previously thrown a party for the rest of the dorm at the protagonist's instigation, he reflects on how good it felt and how he wouldn't have done it if it hadn't been for her influence; by the end of the game she has given him a new lease on life, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only to herself die as a result of performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a></span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> the second-gen Kitsune, Selkie, serves as this to the more dour guys, such as Dwyer and Ignatius. She constantly tries to drag them places and get them to enjoy life.
<ul><li> Elise is an interesting case in that, while naturally an upbeat and outgoing person, there are times when it's implied that she's deliberately exaggerating these traits in order to be a soothing presence for her more jaded siblings. The trope is played a little bit straighter in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her supports with Ryoma and Takumi</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tidus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> is a rare male protagonist example for Yuna. He came into her life out of nowhere when she's about to go on a pilgrimage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that will more or less make her a glorified human sacrifice</span>, and his cheerful and somewhat goofy outlook and his tendency to keep asking questions about parts of her culture that she just took for granted helps her grow as a person. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's also a literal dream boy.</span>
</li><li> Merrill from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">quirky</a>, innocent, endearingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteClumsyGirl">awkward and clumsy</a> and probably the most optimistic companion, nearly always cheerful and friendly.

However, her character development and very concrete goals outside of Hawke (which she will accomplish with or without Hawke's help) ultimately save her from this trope.

Sonic himself fits the manic pixie type well minus the relationship: he's a free spirit constantly on the lookout for the next adventure, most of the other characters look up to him for that reason, and he convinces others to live life to the fullest. The latter is most apparent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheBlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAndTheBlackKnight">Sonic and the Black Knight</a></em>, where the villain's motives go against his life philosophy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3">M&eacute;nage &agrave; 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zii fits the pattern. Irresponsible, almost always "up", and easily distracted, she has left a trail of hurt feelings and disrupted relationships behind her. Despite that, her interactions with Gary, DiDi, and Sonya have shaken them all out of assorted ruts and induced them to try something different, while Erik seems to have had something of a romantic MPDG image of her. Things get more complicated with and for her as the comic goes on, and the consequences of her manic pixie irresponsibility sometimes come back to bite her; notably, while she was only looking for a short-term fling with Sonya, Sonya has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">infatuated with her</a>.
</li><li> Gary is something of an MPDG magnet. After Yuki has split up with him, Sonya gives him a crash course in basic sexual activity, but turns out to be more interested in pursuing Zii for MPDG services. But shortly after that relationship ends, Senna crashes through his door, tells him a series of colorful lies, and drags him off to Paris by way of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileHighClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MileHighClub">Mile-High Club</a>. Mind you, Senna is more of a dangerously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">narcissistic</a> flake than true MPDG material. Gary's big problem in all this, though, is that he's far too passive to learn any useful lessons about life and love from any of them.
</li></ul></li><li> Roomie and Lillian from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GoGetARoomie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GoGetARoomie">Go Get a Roomie!</a></em> would seem to fit the trope, the former being promiscuous, usually drunk, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl">teasing everyone</a> and the latter being solitary, sheltered, and emotionless. That said, the trope itself is in equal parts downplayed, deconstructed, and <em>inverted</em>. Neither Lillian nor Roomie is shown as really <em>happy</em> with their role, and both end up changing their lives after making friends with the other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When they become a couple, Roomie is struck with crippling anxiety that she can't live up to the person Lillian thinks she is.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ellen invokes this trope intentionally to differentiate herself from the rather-straitlaced Elliot. Non romantic example, as she is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a>, and they see each other as more like brother and sister.

</li><li> Grace can be like this to Tedd, especially in the "One Way Road" arc where he's gotten too wrapped up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a> to the detriment of his friendships and social life.
</li><li> Ashley is a strong example of this trope, appearing shortly after Elliot's breakup with Sarah, and generally serving little plot importance but to help Elliot avoid dealing with emotional distress.

Interestingly, this seems to be a personality she developed purely to get Otra. Before her, she was a very cultured, dull and incredibly selfish girl. In other words, <em>Otra</em> played this role for <em>Winter</em> while having none of the personality normally involved with it.

He plays the manic pixie role toward her, but aside from the fact that their relationship is entirely platonic (Dillon being very, very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBestFriend">gay</a>), Ruby has just as much of an effect on Dillon, making him consider the consequences of his actions more, as he does on her.

Where he was constantly trying to put himself down and had a terrible home life, in comes Aurora, who makes his day a little brighter and becomes what the author described as a "happy pill" for him. Then it turns out his fixation on her presence making him happy turns into an obsession, and over time the story makes it clear that she has her own wants and needs as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That, and their coupling isn't healthy for themselves <em>or</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">the Earth</a>.</span>

A middle-aged married man in a suit meets an exasperated prostitute in a hotel room. Instead of sex, he asks her to role play: "I want you to turn my life upside down with your whimsical joie de vivre," &mdash; an act she finds "demeaning."

Turns out most manic pixies need to be eventually institutionalised. Kyle's heart is breaking as he has to have his wife Katie committed. She's adorable in a quirky and awkward way... but she wanders and marvels at <em>everything</em>, can't feed herself (she only ever eats pancakes), wants to pay in buttons, listens to music with unplugged headphones, blows kisses to people she doesn't know etc. All the manic-pixies at the facility are similar: they all listen to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a></em>, they fight over a CD mix which to them is like catnip to cats, they talk about star-gazing, get crafty with pipe clears and dance happily in the rain. The woman in charge handling Katie's case says the Manic Pixie Dream Girl condition is still dimly understood, but she has her own theory: severe retardation of the brain.

Bear has decided that he and Gemma need a man and that Gemma overall just needs some more spice in her life! Unfortunately, he mostly causes trouble and makes things even more complicated.

Chance met his dream girl Simone who is beautiful, gentle, quirky, lovable and a manic-pixie-dream-girl up-to-eleven. He loves her, but being married to her is exhausting... She reassures and encourages her friends and random people to follow their hearts or to keep pursuing their passions like music; people admire her ukulele skills and her singing; she likes to pretend to be an alien or a baby, she keeps throwing dinners with a theme (like an under sea dinner party for Chance and her, and their pet fish Morrissy insisted to join them, too), she loves making music mixes for her husband, she doesn't like 'dangerous chemicals' (even medicine, because pharmaceutical companies are evil), she works for a charity dressed as a dancing potted flower... and so on and so forth. She's very loving and inspiring, but Chance becomes extremely tired from her various adventures and her attempts to self-actualize him all the time, and to his horror, he starts to feel attracted to a firm, energetic and funny woman who acts like a grown-up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that Simone actually acts this way because Chance needs to be cheered up all the time, and others expect her to behave in that way, too.</span>
