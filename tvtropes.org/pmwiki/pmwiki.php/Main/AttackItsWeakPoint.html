However, the first boss in the first game &mdash; Chariot &mdash; subverts this just a tad by having its armor blown off when its health gets down to a third, allowing you to fire at the soft, pink body underneath anywhere you wish.
<ul><li> This is also the in-game manual's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for why agents in the spinoff/parody <em>Typing of the Dead</em> are running around wearing keyboard-guns &mdash; the typing feeds into an autotargeting mechanism which eliminates all risk of friendly fire and automatically discovers and isolates weak spots in targets.

<ul><li> In general, the series uses this trope liberally. Just about the only boss that <em>isn't</em> hit for massive damage is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Ridley</a>, with whom the only strategy is "make him dead before he makes you dead". And even then it only applies sometimes &mdash; Meta-Ridley always has at least one form that can't be damaged unless you aim for his torso. Omega Pirate from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> inverts this: He has no specific weak spots, but before you can harm him you have to first blast away his armour (so in essence you attack his strong points).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em>: Blob throwers must be destroyed from the top down, unless Samus is using the ice or wave beams. It counters by throwing floating "blobs" to try and stop her from getting above it.
</li><li> Hilariously in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> game, there's a rock monster boss that looks almost exactly like the one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">Galaxy Quest</a></em>. You must use the thermal visor in order to find his weak spot (a random piece of rock that changes after he takes enough damage).
</li><li> The various Metroid metamorphoses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a></em> are only vulnerable from their exposed belly nuclei, a crucial change from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidIIReturnOfSamus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a></em> where they could be shot anywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> The bosses in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RType">R-Type</a></em> used this system, and the third level took it to extremes by featuring just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleshipRaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleshipRaid">a single, giant enemy</a> with a number of weak points; the player had to pilot his ship around the boss itself, blowing up each part in turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>
<ul><li> Late in the game there is a boss called the Son of the Sun, who is a giant eyeball surrounded by a ring of flames. You can only attack the surrounding flames, and all but one will take no damage and counterattack when hit. The one that you can hit to actually damage the boss looks exactly the same as the others, and is only identifiable through trial-and-error. To make this worse, it uses an attack called "Roulette Shuffle" that spins the flames around so the one you attack is in a completely different area.
</li><li> Subverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>'s final boss, Lavos, who appears to be a humanoid figure flanked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">biological orbs</a>. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "Lavos Core" is actually one of the orbs, while the humanoid is just a drone that regenerates like the other orb</span>. Many parties die before finally discovering this crucial fact.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> features normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> that work like this. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounter">Random Encounters</a> in Cleyra include sand-elementals where you actively need to target a little, pink heart-like part of it.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em> series is fond of this, often in the obviously-glowing-red variation. Of particular note is one boss in <em>Star Fox Command</em> whose weak point is essentially a giant glowing <em>butt</em>. The enemy forces are mainly apes and monkeys, you see, and this boss is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> baboon.
<ul><li> Peppy basically makes this trope. "Aim for his back!" "Aim for the open spot!" "Maybe it's an arm! Aim for the arm!" "Shoot the tentacles to open the core!"
</li><li> The series also features some subversions, though. Andross is the eye type, but shooting his eyes only stuns him briefly. To defeat him, the player has to first shoot his hands off, then shoot the head anywhere BUT the eyes. On the right route, he then reveals his true form: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">a giant brain with detachable eyeballs that shoot lasers</a>, whose sole weak spot is the cerebellum.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPlanet">Lost Planet</a></em> takes this to the extreme. <em>Every single</em> Akrid&mdash;from the weakest cannon fodder all the way up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>&mdash;has orange weak points.

<ul><li> The majority of the Heaven's Smiles have a glowing yellow spot somewhere on their body. Shooting this kills them instantly and grants you far more blood (used to heal and for power-ups) than gunning them down the standard way. Heaven's Smiles without the yellow spot have similar vulnerabilities &mdash; the enlarged part of a Phantom Smile, the eye of a Giant Smile, the shirt on an Ulmeyda Smile, the cockpit on the part of it's body that looks like a jet that it uses to fly around...
</li><li> Most comical is the Ceramic smile boss, a big hulking monster of a smile that runs fairly quickly. Just shoot his heart through the convenient hole in his chest once. At least he has the sense to turn tail and run when you have your gun pointed at him.
</li></ul></li><li> Traditionally, the only way to harm Dracula's first form in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> games is to hit him in the head.
<ul><li> Later on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a></em>, there is the giant mecha-centaur demon knight (well, at least it's original) called Eligor. To kill him, you have to attack his eyeball, which is for some reason on the back of his head. The only way to actually be able to damage him is to get onto his back, and getting there requires destroying a number of glowing red orbs on his knees first.
</li></ul></li><li> In a few boss battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves">Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves</a></em>, particularly those fought in Sly's biplane or with Dimitri's speargun, the weak point is Dr. M, who is connected to the boss monster via the massive plug in his head.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> 2</em>, the Icon of Sin, has you firing rockets into the brain of the Icon. When using the idclip cheat, however, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">go into the brain and see...</a> John Romero's severed head impaled on a stick. Also, if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalSeduction">reverse what the demon chants</a> at the start of the battle, you'll hear the message "To win the game you must kill me, John Romero!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefIITheMetalAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefIITheMetalAge">Thief II: The Metal Age</a></em>, both the larger and smaller versions of the "Children of Karras" have a glowing-red coal hatch on the rear of their boilers. Unless you have an implausibly large amount of fire arrows or explosive mines available, hitting that coal hatch with water arrows is the only way in the game to disable one. Humorously, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in-game by an engineer's report asking what the hell the designer was thinking leaving the boiler so exposed like that, especially in a world where Water Arrows are well-known tools, and saying they really need to fix that ASAP.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The "headshot=death" rule has become more-or-less universal, providing players with an intuitive, sensible advanced technique for dispatching foes. Famously, completing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games on the punishing "Legendary" difficulty requires a mastery of it.
<ul><li> This was avoided, though, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> (for every class besides Sniper, anyway), which deliberately removed them (and replaced them with more-or-less random criticals) because the developers felt that headshots rewarded obsessive players at the expense of casual gamers and were unfriendly to team play.
</li><li> Also avoided in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a></em>. The in-universe justification is apparently that the Auraxian factions were smart enough to give their soldiers durable enough helmets to take your average rifle round without causing more damage than a body-shot. The sniper rifle takes off 75% of your average armored grunt's HP in one shot no matter where you hit, anyway. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24k7k');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24k7k" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24k7k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <em>real</em> reason?

Their boss apparently sucked at both of them, and after getting killed hundreds upon hundreds of times with headshots, he insisted that there be no headshots in their game.</span>
</li><li> On the flip side, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearOnline">Metal Gear Online</a></em> (at least the version packaged with MGS4) has an in-game option in which players hosting a match can decide to enable a "Headshots Only" mode, in which you're penalized if you shoot an opposing player anywhere but their head.

One Terminator-like robot boss sports a huge flashing red button on his back reading "Do Not Push."

</li><li> <em>ZX Advent</em> plays this straight enough, since Model A copies the bosses' DNA at the same quality no matter how hard you bang on weak points. Some bosses don't have any weak points, however, and just need to be hammered on the old-fashioned way.
<ul><li> Interesting to note that Model H can use the lower screen to display the enemy's/boss' weak point and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> (the latter is pretty much useless against bosses who show it anyway though). You can figure out the bosses' weak points even without Model H, as they make a special and different sound when you hit them.

That also applies to the nearly omnipresent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Sigma, who most often has his head or the gem on his forehead being the weakness.

Therefore the only part of the mecha which isn't practically invincible is the target-shaped box of sensors sticking off the side, without which the pilot is deaf and blind. This forces the pilot to open up the cockpit in order to see what he is doing, leaving the controls vulnerable to your missiles. Strangely, the weakest part of the cockpit is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">the guy sitting in it</a>.

</li><li> All fighters are obviously vulnerable to a hard right hook, but Glass Joe is especially weak, getting knocked out by one punch.
</li></ul></li><li> It's hard to notice, but this is actually subverted in the PC version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry1">Far Cry 1</a></em>. The large, glowing green orbs in the chests of the rocket launcher-wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mooks</a> are actually <em>part of their armor</em>, and they actually take <em>less</em> damage when shot there. Their real weak point is, common-sensibly enough, their head.
<ul><li> Played straight, but in a fairly tongue-in-cheek manner, for the final boss. He's a super-mutant with loads of health, but he can be killed in less than a second by shooting him in the crotch (something of an Easter egg, as there is no in-game indication that shooting him there would have that effect).
</li></ul></li><li> Beowulf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a> 3</em> can be struck in his eye for greater damage than attacking the rest of his body. If Dante or Vergil lowers his health to the points where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a> by hitting the eye, Beowulf will stumble and give a few more vital seconds for dealing damage. Cerberus from the same takes more damage from getting hit on either of his three heads. The Leviathan Heartcore, also from the same, needs to have its two accompanying "organs" destroyed before it opens up and makes itself vulnerable.
<ul><li> In the original, Phantom could only be hurt by strikes to the face (high damage, but that's where he shoots fireballs from), and back (less damage, but less risk). Nightmare had a weakpoint that you had to expose by first solidifying it, then smashing the glowy circle.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a> 2</em> is covered by a force field in the front, and thus can only be hit from the rear. Worse, unless you happen to be cloaked, he will always turn to face you. You're meant to detonate a multi-warhead missile on a wall behind him, causing the secondary warheads to hit his weak spot. Didn't stockpile enough Earthshaker missiles ahead of time? You're screwed.
<ul><li> It <em>is</em> possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasingYourTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasingYourTail">slide around behind him</a> if you get in close, but it's still very tough and only nets you a split-second chance at hitting the weak spot. Afterburners can help with this too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> has plenty of examples that aren't just the usual "shoot head for max damage" ones:
<ul><li> Hunters have strong armor covering most of their bodies. The weak points are the back, which is bigger and generally easier to go after, especially on co-op, and under the chin, which is much harder to hit but has the advantage of being accessible while they're facing you.
</li><li> If you shoot the infection form inside the Flood combat forms (they're located in the part of the chest where the sensory tentacles are sticking out), they take more damage, or die in one hit if you have the right weapon.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank">Scarab</a>'s weak point is a reactor core hidden in the center of its platform. Common strategies include using a aerial vehicle (or in the case of the Scarab in New Mombasa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, a ledge above it) to land on its platform to get to the reactor core, or in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, firing at its legs until it lowers itself so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">it can be climbed</a>.
</li><li> Some vehicles have weak spots that you can hit for extra damage, with examples including the Ghost's left-side fuel cell and the Wraith's rear-end exhaust port.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em>, the Promethean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Knights</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Soldiers</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss">the Warden Eternal</a>, will expose big glowing weak spots (or in the Warden's case, a big dark one) once you knock off enough of their armor.
</li><li> Also from <em>Halo 5</em>, the Grunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Goblin</a> has weak spots on its front and back that can be exposed if you knock off the armor covering them.
</li></ul></li><li> Although nearly all bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures">Rocket Knight Adventures</a></em> (with the exception of Axel Gear) follow this trope, the third boss in the first game displays an interesting variant. The boss is a fish-shaped submarine-like vehicle partially submerged in lava, and the vehicle itself is completely invulnerable. The only way to deal damage is to wait until the rare occasions when the pilot is exposed and attack <em>him</em>.
</li><li> The Bosses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetIsland">Jet Island</a> have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal">Power Crystal</a> that must be attacked to destroy them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The anime's issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">New Powers as the Plot Demands</a> aside, Parasect doesn't have just a double weakness to Flying and Fire, but in Generation IV, potentially a <em>triple</em> weakness to Fire if it has the Dry Skin ability.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder">Shedinja</a> takes it even further, with its special ability. Only super-effective attacks or indirect damage (poison, weather) will work at all, but it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfDiminishingDefensiveEffort">guaranteed KO</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tanks in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> games take realistic damage; shooting rockets to the front of the tank does minimal damage, more damage to the sides, and the most damage to the back. Smart players with this knowledge will always try to flank around to the back of the tank rather than take it head on.
<ul><li> The battlewalkers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142">Battlefield 2142</a></em> can shrug off most everything short of a suicidal transport pilot. However, there is a flimsy vent underneath that potentially allows someone with a pistol to inflict massive damage. The Titan supercarriers present a similar situation: they can only be damaged from outside by BLOC-3 missiles, but can be infiltrated to get to its creamy nuclear core.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost every enemy you encounter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em>, although how you are supposed to hit them is a bit different. Headshots are a joke in this game, instead you must shoot their limbs (hands, legs, tails, tentacles). The big ones even have their joints explicitly shown to the players. Exploders even have <em>two</em> weak points: their explosive pustule and its joint with the shoulder. Bosses and mini-bosses have big yellowish pustules that you should obviously know what to do with them. The "almost" part in this case are the Swarmers, which die in one hit no matter where you hit them, and Dividers, which do not have a weak point.
<ul><li> New enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpaceExtraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpaceExtraction">Dead Space: Extraction</a></em> still follow this trend. Some of them are untransformed humans, and they too have a weak spot: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">the head</a>, obviously.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> powered tanks generate huge amounts of waste heat, and need radiators to avert a catastrophic heat explosion. Aim for the radiators, and anti-tank Lances will likely take them down in a single blow &mdash; two if it's a heavy tank. Even otherwise useless anti-infantry firearms will deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to the radiator. Only two tanks in the entire game are capable of hiding their radiators &mdash; one of which only needs to expose them after firing the main cannon, one of which needs constant supporting repairs from nearby allied bases.
<ul><li> It's also possible to headshot infantry units for greater damage at the cost of lower accuracy versus hitting center mass. While both of these apply toward both ally and enemy forces, enemies will never intentionally target the head (while they'll constantly attempt to exploit the tank radiator for all it's worth).
</li><li> The final battle against the Marmota, a massive land battleship, is mostly hitting a series of different weakpoints in order to get at the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> it's outfitted with. First the player shoots at a huge gaping hole in the hull left when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Alicia</span> used her Valkyria powers to hurl a Valkyria lance through it, which creates a convenient ramp of scrap metal for infantry units to climb up and disable a pair of hidden radiators powering a shield surrounding the mounted superweapon, allowing it to be attacked directly.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to its logical extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>. Although no boss in the game has a specific weak point, all of them have parts that are weaker or stronger against player attack. Further, depending on the method of attack used, the weak points may be different (some parts are weak against blunt force but resistant to damage from edged weapons, for instance). Each part of their body also takes a varying amount of damage from the different elements. Properly exploiting these weaknesses can easily make the difference between a hunt taking close to the usual time limit of 50 minutes or less than half that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Zone of the Enders</a>: the Second Runner</em> does this at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleshipRaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleshipRaid">Battleship Raid</a>. Jehuty has to destroy them, and can go about this in a few ways: find and destroy every destructible piece of paneling and weapon on the ships, use the Vector Cannon to hit their generators, or (related to the last one) line up the Vector Cannon and fire at them to blow them up with just sheer damage. To be fair, the generators are protected by a shield of compressed space, and normal weapons do no damage to them; if you can hit the generators, you've got enough firepower to take down the ship through pure damage anyway.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onimusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onimusha">Onimusha</a></em> games, scoring a counter-hit on an enemy during a narrow window of opportunity will have the screen flash bright yellow as your current character (usually) delivers a lunging slash. This will instantly destroy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> and inflict Massive Damage against Boss characters, and in the case of characters equipped with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon">Ogre Gauntlet</a> result in a much higher Soul payoff than normal.
</li><li> Tank crews in the World War II MMOFPS <em>Battleground Europe</em> (a.k.a. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldWarIIOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldWarIIOnline">World War II Online</a></em>) pretty much have to know the weaknesses of every tank type they might possibly come up against, because the game tries to realistically model armor penetration. Trying to pound away at the front armor of a Panzer MIGHT work, but it's far less dangerous to aim for exhaust vents, the cupola, or anything else with thin armor. If you are driving a vehicle (or pushing an anti-tank gun) with small caliber shells, this might be the only way you will ever damage them at all. Then, of course, your gunner could very well get shot in the neck by an infantryman because you forgot to close the hatch.
<ul><li> The same occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarThunder">War Thunder</a></em> Ground Forces, aiming for specific parts of the tanks is essential. This includes the view slits for the crew, ammo or fuel storage for a quick kill, but also the engine, transmission (getting stuck in reverse) tracks, or the turret to keep the enemy tank from firing or escaping.
</li></ul></li><li> Dark Maker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em> have multiple weakspots on their limbs, each of which can take a moderate amount of damage, then becomes invulnerable.

</li><li> If ever a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> game appears in which not a <em>single</em> boss uses this, it will be proof that the developers have been kidnapped and are being held hostage somewhere. Ever since the first boss of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">the first game</a> (which was only vulnerable on its horn), its been making use of this. It especially likes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">Go for the Eye</a> variant, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">making you figure out how to expose said weak point.</a>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em> has the enemies named "Horsehead" and "Helmethead". Guess where you need to strike? Inverted with Gooma, a boss added to the international releases in place of a second battle with Helmethead, whose weak point is his body and, in contrast to the boss he replaced, whose head is invulnerable.
</li><li> The Moldorm's tail in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>A Link to the Past</em> also has Helmasaur King, the Boss of the Dark Palace. Link has to aim for the green crystal on its forehead, which it protects with a mask.
</li><li> Trinexx, the Boss of Turtle Rock in <em>A Link to the Past</em>. In the second phase of the battle, Link has to attack its glowing midsection.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em> was chock full of this. Gohma had her eye, Barinade had his soft skin under his jellyfish armor, Morpha had its nucleus, Bongo Bongo had its eye (which was exposed once you attacked both of its other weak points), and Ganon had his bright blue tail.
</li><li> There's a particularly fun (if easy) variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</a></em> involving whacking a seesaw with the hammer in order to reach the giant golem Eox's weak point.
</li><li> The eyes of Diababa, Morpheel and Armogohma, the jewel on Fyrus's head, the Twilight Sword in Stallord's head, and the open point in Argorok's armor (on its back), the third battle with Zant has his shoes, and Beast Ganon had his underbelly, all from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>.
<ul><li> Beast Ganon's weakness is caused by a wound on his stomach which extends to his humanoid form.
</li></ul></li><li> Various bosses and enemies use this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>, often with the added twist of only being vulnerable from a certain angle, requiring the player to time and angle their attack <em>just</em> right in order to actually hit it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> uses this trope the least of any game in the series, though it is still present. The individual dungeon bosses, Guardians and Hinox all have weak points that can be exploited (as do the Lynels, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">though they aren't technically boss enemies themselves</a>), but the open-ended nature of the combat means they will still take damage and can be fought without utilizing the weak spots if the player goes in with the right equipment. Only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockMonster">Talus</a> minibosses and the final boss require hitting weak points to deal damage at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>, enemy officers have attacks that will leave them vulnerable, indicated by a Weak Point Gauge over their heads. Attack them while the gauge is up to deplete it, and when it's empty the player character will perform a unique attack for a lot of damage.
</li></ul></li><li> The Factory boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a></em> is only vulnerable at its "core," which it protects with a metal grate. Luckily, its legs aren't so well-protected, and if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead">Use Your Head</a>, figuring out how to knock him over isn't so tough.
</li><li> The third boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SphinxAndTheCursedMummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SphinxAndTheCursedMummy">Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy</a></em> has a rather obvious "heart lid" on its chest to attack, but it keeps it closed most of the time. (And anyway, it's out of the reach of your sword anyway.) However, you are capable of <em>throwing</em> things that high... and indeed, you have to throw rocks at him to make him expose his weak point. Harder than it sounds&mdash;he's <em>reeeeaally</em> fast, and you when burdened by a rock? Not so much.
</li><li> Numerous bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em> are only truly vulnerable at one point on their body. The most notable is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButcher">The Butcher</a> &mdash; the only part of his <em>massive</em> body that's vulnerable is his head, and even then, it's too high to reach normally <em>or</em> hit with ranged attacks. In round one, you can climb up his arms when he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">a certain attack</a>, but in round two, you have to throw telekinetic projectiles at him when he does the same attack. And he's <em>much</em> faster now.
</li><li> The first boss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em> can be attacked, but you can't truly <em>harm</em> him not matter how much you whack his tail with a stick. In fact, he's so tough, he can only be hurt from within. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb">Feed him explosives?</a> No! Do enough damage so he gets annoyed and tries to eat you, silly!
<ul><li> There's a normal, area-specific enemy that can only be hurt on a spot on its back. Circle-strafe all you want; it'll keep up. You have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hit it with a Ground Quake</span> to make it turn around so you can hit it on its back.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> games have this all over the place. All mechs (including your own) have much weaker armor in the rear than they do in front; this doesn't really matter much when you're in an assault mech picking off light ones, since they pretty much die like flies either way. However, when <em>you</em> are in a small/medium mech, or a big one that's taken a lot of damage, and the radar cheerfully bleeps and tells you an enemy 100-ton behemoth is heading your way, the rear weak spot suddenly becomes a lot more important, because targeting it is the only way (barring sheer luck with critical strikes or a particularly incompetent enemy) to survive the encounter.
<ul><li> Since they usually always face you, the leg are also always weak points on a mech, destroying them also permit to salvage the mech, very useful to capture the heavy armed 100-ton battlemech. Putting together enough precision weapons like lasers, autocannons, Gauss guns, or missiles with targeting computers to quickly destroy their leg is a damn good tactic.
</li><li> The "weaker rear armor" bit is taken straight from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">board game</a>; the torso locations can each only have so much armor altogether and attacks coming in through will strike the front, so that's the side that gets the lion's share of the armor and the rear is left comparatively vulnerable to a determined attacker who can get there. Beyond that, actual aimed shots tend to be fairly rare because even with an advanced targeting computer success at hitting the chosen spot isn't guaranteed <em>and</em> the overall chance to hit in the first place goes down, and without try are pretty much limited to immobile targets and/or the occasional melee attack.
</li><li> The weakest part of any 'Mech is the head (aka the cockpit), which has such low armor that one good hit will probably destroy it instantly. The issue here is that the head is <em>really</em> small and damned near impossible to deliberately hit on a moving 'Mech, so headshots tend to be the result of pure luck or an <em>extremely</em> stupid pilot sitting completely still and giving you the chance to line up such a shot.
<ul><li> Striking the cockpit is also an excellent way to get relatively-intact mechs for salvage, as any hit there that gets through is liable to reduce the pilot to little more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">Ludicrous Gibs</a> given the firepower of most battlemech weaponry. Even if they survive (either by luck, or due to a weak weapon like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">MG Array</a>) they might panic and eject; and if they don't, injuries will still reduce pilot performance/mech effectiveness.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> All forms of Chaos (except 6 which requires that you get him into a specific state... of matter) require that you attack his brain. This is fairly easy the first two times with Chaos 0, and then he starts jumping around on lampposts and punching at you, and you have to wait until he comes down, at which point he's easy again. 2 makes you wait until he misses a punch and freezes in place a couple of seconds, while 4 has to surface and float in place before you can attack him there. Perfect pretty much makes you have a minimum speed so that when you get to him, you spiral up the inside and hit his brain. If you're not going fast enough, you're just ejected and have to find him again. Actually, you could almost make a case for 6's weak spot being Froggy, at least in Big's version: once Big lands him, he wins.
</li><li> The Egg vehicles have the cockpit as the weak point. The Hornet stays at bay and shoots small missiles at you, then tries to drill you into the ground. If he misses, there's your chance. The Walker makes you play Simon Says (sort of) with its ankle joints; one, two, or three of the feet stomp, sending out a shockwave which you want to avoid, but also making that joint vulnerable to brief malfunction if you jump near it. If all the glowing joints malfunction, that brings the cockpit down for semi-easy pickings. (You can hit its underside this time.) The Viper, the first three times, from time to time shows its belly, trying to lure Sonic in with a path to the cockpit while it's charging its (other) laser, which it will fire if you don't hit the cockpit in time. Then you have to wait until it yo-yos spinning spiked discs at you so you can jump on one and use it to reach Eggman.
</li><li> Zero, whom Amy is fleeing throughout her stages, is only vulnerable once Amy knocks him into the electric fencing surrounding the boss stage. This causes him to flip his top, exposing a button which you then attack.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Boss GUN vehicles, much like Egg vehicles, are only vulnerable in the cockpit. How easy they are to get to varies.
</li><li> The Biolizard has a tank on its back which you have to attack. To reach it, however, you have to wait until it's tired from chomping at you and shooting balls of dark energy at you. Then you can grind up the rail that begins at its mouth, and then you can attack.
</li><li> The Finalhazard. "Aim for the red swelling area to damage him!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em> has a notable Egg boss where it's weak point <em>ISN'T</em> the cockpit (it has none) &mdash; the Egg Emperor. It's weak point is the glowing orb in the middle of it's body with the slightly-hard-to-see-during-gameplay picture of Eggman on it. However, it's smart enough to protect itself with a giant shield. You have to either destroy the shield with a Power character, or temporarily paralyze the shield-arm with Thunder Shoot in order to do any damage.
<ul><li> Eggman's love for this trope ends up getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot">Fourth-Wall Mail Slot</a> event on the official Sonic twitter.

One boss in <em>Sexy Parodius</em> is a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tanuki">tanuki</a>, complete with arrows telling you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">what his weak point</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">isn't</a></em>.

<div class="indent"><strong>CT-01/425:</strong> Its durasteel plating is rated for starship hulls and is nearly invulnerable to small arms fire. Only its optical cluster, the red orb on its abdomen, is unshielded and vulnerable. <br><strong>Scorch:</strong> In other words, shoot the big red spot.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> features a quest in which you must defeat undead that are unkillable unless you destroy the crystals that keep them moving. These crystals become vulnerable only when the undead in question has taken enough damage that it would otherwise be defeated. (If you <em>don't</em> destroy the crystal then the undead, merely stunned instead of defeated, snaps out of it and resumes attacking even though it has 0 health.
<ul><li> This resulted in some hilarious griefing potential early in the game's run where the designers forgot to put a "leash" on the crystal-bound undead like most enemies have, forcing them to return to their normal area when lured too far away. Since they didn't have this, some players would pull the invincible undead all the way to a town or a major city, where they would slowly but inexorably murder any opponent, no matter how statistically outclassed they should have been. And the only way to stop it would either be a server reset or luring the undead all the way back to their crystal.
</li><li> Raigonn, the final boss of the Gate of the Setting Sun dungeon, is a slightly more traditional example, where players need to attack and destroy its weak spot &mdash; specifically named that, no less! &mdash; in order to break its armour before they can kill it.
</li><li> The Ulduar boss XT-002 Deconstructinator both plays the trope straight and subverts it. After damaging the boss enough, its mechanical heart will be exposed. The heart takes double damage and any damage done to the heart is mirrored to the boss. However, the heart has its own life meter, and if killed, it will actually make the boss STRONGER, causing him to heal, gain a damage boost, and gain new attacks. Ergo, unless the players were attempting to trigger this purposely (it was the Boss' hard mode trigger), it was best to only attack the weak point for a short amount of time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yw5i');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3yw5i" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yw5i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fortunately, the heart healed itself to full after every exposed/returned/exposed cycle.</span>

Blowing up the crystal causes the thing to self destruct in a massive explosion. Somewhat subverted in that these devices are far behind enemy lines, and were not expected to be attacked.
</li><li> In the original, the <em>Lucifer</em> had a reactor be destroyed, which would then blow up the ship. Like with the above example however, these reactors were never expected to be vulnerable &mdash; they powered off the massive energy shielding that normally renders the <em>Lucifer</em> completely impervious.

You have to take down her hands and her head for her to expose her heart, which is her weak point.
<ul><li> Earlier against Queen Bean you have to attack her arms to deflate them (She's HUGELY muscular) and to make her lose her crown on her head, cause you know, spikes hurt when jumping on it.
</li><li> Even more drawn out in the final battle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime">Partners in Time</a>, the second in the series. You have to attack her tentacle legs, which enables you to attack the crown which enables you to attack the boss herself. Oh, and the crown regenerates after a while, rendering any attack to her useless. And if that wasn't enough, the legs also regenerate, sometimes forcing you to do the whole thing again.
</li><li> The final boss of the third game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Bowser's Inside Story</a>, is even MORE complicated. You begin the fight as Bowser. After you've dealt a certain amount of damage the boss fully heals and grows big. Then you must punch his stomach to make him spit out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Dark Star core</span>. Then you must suck it into Bowser's stomach where Mario and Luigi take over.

His weak points are his legs and glasses, if you don't destroy the glasses first he will retract some of his legs while you are attacking. After killing his legs he will fall to the ground, revealing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Dark Star core</span>, the boss' REAL weak point. You have approximately two turns to damage it before it escapes, and you have to REPEAT THE ENTIRE PROCESS untill he FINALLY dies. Phew.

</div></li><li> The basis of <em>Blood of Bahamut</em>. The giant monsters that are the game's entire basis can only be damaged at their Cores (if you hit anywhere else, damage is along single-digit lines). Indeed, some missions are entirely to remove armor over a Gargantuan's core before you can actually fight it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyOfTwo">Army of Two</a></em> has heavily armored enemies that can only be hurt from behind.

Shooting the lumps on a Scion's back can have the same stagger effect on top of dealing a pretty decent chunk of damage to the Scion. On higher levels in multiplayer, knowing this is essential.
</li><li> Surprisingly enough, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McNinja">Phantom's</a> sword is the weakpoint. Hitting it with a surprisingly small number of rounds will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastingItOutOfTheirHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlastingItOutOfTheirHands">shatter the weapon</a>, forcing them to back off and use their hand blaster and depriving them of their one-hit-kill weapon. Good luck hitting it, though.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensVsPredator2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensVsPredator2010">Aliens vs. Predator (2010)</a></em>, to have a real chance of beating combat synths as the marine, you need to hit them in their weakpoint &mdash; their legs. No, really. Knocking off their head just blinds them and makes it harder for them to hit you, their torso can take absurd amounts of punishment, and although their arms would theoretically work too, they're too hard to hit in practice as they're holding guns. Aim for the legs.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Almost every enemy in the first game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1">Borderlands 1</a></em> has some body part that will take bonus damage when hit. Soft parts like head and eyes are common targets, as are underbellies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> features Loaders, a robotic enemy class with an uncommon yet logical weak point&mdash;their joints. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Just as in real life</a>, mechanical and electronic joints are more complex and often more delicate than the limb or body structures that they join and are more easily damaged by, say, a shotgun blast. More advanced Loaders, such as SGT's, armour their joints and are vulnerable only to eye shots.
</li><li> Assassin Zer0 has a ranged combat style entirely defined by these. The B0re upgrade, among other things, highlights weak points, and most of the Sniper tree buffs critical hit damage in one way or another. This can get particularly nasty with a Jakobs sniper rifle, which has a much higher damage multiplier against weak points than any other brand of gun.
</li><li> Actual <em>invulnerability</em> when not hit in a critical spot is pretty rare, however &mdash; the final boss of the "Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt" DLC exhibits it, and Crystalisk enemies are <em>almost</em> invincible when not hit on their giant shiny crystals (explosive rounds can damage their bodies, but unless you've already done a lot with critical hits it's going to take a very long time), but that's about it.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">Spoony's</a> review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Microcosm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Microcosm">Microcosm</a></em> describes the boss's weak points as "huge fuck-me lights".
</li><li> In another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> example, the Drones in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheConduit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheConduit">The Conduit</a></em> have huge red glowing orbs on their chest... but these are part of their armor and don't take more damage than anywhere else. Their weakpoint is, sensibly enough, their head &mdash; although they can still take more punishment there than a human.
</li><li> Enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResonanceOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResonanceOfFate">Resonance of Fate</a></em> tend to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CognizantLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CognizantLimbs">Cognizant Limbs</a> that absorb damage from a certain angle. Strong enemies and bosses can have heavily-armored parts covering most angles, but one or two lightly-armored angles that leave the main body open to attack.
<ul><li> And if you jump, your bullets hit random body parts. Shoot enough times with a submachine gun, and you will eventually almost completely fill up with scratch damage. Then, all you have to do is jump and attack with a direct damage weapon. No need to worry about pesky body parts after all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheKasai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheKasai">Rise of the Kasai</a></em> has a few bosses like this. Three take the form of dragons that fly around the platform and will breathe fire at you that will instantly kill you if it hits. They're far out of reach for most of the fight and can only be sniped by arrows right before breathing fire, and then will only take damage if the arrow hits a weak point on their chest. The final boss can be stunned, but not killed, by attacking it over and over again, however, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a> is floating right above it. Once again, arrow to that equals dead boss.
</li><li> In all of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope">Silent Scope</a></em> games, the boss's weak point is always the head. Certain vehicles also have weak points, like the rotor for a helicopter and the tires of a car. This is later subverted for laughs in the third game <em>Sogeki</em>, where the boss of Stage 3 has two. The first is obvious, his head. The second is not so obvious, his teddy bear. Shoot the teddy bear and he goes down. Though this is actually harder than it sounds, you have less than a second to shoot it when the chance presents itself.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In <em>Wing Commander III</em> and <em>Wing Commander IV</em>, shots aimed at the bridge or engines of a capship do an additional 50% damage, once the shields are penetrated.
</li><li> While the Kilrathi dreadnought in <em>Wing Commander III</em> isn't totally invulnerable, it's <em>much</em> more vulnerable when shooting at it inside the hangar, where there the fast-recharging shields don't protect, even compared to the extra damage given to targeting a capship's engines or bridge.
</li><li> In <em>Wing Commander IV</em>, the only way to kill the <em>Vesuvius</em> is to drop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Flashpak</a> in the hangar, where they don't use the quite effective armor found on the outer hull.
</li><li> Played realistically in <em>Prophecy</em> with killing capital ships. The majority of the ship is too heavily armored and shielded for fighters to destroy them with massed fire. Instead, you have to take down their shield generators and hit the critical subsystems: Bridge and Engines. Even with those destroyed, the ship doesn't explode as in most games... it's left dead in space, with occasional secondary explosions across the hull.
</li></ul></li><li> A couple of bosses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a>. Naval Piranha's only weak spot is a bandaged lump on its stem (presumably the "navel", although it looks more like an adam's apple). Eggs thrown at Sluggy the Unshaven just deform its outer shell without hurting it, but once its clearly-visible heart is exposed, it can be destroyed with a single strike. In both cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Kamek</a> draws your attention to this, in the first case by, bizarrely, calling Yoshi a "cutie without a navel", and in the second case by announcing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">This slug has no weak points!</a>"
<ul><li> Hookbill the Koopa is defeated by knocking him down then ground pounding his stomach.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bulletstorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a></em> has the usual weak spots &mdash; groin shots and headshots &mdash; but some fully mutated enemies have several glowing sacs of... um... stuff on their body. Shoot any of the sacs and the whole body will go up in a blast of orange bodily liquids. Also, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">plant boss</span> has several weak spots to hit before it recharges its hitpoints.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin2">Pikmin 2</a></em> has the Segmented Crawbster boss, which has to be tricked into rolling into a wall to reveal the weak spot on its belly. A non-boss example would be Anode Beetles from the same game, which can be flipped over simply by throwing a pikmin directly onto its back.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebGame">Web Game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pico">Pico</a>'s School</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Newgrounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a>, the only way to do damage to Casandra's monster form in the final battle is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">targeting the dangling genitalia</a> between her (or is that his?) legs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Goodstyle</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioMasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioMasterOfDisguise">Wario: Master of Disguise</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyWeapon">Heavy Weapon</a></em> has a few bosses like this. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleshipRaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleshipRaid">Battleship</a> is weak in the control tower, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEyeOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEyeOfDoom">Eyebot</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoForTheEye">vulnerable in the eye</a> when it is open, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SegmentedSerpent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SegmentedSerpent">Segmented Serpent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">Mechworm</a> was weak in the head.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>, the Shadyas are a type of smoke-like enemies with large, curved blades. The only way to kill them is to attack the large, red, glowing orb in their chests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTanx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTanx">BattleTanx</a></em> has the Rhino Tank, which is described as "A trainload of armor on front." You have to either use grenades or hit the tank from behind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsGundam">Dynasty Warriors: Gundam</a> 2</em> treats Mobile Armors like this: you have to strike them when and where they are vulnerable to do any damage at all. Thankfully the third game does away with this: in that Mobile Armors can be harmed at any time, but you do a lot more damage if you strike the weak points.
</li><li> Capital ships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TachyonTheFringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TachyonTheFringe">Tachyon: The Fringe</a></em> have destroyable subsystems. Take out the powerplant, it can't move. Destroy the weapons generator, it can't shoot. Blow up the shield generator, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> won't regenerate. There are occasions where time constraints make this mode of attack inadvisable, but they're rare.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> games have this all the time. The worst though are when the boss has a giant target basically painted on them, like the bandage on the Whomp King in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em>, the target on Topmaniac's head in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, or the glowing/coloured lights/symbols on Megahammer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>. In the Gobblegut fight in <em>Galaxy 2</em>, Bowser Jr warns Gobblegut to protect his "bellyache bulges". Just in case the player hadn't seen them...
</li><li> For the final fight against Omega Supreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron">Transformers: War for Cybertron</a></em>, you first have to attack his exposed turrets, which are explicitly stated to be outside of his shields. Destroy enough of them and his shields go down and his chest becomes the vulnerable spot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scaler">Scaler</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab">Rattlecrab</a> (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel">Unexpected Shmup Boss</a>) has four blue weak spots that glow red when it's going to attack. The first two are on its pincers, the third one is on its tail, and the fourth one is its mouth.
</li><li> Humanoid enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark2008">Alone in the Dark (2008)</a></em> can only be killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">igniting</a> the fissures on their bodies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem">Duke Nukem</a></em>, Atomic Edition, the Pig Cop riot tanks can take quite a lot of punishment and have an assortment of long and short-range weaponry. However, if you're quick enough to get behind them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">press the nuclear trefold</a> on the back, they self-destruct, leaving you with only the annoyed driver to deal with.
</li><li> The Brawlamari and Queen Buzzerfly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em> both have extremely conspicuous glowing orbs on their bodies that serve as the only points that can be struck to cause damage. It takes a little effort in order to get close enough to hit them, though.
</li><li> The naval portion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> introduces ship-to-ship battles. Your ship, the <em>Aquila</em>, can fire broadsides or use its smaller swivel cannons for precision targeting. The swivel cannons are usually only good against gunboats and are almost completely useless against bigger ships. However, if you damage a frigate enough with broadsides, this has a chance of exposing its powder magazine, which can be targeted with your swivel cannons for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterTheWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterTheWar">After The War</a></em>, the Worm bosses can only be damaged by hitting the head. First you have to stun them, then use your sword to remove the shell and finally kill it by shooting at the thing.
</li><li> The Nevi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GravityRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GravityRush">Gravity Rush</a></em> have large glowing cores that shatter when hit with a well-placed Gravity Kick. In the case of many of the larger Nevi, this is the only way to damage them.
</li><li> The final boss's first form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteDux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynamiteDux">Dynamite Dux</a></em> is composed of several spheres; its weak point is the ball <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Achacha</a> is riding.
</li><li> Hellbugs in the TV tie-in game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Defiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Defiance">Defiance</a> are in general heavily armored, but the different versions all have some weak spot. The smallest skitterlings die pretty easily, but the Warrior, the next size up has only the inside of its mouth and it only opens that when it's about to attack. Matriarchs have three; the mouth, their chest when they rear up to do a smash attack, and once they've done a roll-charge attack and are recovering, vanes open and temporarily expose a weak spot at the rear. The sound your gun makes when you're hitting one of these changes from the usual pings of ricocheting bullets to a sawtoothed grinding noise to let you know you've got the right place.
</li><li> All of the different types of Darkers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2">Phantasy Star Online 2</a></em> have a conspicuous red core located somewhere on their bodies that serves as a weak point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em> striking an enemy with a move it's weak against provides you with a temporary damage bonus that fades with time or once your combo ends. It's possible to exploit multiple weaknesses on the same enemy to increase strength and duration of the bonus.
<ul><li> This system returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia2">Tales of Xillia 2</a></em>, where it's even more crucial to combat, as bosses are unable to perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboBreaker">Combo Breaker</a> as long as the bonus is active (Something they'll do with annoyingly great frequency otherwise).

</li><li> Possibly some of the hardest enemies to defeat solo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackKnight">Trojans</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights">Spiral Knights</a> have a massive crystal in their back. They also have a shield, which unlike the player's shield can't be broken. Said shield is always up. Also, they hit like trucks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkySerpents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkySerpents">Sky Serpents</a></em>, the titular serpents have weak spots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">helpfully colored purple</a>. Sometimes they're inaccessible due to cover by scales, which like everything else but those purple spots are invulnerable to attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedOrchestra">Red Orchestra</a></em>, especially with the AT handguns, aiming for the ammo storage and the engine or fuel tanks is essential. Chances of penetrating front armor, even from short range is very low. In the sequel, it is possible to knock out the crew, so aiming for the armored glass also works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CopyKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CopyKitty">Copy Kitty</a></em>, attacking Yolomacho's head deals more damage as opposed to hitting its body. This is important to know because in hard mode, you'll be hard pressed to hit its back if you don't know its weak point.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gigant: Take-Mikazuchi</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronophantasma">BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma</a></em> has two weak points to hammer on, but neither are consistently vulnerable, and exposing one means hammering on the other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">First is the tongue, which serves as the main weapon; during one Distortion Drive, it will stick the cannon out and prepare to fire; attacking Take-Mikazuchi's head during this time causes damage to the tongue, and when enough damage has been issued, the Distortion will abort and cause it to fall over. Second is the core, exposed in precisely the aforementioned fashion; when the core falls into arm's reach is when the player dumps everything they've got into it, as it is much more sensitive to pain than anywhere else on its body.</span>
</li><li> Battleships in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration">SD Gundam G Generation</a></em> series take up multiple squares on the map (for example, 3x4 or 4x5) and can be attacked anywhere in that area. Attacking a flashing square that corresponds to the bridge or some other vital system causes a "Pinpoint Attack" that does twice as much damage as usual.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> has a few examples:

For example, Sir Arthur Knight is vulnerable to insults involving modern culture and technology ("[Your mother] <strong>[still uses Windows Vista]</strong> [and] [you] <strong>[never watched Star Wars]</strong>!"), while Nigel Hogg is vulnerable to insults about weight and appearance ("[Your sister] <strong>[looks like]</strong> [a grunting sow] [and] <strong>[can't exercise because of]</strong> [your pimply arse], [and everyone knows it]!")
<ul><li> This also applies to characters in the sequel <em>Oh... Sir!! The Hollywood Roast</em>.

</li><li> The monsters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Evolve">Evolve</a></em> each have a weak point that takes double damage from precision weapons.

</li><li> In the early games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HiryuNoKen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HiryuNoKen">Hiry&#363; no Ken</a></em> series (<em>Flying Dragon</em>, <em>Flying Warriors</em>, etc.), this makes up the bulk of the one-on-one fight scenes. Flashing red marks will appear on your fighter and your opponent. You have to inflict damage by attacking the red marks, while defending when the marks appear on your fighter's body. Occasionally, blue marks will appear when their is an opportunity for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>, and star marks indicate an opportunity for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a>. When <em>no</em> hit markers appear, it's usually a sign that your opponent is about to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">super-strong attack</a>.
</li><li> Almost every enemy in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebGame">flash game series</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stormwinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stormwinds">Stormwinds</a></em> has a weak spot. If you see anything on the enemy vehicles that resembles parachutes, flotation devices (balloons) or exposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> machinery, attacking them in those spots will make them <em>hurt</em>, often causing extra damage. Usually, around halfway through the first level of each game, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook">Heavily Armored</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> hanging from a <em>very obvious</em> bunch of balloons is introduced, quickly teaching the player that they need to strike said balloons to end it effectively.

</li><li> Every boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered">Sundered</a></em> has three Elder Shard fragments sticking out of its body, and attacking these fragments is the only way to harm them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDivision">The Division</a></em>, certain enemy types have specific "weak points" that can be shot at in order to deal massive damage to that enemy. Grenadiers, for example, have grenade satchels; shoot them enough, and they'll explode. This instantly kills the grenadier and can deal significant damage to other nearby enemies or cause secondary effects (e.g. Cleaner grenadiers go up in an incendiary blast that sets fire to other nearby enemies).
</li><li> This is pretty much how you defeat your enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HorizonZeroDawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em>. Your various arrows and tools will mostly just plink off the massive machines populating the world, but shooting the assorted weak points in their chassis will do much more damage. Depending on what you hit, you can also rupture an especially volatile component on the machine which could set it on fire, freeze it, overload it with electricity, or trigger an explosion. This trope applies to human enemies to a lesser degree; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">arrows by and large don't do much damage</a> unless they hit them in the head.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AkaneTheKunoichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AkaneTheKunoichi">Akane the Kunoichi</a></em>, some of the bosses have to be hit in the face. One of them shields his face when not attacking, so you have to time it right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouchTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouchTheDead">Touch The Dead</a></em>, each boss has a weak point you need to shoot at in order to deal damage.
</li><li> Two of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em> required you to attack their weakpoints in order to defeat them. The Tower Knight forced you to run around his titanic greatshield to hit his heels until stumbled and fell over, exposing his vulnerable head to your attacks, while the Adjudicator's blubbery body was almost impervious to your attacks except for a gaping wound in its belly with a snapped blade protruding from it (apparently one of its own cleavers), which when struck would cause the boss to slump forward, letting you reach the golden bird sitting on its head that controlled it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> trilogy also featured a number of bosses utilizing these mechanics:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a>,</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">much-reviled</a> Bed of Chaos was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> which could only be defeated by striking the two orbs on either side of it, then making your way through its body to reach its heart... where you found a single Chaos Bug that would perish in one blow. Several other bosses in the game have vulnerable points where hitting them can cut off their body parts (such as the tails of dragons or the Bell Gargoyles) but attacking these are optional, although doing so will not only give you a special weapon but prevent them from using their tail lash attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> features the Demon of Song, whose froglike body is completely invulnerable to your attacks until it opens up the skin covering its front to reveal its skull-like face and long arms, with which it attempts to grab and eat you. The Duke's Dear Freja can only be damaged by attacking either of the two heads at either end of its gigantic spider body. Finally, while you can hit Sinh the Slumbering Dragon anywhere to damage it, hitting it anywhere other than its head causes its corrosive poison to degrade your weapon extremely quickly, while striking its head also does more damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> the Curse-Rotted Greatwood can only be effectively damaged by attacking the pallid white pustules sprouting from various points of its bulbous body, or the long white arm it sprouts in the later stage of the battle. High Lord Wolnir is also almost completely immune your attacks, but by attacking and shattering the magical bracelets he wears on his arms you can send him careening into the depths of the Abyss. You <em>can</em> theoretically defeat him with pure damage, but it's not recommended. Finally, as with Sinh from the previous game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Darkeater Midir</a> takes additional damage when struck on the head rather than going for the more accessible limbs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BonanzaBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BonanzaBros">Bonanza Bros.</a></em>: The riot shield guards can only be shot in the back and side, or slammed with doors.
</li><li> Every Octarian boss in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> series has the <em>same</em> weak point (save for DJ Octavio) - a giant tentacle. Very few of the bosses will leave this tentacle exposed on their own, so you&#146;ll have to reveal it first, whether by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">waiting for an attack that leaves it vulnerable</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedItABomb">Feeding It a Bomb</a>, or destroying a series of smaller weak points. It&#146;s explained via one Sunken Scroll in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> that these tentacles are cut from a host Octarian (implied to be Octavio himself) and are what give the mechanical bosses some degree of sentience.
</li><li> Most enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BulletGirlsPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BulletGirlsPhantasia">Bullet Girls Phantasia</a></em> have an exposed blue crystal core that, when shot, can instantly kill them or cause massive damage.

When Cordovin spots what Ruby is trying to do, she protects the missile launcher by closing it back inside the arm cannon. Ruby unexpectedly decides to charge inside the cannon itself, and Jaune immediately figures out what she's doing: because of what Oscar said, the missiles and Dust will be stored together inside the arm cannon, making them extremely vulnerable to a well-placed shot &mdash; but only if the shot is taken from inside the cannon itself. This time, the plan works and the arm cannon is rendered inoperable; the extra weight caused by the damage it sustains makes it impossible for Cordovin to move the robot without first severing the entire arm.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder19" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Standard operating procedure for the US military, since doctrine is based on the concept of denying the enemy the ability to fight effectively. Enemy has fighters? Bomb their runways so they can't take off or land. Enemy has tanks? Tanks cannot move without fuel, and fuel trucks aren't armored, so bomb the fuel trucks <em>and</em> the roads they travel on. This turns the tanks into armored, stationary pillboxes. Keep on bombing the supply lines so that the tank crews don't have food or water, forcing them to abandon the tanks and walk home. If you're feeling particularly vindictive, bomb them while they're marching home so they can't live to fight another day.
</li><li> Tanks are almost always vulnerable from above and below, and to a lesser extent, the sides and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.simhq.com/_air/air_053j.html">rear<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Tank Destroyers and other specialized AFVs often take this further, in some cases resulting in open-topped or open-backed vehicles such as the M10 and Marder series.
<ul><li> Specific tanks can also have specific weak points. Early models of the Sherman tank were vulnerable to deadly fires and explosions if enemy fire reached their turret-stored ammunition. The first attempted fix was welding an extra armor plate over the vulnerable section. Unfortunately, this served as a video-game-style "shoot here for maximum damage" bullseye to German gunners, and ammunition explosions became <strong>more</strong> common with the retrofitted tanks. Later models moved most of the Sherman's ammunition down into the hull (and gave it further protection from fire), solving the problem properly.
</li><li> It's usually difficult, if not impossible, for an infantry team to attack a tank from above. If the enemy has a good formation, attacking it from behind is difficult too. To solve this problem, the Javelin Missile Launcher was created. This is a missile that can either fire in a straight line, like most missiles, or, in an awesome display of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching">Roboteching</a>, travel about three feet forward and then <em>straight up</em> to a height between 500 and 1000 feet, before inverting and smashing down on the tank from above. The only defense against a Javelin Missile attack is to <em>kill the user before he can fire it</em>. Or go underground (but then, the missile <em>still</em> fires straight if need be...).
</li><li> A common tactic against tanks from the very beginning is to try to blow one of the tracks off or otherwise jam the drive. This was especially effective against tanks in urban warfare or dense jungles and forests, where infantry could sneak up or wait for a tank to drive past, then rush out and toss grenades and satchel charges at the tracks, or prepare a hidden bomb in the road. An immobile tank is pretty much useless, and even worse when it blocks a road and holds up everybody behind it.
</li><li> The Molotov Cocktail was devised as an anti-tank weapon by Guomindang troops fighting the Japanese the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>... or possibly by Spanish Republicans and Nationalists fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a>, though the name was given to it by Finns fighting the Soviets in the 'Winter War' of 1940-41.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5muhh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5muhh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5muhh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Soviet Foreign Minister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">Vyacheslav Molotov</a> claimed that Soviet planes weren't dropping bombs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">they were dropping food supplies</a>. The Finns developed a drink to go with the food.</span> Tanks of the time could be disabled by pouring a flammable liquid over the (outside of) engine and setting it alight, so it was only a matter of time before someone got the bright idea of filling a bottle with petrol or spirits and putting a burning rag in the mouth. Even if the fire didn't spread into the tank itself and set its ammunition off, the fumes and smoke were would force the crew to choose between suffocating and bailing out.
</li><li> During the battle of Stalingrad, Yakov Pavlov commanded a platoon that took over a apartment building (now known as Pavlov's House). They found that by placing Soviet anti-tank rifles on the roof they could actually shoot nearly straight down onto a tanks turret (with them being so high up the tank couldn't shoot back). Pavlov is said to have taken out over a dozen tanks himself this way. The fighting for the southern Grain Silo was also characterised by the defenders' ability to do this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Military ground vehicle designers are getting smarter about protection</a>, what with the introduction of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-hull">the V-shaped hull<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to certain armored vehicles<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6g6o5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6g6o5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6g6o5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(basically, it's just taking a boxy iron car and giving it angled sides)</span>. V-hulls borrow the deflecting hoo-ha used by sloped armor. In simple English, it's supposed to take most of the damage from the bad guys standing straight ahead <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note725sh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note725sh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note725sh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">because most of the time, that's where you find them holding antitank weapons, anyway</span> or from explosives underneath the vehicle and then point it elsewhere. What you end up with is a vehicle that's not as scratched as compared to a regular vehicle in the same situation.
<ul><li> And in the case of a tank which would rather make the first move than try to resist a pounding, it's an active protection system, which goes <em>way</em> back in the 1970s, apparently pioneered by the Soviet Union. The first APS, codenamed the <em>Drozd</em>, had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">point-defense problem</a>: a good portion of antitank rockets still made their way through the tank and the <em>Drozd</em> only covered the front. Recent developments have fixed this problem, though.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Battleship deck armour in general was significantly thinner than the belt (side) armour, making them vulnerable to attack from above. Hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">ridiculously large number of anti-aircraft guns</a> fitted to the last generation of battleships. Plunging fire at long range could be at least as effective than a broadside at point-blank. Hits below the belt (e.g., torpedoes) could also be fatal.
<ul><li> Modern torpedoes do NOT strike the ships they target. Instead, they deliberately explode underneath the ships. This causes an air bubble and causes the ship to literally break in half under its own weight.
<ul><li> It didn't work in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> when they tried to use magnetic fuses to do this.
</li></ul></li><li> HMS <em>Hood</em> provides an excellent example: her deck armor proved too thin and was pierced by a German shell with catastrophic results. Specifically, it was in a part of the armored deck a few feet from where said deck had been thickened during a refit. <em>Right above the ammunition magazine.</em>
</li><li> British aircraft carriers suffered much less severely from kamikaze attacks in the Pacific than American ones, as the British usually had armored decks, while the American had only wooden decks that could be easily smashed through by a plane.
<ul><li> Generally justified. In the case of most of the more lightly-armed cruisers, destroyers, etc., the trade off was that they were faster than they would be with the full armor protection, allowing them to be able to keep up with the carriers <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8zec1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8zec1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8zec1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> which to this day tend to be the fastest ships in most navies that have them</span>. For the aircraft carriers, armoring the flight deck meant adding considerable structural support which effectively made the hangar deck much smaller. Most commanders would rather be able to carry more planes to destroy their attackers <em>before</em> they could engage the carrier rather than have some extra armor plating to deal with them once they got to them. Of course the example of the Japanese carriers at Midway demonstrates that that does not always work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">In fact</a>, British naval doctrine led to the armoring of their carriers due to the fact that they were designed to serve in the "cramped" waters of the Mediterranean, where no matter how many airplanes you put on them, they would always be outnumbered by the shore-based aircraft available to the enemy. The resultant armoured carriers were, compared to their American contemporaries, about two knots slower and had a smaller complement of aircraft, but in the end were a success, as the six <em>Illustrious</em>-class carriers survived everything the Germans, Italians and later the Japanese threw at them in ca. six years of wartime service. And despite the small complement of aircraft, HMS <em>Illustrious</em> managed to single-handedly disable three battleships and damage two cruisers in the 1940 raid on Taranto.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The German battleship <em>Bismarck</em> was incredibly highly armed and armored, and one of the greatest warships ever built at the time. A single lucky torpedo from an obsolete British biplane bomber hit and disabled the rudder,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note94jmd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note94jmd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note94jmd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the standard defense against torpedoes is to start making sharp turns, and the torpedo jammed the rudder, causing <em>Bismark</em> to go round in circles</span> making her essentially a sitting duck. Without any support by other ships, she was attacked the next morning and had to be scuttled without causing any significant damage to the attackers.
<ul><li> Well armed and armoured maybe, but its design of three propeller shafts rather than four was a big flop, not only did it critically weaken the keel, (leading to the 'ability' of a single torpedo to jam the rudders), but it also made steering a pig (not helped by really-too-small rudders). She was a battleship, with emphasis on the 'battle' rather than the 'ship'. She was also more vulnerable to plunging fire than contemporary British designs due to an outdated armor layout, which resulted in one of the shells from the <em>Prince of Wales</em> severing the forward fuel line. The secondary armament wasn't much good either, making it especially vulnerable to low-altitude torpedo bombers. The same issues were faced by the <em>Scharnhorst</em> class, though in neither case were they to prove critical, since <em>Gneisenau</em> was wrecked in her docks, while <em>Scharnhorst</em> fell to naval gunnery and torpedoes.
</li><li> Weak stern was the common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> of all German warships. The last torpedo of HMS Dorsetshire <em>effectively tore off</em> the stern of Bismarck. Had the scuttling failed, the torpedo damage from HMS Dorsetshire certainly would have given Bismarck the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoupDeGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoupDeGrace">Coup de Gr&acirc;ce</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most warships during the first half of the 20th century featured a citadel which contained nearly all the ship's vital equipment. At first this may seem like a subversion because the citadel is the most armored area except the magazines on a warship. However piercing this area is more than worth the trouble of the armor as any shell going off within the citadel can seriously damage a ship's fighting capability and guarantees months of repairs. Case and point, the Japanese battleship <em>Kirishima</em> had its citadel breached multiple times by the battleship <em>Washington</em> but suffered comparatively little damage else where. The IJN tried to tow <em>Kirishima</em> to safety until it was revealed that <em>Washington</em>'s 16-inch shells had destroyed <em>all</em> of the ship's citadel equipment, including the pumps and fire suppression system. This left the crew with nothing to combat the minor flooding or fires she was suffering from and she had to be abandoned.
</li><li> Pretty much every warship since the introduction of gunpowder has had one spectacular weak spot: the magazine, where the powder and ammunition is stored. Usually located deep within the ship for maximum protection, if anything <em>does</em> penetrate to the magazine, there is a very solid chance that it will take the whole ship with it, as happened to HMS <em>Hood</em> in the Battle of the Denmark Strait and USS <em>Arizona</em> at Pearl Harbor. Other vulnerable spots include propulsion systems (the masts and rigging on a sailing ship, or the boilers and screws/paddles on a steamship). In addition to being unable to maneuver, a ship that takes a hit to the engines will also likely be unable to produce power to work the guns or water pumps, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">making it impossible to fight fires or stop flooding during battle.</a>
</li><li> Japanese cruisers during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> had REALLY BAD weak points. While they had decent armor, and were in fact superior to early-war American cruisers, their torpedoes proved to be their undoing. To elaborate, unlike most other countries' torpedoes, which used compressed air or chemical propellant, the Japanese torpedoes used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">oxygen</a>, which roughly translates to 'highly volatile if hit by a shell or bomb'. One of the most notable examples of this happening was during the Battle off Samar, where three of these very cruisers were more or less destroyed/sunk when American 5-inch guns and torpedoes/bombs managed to score lucky hits on the torpedo tubes. Even more impressive, the escort carrier <em>White Plains</em> used her single 5-inch gun to disable the heavy cruiser <em>Chokai</em> with a lucky strike on her torpedo rack. This is the only time a carrier has ever destroyed a warship with surface fire.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Battle of Midway</a>, the Imperial Japanese aircraft carrier <em>Akagi</em>, flagship of Admiral Nagumo, was struck by a single 1000 lb bomb from an American dive bomber. The bomb, however hit the ship's the middle aircraft elevator and detonated inside its hanger, where the <em>Akagi's</em> own bomber planes were being fueled and armed. This resulted in setting off the munitions inside the hanger and, even worse, the aviation fuel supplies. This started an uncontrollable fire that forced it to be abandoned and scuttled later that day.
</li><li> Modern warships are less armoured due the main danger to them switching from guns to missiles, aircraft, and submarine-launched torpedoes, and a tactical doctrine of intercepting the enemy vessel (or projectile) <em>before</em> it hits the ship. However, that has given them another weak point: disable a warship's sensors (mainly radar), and hopefully its radio communications, and a modern warship is as good as sunk when it comes to being a threat.
<ul><li> In fact, that weak point is one of the big reasons ships don't have armor these days. Radars and other electronic sensors cannot be effectively armored, and if a hit is going to disable them with or without armor, then better to dispense with weight and volume-intensive armor for better speed and more active defenses.
</li></ul></li><li> Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik was extremely well protected and armoured, and difficult to shoot down. It had only two weak points: the engine radiator (it had water cooled engine) and the main wing spar (breaking it would render the wings and fuselage on so hard stress the plane would disintegrate in mid-flight). The German and Finnish pilots were instructed to approach the Shturmovik from an inclined sector from behind and aim at the joint of the wing and fuselage, effectively cutting the main wing spar. Conversely, if a photograph shows a shot-down Shturmovik relatively intact, it has either had its pilot killed or engine shot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a> in a sparring match.
<ul><li> There are many spots on the human body that remain vulnerable to simple attacks of people's hands and feet, no matter what sort of training you do &mdash; like, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">your eyes</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore">But Wait, There's More!</a>! The throat, the nose; really, the head in general...
<ul><li> Groin, ears, eyes, nose, throat, and the knees are all targets where a weaker opponent can do <em>significant</em> damage to a stronger person. For women's self defense classes, scratching a man's eyes out with your fingernails or anything else you can get your hands on is one of the first moves taught. Experienced fighters know that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneeCapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneeCapping">hard, fast kick to the inside of someone's knee</a> (the knee is designed to bend in only <em>one</em> direction, and bending it in any other direction is crippling) will take someone out of a fight no matter how much muscle or experience they have. This is the reason why, in organized fighting, all of these are areas where attacking them will result in instant disqualification.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of these are justified by the function of the body part in question. Testicles must be on the outside to enable them to be cooler than the rest of the body; if they were kept inside, the body heat would reduce fertility. Eyes can't be shielded very much or they can't see as well. And so on.
</li><li> As pointed out by William E. Fairbairn (who, as a policeman in 1930s Shanghai, one of the deadliest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hives</a> of the world, had plenty of experience of both giving and receiving blows), weak points of the body defy the very concept of fighting with martial art techniques: attacking the eyes, nose, larynx, plexus or groin can quickly end the fight, with the opponent into the hospital or the grave. Some people that employ systems of fighting, from a boxer to the least educated brawler, use moves which are painful, but not very efficient, like strikes to the forehead (it takes the force of a trained boxer to break one easily), ribcage, upper arm, thigh or tibia. Modern military-based martial arts, such as the Israeli <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KravMaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KravMaga">Krav Maga</a> or the US Marine Corps' MCMAP, focus almost entirely on ending the fight as quickly as possible, as so focus on weak points and using whatever you have to fight with (rifle, knife, shovel).
</li><li> Traditional and modern martial arts alike have movesets that are designed to kill or maim the opponents like this. Aside of attacking the weak points as mentioned above, there is also technique to strike or manipulate the joints and striking the soft organ parts such as kidney or solar plexus. For a more modern example, strikes in arts such as boxing are generally aimed at their own weak points, typically consisting of the solar plexus again, liver, and jaw, though the last of which is struck not with an intent to break it but rather to make the brain slam against the side of the skull due to a quick acceleration and deceleration, causing a knockout.
</li></ul></li><li> Most cats HATE tummy rubs because their instinct is to protect their vulnerable tummies. <strike>A cat rolling over and showing you its stomach is a sign of trust.</strike> Sometimes, if feeling threatened, the cat will roll over on its back to better wield its claws in a stance that basically says "don't come any closer". If the threat does come closer, the cat can then strike with its fangs and four sets of claws at the same time. On the other hand, when they are feeling safe and surrounded by trustable loved ones, they will sometimes instinctively roll over and expose their bellies as a display of this trust and love, as if to say, "I totally don't think you're going to try and kill me, bro." Want to show your cat some serious cat-language affection? When they do this, pet their heads; for cats, that's the friendliest way to acknowledge the relationship, whereas actually petting their bellies is like saying, "oh, you acknowledge me as your superior in the social structure, huh? Yeah, you better!"
<ul><li> The same goes for dogs, in that if a dog shows you its belly, it trusts you. On the other hand, if the dog rolled over first (or if the dog is lying on you in a way that it's impossible to tell whether or not it has in fact rolled over), dogs are generally very happy with such rubs. Oh, dogs...
</li></ul></li><li> Predatory animals typically attack the throat or belly of their prey, as the front of the neck contains vital airways and blood vessels, while the belly is less well-protected by bone than other parts of the torso.
</li><li> When attacked by a shark, most survival experts recommend hitting the shark in its gills and <em>not</em> their eyes or nose. Most sharks have nictitating membranes to protect their eyes and their noses are surprisingly sturdy. However, unlike most fish, a shark's gills lack the protective covers are surprisingly susceptible to pain. In the wild, many dolphins and sea turtles were able to defend themselves by hitting and biting a shark's gills.
</li><li> Safes, of all things, have weakpoints where their defense is intentionally lower. Naturally, their location is a guarded secret and not advertised.
<ul><li> Although a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">safe</a> bet is to turn the safe on its side and try and crack the bottom.
</li></ul></li><li> By the early Renaissance, plate armor had become so good at protecting the wearer that they were nearly immune to anything up to and including musket fire. The standard way to kill someone was to beat them with something heavy until they were knocked to the ground (the poleaxe or warhammer were popular choices for this), then stab a thin, pointy dagger into the joints, or through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">slots in their visor</a>.
<ul><li> This is where the phrase "chink in the armor" comes from &mdash; the joints were notable weak spots for the dagger.
</li><li> This is also where the term "bulletproof" comes from. The standard test for armor quality was to fire a musket at the breastplate. The resulting dent would be proof that it could resist a bullet.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOe5Lmyyxiw">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of ants attacking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab">crab</a> for food. The ants managed to do this by probing the crab for weak points in its armour then attacking them.
<ul><li> Also by chewing its eyes out and also PRYING ITS GODDAMN MOUTH OPEN and sending ants inside.
</li></ul></li><li> The field of social engineering came about as a method of attacking the weak point inherent in every digital security system: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons">the people who use it.</a> There's no better method of getting a password than convincing somebody that they should give it up.
</li><li> Wooden sailing vessels were vulnerable at the bow and stern both because the guns were pointing elsewhere and the attackers shot could go all the way down the deck causing more mayhem per round. Hence the tactic of "crossing the T", where the attacker attempts to broadside an opponent down their length.
</li><li> Armies are vulnerable in the flank and rear, because the enemy is expecting them from a different direction, because the attackers can concentrate on a weaker force, and because supply lines are vulnerable. Also the borders between unit jurisdictions are a vulnerable spot.
</li><li> The first thing any hunter of game will learn how to do is to fire their weapon at the most vulnerable areas of the animal's body, typically somewhere in the center mass or the head for either a heart or brain shot. Dropping the animal immediately not only reduces the chance of the animal fleeing or charging, but also humanely ends the animal's life with no or the absolute minimum of suffering.
</li><li> A tarantula hawk wasp targets a tarantula's belly because it is less armored than the rest of it. It will flip the spider on its back or attack when it rears up to attack.
</li><li> This is the main point of fame of the Prince Rupert's Drop&mdash;essentially, what happens when you spool a drip of molten glass into cold water and it solidifies. Due to the circumstances of their formation, the resulting drops are incredibly durable, especially for something made of glass, but they have a long "tail" of thin glass filament left over, and if you so much as snap the tail in half with your fingers, the entire drop shatters.
