Specifically, it has to do with a notion in the Japanese culture of narrowing possibilities; if the subject can't be forgiven for a transgression, then the only <em>other</em> possibility is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">he's about to get his head ripped off or be otherwise punished in an equally severe fashion</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1e18n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1e18n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1e18n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The act, being a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>, might cause the person committing it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">become the same person as the victim in terms of morality</a>.</span> In Japanese culture, being able to both ask for forgiveness and accept it are considered virtues; therefore, refusing to accept or offer forgiveness holds a lot more weight. The person who can't forgive <em>won't</em> give this up. This has to do with Japan's brutal code of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">honor</a> dating back to the feudal era. Back in the era of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">samurai</a>, this had even more teeth, since the person who made this challenge very likely <em>would</em> chase you to the ends of the earth for revenge, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">even if doing so was severely detrimental to them</a>. It's only said to someone who (in the speaker's opinion) has crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> because it entails a burden: the speaker is <em>so</em> offended that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> is the <em>only</em> option. Obviously, it can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAsskickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAsskickingOneLiner">Pre-Asskicking One-Liner</a>, so expect serious butt-kicking in the following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight">Right Makes Might</a> fight.

</p><p>It is also used as a way of pointing out to the audience how evil a character is &#151; that they are completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondRedemption">Beyond Redemption</a>. Usually the character being issued the challenge has crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, or is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a>, so the main character can freely kill them now. Though on occasion the audience still wonders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">if it was really unforgivable</a>.
</p><p>Similarly, it can be used to point out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">how</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">stupid</a></em> a character is, their transgression being proof that they are just plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Typically, anyone confronted with this trope will feel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">guilt and remorse</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Or not.</a>
</p><p>Much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingSomeoneThePointerFinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingSomeoneThePointerFinger">Giving Someone the Pointer Finger</a>, this is becoming something of a devalued expression through overuse. It's prone to being bandied about for comedy, and sometimes the hero will change phasers from "kill" to "hug" mid-fight so they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">beat and befriend</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a> villain anyway. This tends to break the emotional impact of "This Is Unforgivable" in series that do so.
</p><p>Villains are also quite fond of using this trope whenever everything is going wrong thanks to those puny heroes, thrown out between "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe">This Cannot Be!</a>" and "I will have my revenge!". "This Is Unforgivable" can also be a sign of either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoatsAreOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoatsAreOff">The Coats Are Off</a> for when the unforgivable escalates a fight's intensity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureInsane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureInsane">You're Insane!</a> when a character is shocked and enraged at the same time by another character's craziness to the point of calling them insane, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenessRequiresDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenessRequiresDeath">Forgiveness Requires Death</a> which offers the chance at forgiveness... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">via death</a>. Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondRedemption">Beyond Redemption</a>, where a good guy has tried to redeem the bad guy, but gives up after an unforgivable act.

Jonathan responds with the trope name, though he doesn't do anything to follow up on it, at least not for a while; it might have been less of a big deal in this context, seeing as he's not Japanese. Regardless, this little scene paints their relationship for the rest of their lives. It went over so well that it eventually became his default taunt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> <em>[enraged]</em> What was that for?! HOW DARE YOU!
</div><ul><li> Later, after a long string of torment from Dio, what really set Jonathan off was Dio stealing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredFirstKiss">Sacred First Kiss</a> of Erina, Jonathan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>. This prompts an enraged Jonathan to race home to give Dio a thrashing for this injustice.
</li><li> It is rather ironic that Jonathan is so quick to declare this at first; later on he's easily the most forgiving Joestar in the series, by a very wide margin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He even forgives Dio for killing him on his honeymoon, along with <em>everything else</em> he did, and tells him he thinks of him as a friend as they sink to the bottom of the ocean.</span>
</li><li> In Part 2: Jonathan's grandson, Joseph Joestar lays into a mafia gangster and his mook for one: mocking his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenBlackFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenBlackFriend">Token Black Friend</a> Smokey in public, and two: thoughtlessly upsetting Joseph's Granny Erina with news of the supposed death of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle">Honorary Uncle</a> Speedwagon. He would later gundown a vampiric Straizo for the murder.
<ul><li> Despite having never met him, Joseph has clear respect for his deceased grandfather, which makes his hatred for Dio all the more apparent.

After finally being cornered, Dan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsWantMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsWantMercy">begs for mercy</a>, but Jotaro tells it straight to his face that he'll never forgive him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeMeleeRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeMeleeRevenge">savagely beats Dan</a> with Star Platinum.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the climactic battle of Part 3, Jotaro has Dio at his mercy after unlocking the ability to stop time. Unlike his ancestor Jonathan, Jotaro doesn't forgive Dio for all that he's done (which includes killing Kakyoin and Joseph, the latter of whom later gets better), but he won't kill him while he's down, because it would leave a bad taste in his mouth. It's only after Dio shortly recovers from his legs being broken and tries one last desperate attack that Jotaro finally finishes him off.</span>

But then, as young Josuke's life hung in the balance, a young man with a pompadour appeared and offered to help push Tomoko's car through the snow, and mysteriously vanished after he succeeded. Josuke was forever grateful to this teenager, and styled his hair after him in respect.</span> Any insult to his hair <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is seen as an insult to the young man who saved his life</span>, and he will react with violence, as seen when he maims a rude upperclassman with his Stand Crazy Diamond, and he beats Rohan to within an inch of his life after he insults it in their rather one sided fight.

</li><li> The Joestars are well known for not just their determination and ability to withstand pain, but also their compassion and unwillingness to forgive evil. Giorno Giovanna, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the son of DIO conceived through Jonathan Joestar's body</span>, exemplifies this in his own way. His goal is to take control of the Italian mafia gang, Passione, and reform it to be a force for good, to protect innocent people, and he won't spare anyone who harms the innocent. One example of this is when he kills Polpo by making him unwittingly eat his own gun, using Gold Experience to turn it into a banana, which ended with Polpo involuntarily shutting himself in the mouth. Prior to this, Polpo's Stand, Black Sabbath killed an old janitor, and Polpo showed no remorse or care for anyone who got killed because of his Stand's action, due to his belief that God is willing to forgive murder when someone insults you. Giorno takes this to heart when he commits the murder of Polpo.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Giorno:</strong> When someone insults you, even murder is forgivable? I see. What you told me was very important. You insulted that innocent old man's life. So I changed one of your guns into a banana. (Turns with a disgusted frown) You should savor your last meal as best you can.

<ul><li> Then there's that moment in the episode "Sweet and Sour Puss" when a monster called Togeira possesses him, taking away his ability to get angry and causing him to act kind and calm towards others even through all the beatings everyone gives him. Much later, after the King has been pounded and smacked around enough, Togeira, having been storing his anger from within him while everyone was beating on him, stores enough of his anger to unleash it all in one big mega-attack that has Dedede exploding into a massively firey rage that scares everyone and scream at the top of his lungs, "Now it's payback time!" Dedede eventually goes back to his normal self after he slips on a banana peel, therefore knocking Togeira right out of his own head.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Luffy angrily battles Zoro because he had slaughtered most of the villagers of an island (early on into the Baroque Works arc), who had given the Straw Hats plenty of food earlier on (pointed out by Luffy looking like an impossibly fat slob at the moment). Luffy was unaware that they were in fact bounty hunters. He even actually utters "Unforgivable" before the battle rages higher.
</li><li> In fact, any time Luffy angrily shouts something about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> (at a villain, that is), it means this (as abusing one's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> or threatening his own is the one thing that will make Luffy go mad). After this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">asskicking ensues</a>.
</li><li> Robin gets like this whenever someone destroys history in front of her (ruins, artifacts, etc.). In the Skypiea arc, the poor bastard who pressed her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> ended up begging for forgiveness. Robin's response? "No." *CRACK*
</li><li> In the sixth movie, after Luffy sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his entire crew get eaten by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant">Man-Eating Plant</a> partnered to</span> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he invokes this several times&#133;only to be powerless against said Big Bad. It gets an echo later: after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant">Man-Eating Plant</a> is killed, and along with it the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople">Plant People</a> that were created from the Big Bad's memories of his deceased friends and crewmates that he used in order to pretend that they were still alive.</span> Realizing that the illusions were broken, the Big Bad turns on the one who killed his plant while invoking this trope, only to be stopped by Luffy, who <em>kills him</em>. Yes, you read that right; it really was beyond any possibility of forgiveness.
</li><li> Dueling examples from Iceberg and Franky. Iceberg declares he can't forgive Franky for building the weapons that were used to frame their father figure, Tom. Franky in turn cannot forgive Iceberg for building ships for the World Government, who did the framing. Both are subversions. Iceberg states that even if he can't forgive Franky, he is still happy Frankey isn't dead and eventually gets over his anger. Franky later realizes that Iceberg making connections with the government prevented them from doing the same to him as they did with Tom.
</li><li> After learning Doflamingo's extent of crimes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> such as enslaving the native dwarves, turning dissenters to toys, and launching a successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a> against King Riku which not only defamed him, but also doomed his grandchild Rebecca into a hated teenager, pragmatic characters like Franky and <em>Robin</em>, who would normally give the mission the most priority, declare this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>, working then to destroy Doflamingo's regime.</span>
</li><li> Two actions that Sanji will never forgive, let alone do, is waste food or let someone go hungry; he almost starved to death once as a child, and knows it is <em>not</em> pleasant. One of the few times he tried punching a foe (he almost never uses his hands in a fight) was against someone who used food as weapons and armor, clearly never intending to eat it.
<ul><li> Being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a> he is, he will also never forgive anyone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">raises their hand against an innocent woman</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So when his asshole brother Niji does everything mentioned above, you can simply imagine Sanji's utter <em><strong>FURY</strong></em>.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> A favourite line of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em>'s Masaru Daimon.
<ul><li> Typically, dubs don't carry this phrase over, substituting it for something that sounds more badass to the Western ear, but the Savers dub, <em>Digimon Data Squad</em>, actually uses this phrase frequently. And since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kurata</span> is the biggest monster in the Digi-verse (yes, even Myotismon has met his match) everyone gets a chance to say it more than a few times. The dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a>,</em> on the other hand, used it once, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Takato</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Guilmon</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Gallantmon</a>. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker">Beelzemon</a>, who said "You can't <em>forgive</em> me? I don't recall ever <em>asking</em> for forgiveness!" And then the fight was on. It's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmful</a> like the Data Squad version because Gallantmon didn't dramatically yell it, but stated it in a more matter-of-fact "this is why I must kill you" manner, befitting a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>.
<ul><li> Despite <em>Digimon</em> being a kids show, Gallantmon was willing to execute Beelzemon, and would have gone through with it were it not for the fact that said enemy's biggest victim, Juri/Jeri, asked for him to be spared.
</li><li> Also (bonus points for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>) not only Takato and Guilmon, but the rest of the heroes <em>including</em> Jeri <em>do</em> forgive him after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>. Beelzemon, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAllMySinsRemembered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAllMySinsRemembered">never quite manages to forgive himself</a>, and says this trope word-for-word.
<div class="indent"><strong>Beelzemon:</strong> What I did... is beyond forgiveness. I don't need anyone to tell me that.

Loweemon gets in the way and sacrifices himself against said attack, and Lucemon absorbs Koichi's data after the deliverance of both darkness spirits to Koji by him following that. Takuya does not take well to what Lucemon did to Koichi AT ALL. "How could you?! Lucemon, you've gone too far!!!!" Cue the appearance of Susanoomon afterwards</span>.
<ul><li> Prior to that, the DigiDestined were in their final battle against Crusadermon and Dynasmon. Interestingly, up until that point, every other time they fought them, the Royal Knights had been kicking their sorry asses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Lucemon was finally resurrected</span>.

Enraged, Dynasmon vows to make the children pay for the "ruinous wound" as he called it, and prepares to use his Breath of Wyvern attack... only to proceed to get his butt handed to him on a plate by EmperorGreymon just as easily.

Willie continually stalls for time, hoping that by holding out and by merely admitting the truth later, he would be absolved of his actions and &mdash; get this &mdash; be allowed to go to a party where he would get to consummate a relationship with the most desirable girl in class.

Instead, Valerie blows her stack, and not only does she refuse to accept the apology (since she sees less than zero sincerity in his attempt to blow things off as "no big deal") but tells him he's grounded from going to that much-anticipated party. Even worse: Valerie declares to Willie that, at least temporarily, she has lost trust in him. (And we don't even get to see how Michael will take the news (series star Josh Turner was not in this episode, his character said to be returning home from a flight) ... although we do see Valerie leave the house to pick Michael, an airline pilot, from the airport and she leaves it to Willie to sweat things out.)

</li><li> In the other case, it's perfectly fine to take this option, as the character is legitimately a self-serving sleazeball who caused the death of the lead character's best friend out of nothing more than petty greed &mdash; the conversation option for killing him actually <em>reads</em> "You're the one person I can't forgive."
</li><li> After Gremio, your protagonist's servant and protector, fools checkpoint guards into thinking that said protagonist is not the now-rebellious son of Teo McDohl, but his own son, and begins to shout at him for never doing anything right, even now being mistaken for a criminal. He is then stopped by pleading guards from killing his 'son' right in front of them. After safe passage, Gremio apologizes to the protagonist for his improvised actings, to which you can actually respond to with <em>"Unforgivable!"</em> This can go on for a short while, and messing with him is all fun and laughs until it nearly results in him killing himself out of shame.

<div class="indent"><strong>Alucard:</strong> Demon. Death is too good for you.
</div><ul><li> He <em>does</em> say "Yurusan" in the Japanese, and is so VERY damn stone-cold about both that and the worse-than-death fate that his killing her in the dream-world will bring about (it's a death of the soul, so her spirit will never find rest and will wander lost for eternity). This followed by the only fade-to-black death in the game, and (in the original Japanese; the dub is uh...different) a very creepy cut-off scream from her.

There's a deep, personal reason for this.
<ul><li> Used for humor in the first case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a></em>. A body is found in Edgeworth's office, what gets him really mad? Someone broke his prized tea set!

It cost more than your whole month's paycheck. <br><strong>Gumshoe:</strong> W...Whaaaaaaaat!? Now I feel like the killer's wasted one of my monthly paychecks!
</div></li><li> Shelly de Killer. After finding out that his client taped the crime scene for blackmail, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaks his contract with Engarde, returns Maya to Phoenix and swears that Engarde will get his just desserts.</span> The moral of the story: Don't piss off an assassin.
<div class="indent"><strong>Edgeworth:</strong> Some time in the near future, one very betrayed assassin may appear before you. Needless to say, that man is very good at what he does. I'm sure you know what I mean, if you watch this video.
</div></li><li> Phoenix also views Franziska's suppressing a photograph during Maya's trial this way. It turns out there's more to this tactic than he thinks, but she is still trying to get Maya convicted by any means necessary.
<div class="indent"><strong>Phoenix:</strong> (Unforgivable, Von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!)
</div></li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly often used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>. For example, Renault versus Nergal in FE7: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You villain... You cursed him! Your crime can never be forgiven! I will end you with my hands. In the name of my lost friend</span>!" Or Jill versus Ashnard in <em>FE9</em>: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">...Ashnard... Ashnard!! ASHNARD!! I...will never forgive you! NEVER!!!</span>" Or Elincia versus Ashnard: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yet my purpose here is to defeat you. In the name of my father, my mother, my lord uncle, and the countless citizens of Crimea... You murdered them all! And I will never forgive you that!</span>" Yep, FE loves this declaration.

This failed, so Sonia tries to have her killed. THAT fails, and Nino eventually joins the heroes. During their confrontation, Sonia gleefully admits to slaughtering Nino's parents. Nino doesn't take it well. "Aaahhh!!! You're no perfect being! You're a monster in human form! No mercy! No forgiveness!!!"</span>
</li><li> Lyn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">FE7</a></em> has two of these. The first is against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">her granduncle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Lord Lundgren</a>, for trying to assasinate her, poisoning her grandfather (his own brother), and harming the people under his charge to whom he has a duty. The second is an actual utterance, when she, Eliwood and Hector discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the murder of Leila, an Ostian spy and Matthew's lover</span>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lyn:</strong> Unforgivable! This is... a foul deed. Beyond foul.
</div></li><li> In his own story path, Hector shares in the above (for Lyn's second This Is Unforgivable) by swearing a vendetta against the Black Fang until he finds the one responsible. He also echoes Lyn's "I have neither pity nor mercy for you" when he confronts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Nergal</a>. Notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Eliwood</a> does <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">not</a></em> possess this quality despite Nergal killing his father.
</li></ul></li><li> When X declares to Gate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a> 6</em>, "Time to teach you a lesson, Gate! You used Zero's DNA to cause the Reploids pain. All for your own ego! I won't forgive you!"
<ul><li> Also, for a villain example in said franchise:
<div class="indent"><strong>X:</strong> So you're the Big Cheese? <br><strong>Ride Boarski:</strong> Big Cheese?! Arggghhhhmm! How dare you call me that! I'm the Head Honcho, for crying out loud! <br><strong>X:</strong> OK, whatever you say. I order you to disband this motorcycle gang! <br><strong>Ride Boarski:</strong> Motorcycle gang?! Why you!! You've gone too far! I'll make you pay for this, with a duel!
</div></li><li> <em>Maverick Hunter X</em>, the remake of the first game, features this from X towards Sigma before their final battle. "What you've done is unforgivable, Sigma!" At the time, Zero had just died <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5cbdv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5cbdv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5cbdv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(unlike the original, where his death happened two stages ago)</span>, and X is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">furious</a></em>, and it's reflected in the dub delivery, which actually gives the line weight.

When you talk to Preston Garvey after taking over a settlement, though, he'll proclaim that any kind of friendship you two once had is gone.
<div class="indent"><strong>Preston Garvey:</strong> You've crossed the line, General! There are some things I can't forgive!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rosenkreuzstilette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rosenkreuzstilette">RosenkreuzStilette</a></em>:
<ul><li> After laying her undead grandfather Raimund Seyfarth back to rest in her alternate mode, Grolla, both infuriated and deeply hurt, declares this trope in vowing to punish Graf Michael Sepperin for disrupting his peaceful slumber.
<div class="indent"><strong>Grolla:</strong> Michael Zeppelin... your reasons mean nothing to me. There will be no mercy. You shall pay for this with your life.
</div></li><li> In the main game, Spiritia and Lilli say two variations of this trope to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Iris in Iris Stage 3. First, Lilli shouts out "You're gonna pay!" to her, and Tia follows with the common variation of "Iris, I'll never forgive you!"</span>
</li><li> Zorne is quite fond of using this trope, especially as one of her pre-battle quotes or when Grolla confronts her after having defeated her friend Trauare, which is one of quite a few things that can press Zorne's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Zorne:</strong> About time you showed up, Grolla! If it weren't for you, Trau would still be a part of RKS! You're gonna pay for that!

For example, May says this to I-No when she catches her tormenting and hurting her friend Dizzy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> is another game that also likes this trope. For example, Ragna the Bloodedge, the main protagonist, says this when he uses Hell's Fang on his hated rival Jin Kisaragi. The same thing is also done in his winquote against him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ragna:</strong> I'll never forgive you, you son of a bitch. I was gonna tell you to die a slow, painful death, but I don't got the patience to wait around, so you're dying now.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Kokonoe:</strong> I've just got one question to ask you. Why did you betray my mother? <br><strong>Hazama:</strong> "Betray?" Come on, don't give me that. It's not like the Six Heroes were buddies... then the other day, I told the old man, "We're buddies, right?!" Hahahaha! <br><strong>Kokonoe:</strong> You... you bastard! I'll never forgive you! Lambda! Kick the shit out of him!
</div><ul><li> And for the encore there's this exchange between Ragna and Hazama/Yuuki Terumi in <em>Continuum Shift</em>'s True Ending:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ragna:</strong> Terumi... <em>Terumi</em>... I will <em>never forgive you</em>! <br><strong>Hazama:</strong> You won't forgive me? Like I give a damn! Just shut up and die already!
</div></li><li> Since Hazama/Yuuki Terumi is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sustained by hatred, never forgiving him is playing him straight into his hands...
