<p>All games have mechanics &mdash; predefined methods that the players use to interact with the game world. Some of them are well-received, others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">not so much</a>. And then there are mechanics that are cool and innovative... but only come up once or twice in play and are then never used again in the game or even in the entire series. This can happen for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">variety of reasons</a> &mdash; maybe it had to be cut out due to production problems, or the designers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">didn't realize it would be popular</a>, or it was discovered to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> and had to be limited in where it could be used, or just found that it simply did not work in practice and cut most of it out. The end result is that the players want more of it, and don't get any.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> had tons of accessories (many which were from third parties) that either didn't gain enough traction in popularity or simply didn't work well. R.O.B. is a famous example for being a miniature robot that acted like a glorified controller, worked with only two games, and was quietly discontinued by Nintendo. (Its <em>real</em> purpose was to serve as a marketing gimmick to get stores interested in selling another video game console after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a>.) The Power Glove is another big example where the glove acted as a controller based on your arm movement. The Power Glove was only designed for two games and while it could be used with other games via programming the glove, it hardly ever worked and Nintendo never gave it official support due to the glove not being made by them.
</li><li> The Super Scope was a light gun for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> similar to the NES Zapper. Unlike the Zapper, the Super Scope was wireless and required <em>six</em> AA batteries to operate. Very few games were made for the gun and it quickly died out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a>:
<ul><li> The Transfer Pak, whose selling point was letting people transfer data between specific Game Boy games and N64 games, had very few games that took advantage of such a feature, many of which were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a> titles, and many others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never left Japan</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, the Controller Pak was the system's memory card, originally intended to allow players to exchange game data over multiple cartridges. However, it had a paltry 32KB of space and some games could take up the entire thing with their save files. While initially popular with third-party developers to eliminate the need for built-in cartridge-saving as a cost-cutting measure, the need for the Controller Pak died over time once more games started to allow saving within the game cartridge itself. Even Nintendo themselves abandoned the Controller Pak after using it in only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaveRace">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart64">games</a>, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">third game</a> that supports it coming out as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">very last first-party game for the system.</a>
</li><li> The 64DD was an add-on for the Nintendo 64 where the system could read and write disks that held up to 64MB of storage and the console could connect to the internet. The accessory was a commercial failure in Japan with only 9 games made for the thing and was discontinued before it could launch worldwide.
</li></ul></li><li> The e-Reader was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> accessory that allowed players to scan cards to activate new items or levels in compatible games. The e-Reader sold poorly and Nintendo quickly discontinued it, leaving the accessory with very few games it could work with. The discontinued support also meant the GBA port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> had only half of its e-Reader cards available, which made the rest of the e-Reader exclusive content <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> until Nintendo released the game on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> with the e-Reader stages unlocked (though even then, you couldn't use any of the other e-Reader features like powerup cards).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>:
<ul><li> The console had an expansion port that supported LAN play, but very few games actually supported the feature. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></em> is notable since LAN support theoretically made it possible to have up to sixteen players all playing at once (eight racers at once with two characters per kart), but you needed at least two television screens minimum to take advantage of it.
</li><li> The first model of the GameCube had a digital AV port that was used by the component cables, which would allow the console to output up to 480i or, if the game supported it, 480p. The cables were sold exclusively at Nintendo's online store and they were quietly discontinued around two years later with Nintendo citing that there was a lack of demand from consumers (around 1% according to Nintendo) and producing the cables was expensive since the GameCube didn't actually output digital signals and it had to be done through the component cables themselves. This resulted in a second GameCube model released sometime later that removed the digital AV port. This was also during a time when HDTV was relatively new and Nintendo wasn't on board with the HD market. Because the component cables didn't sell a lot, the ones that remain are sold secondhand at very high prices.
</li><li> A microphone accessory was made for the system and bundled with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a> 6</em>. Barely any games were made for the microphone and it simply never got used.
</li><li> The Game Boy Advance to GameCube controller cable would link the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube and allow it to either be used as a controller or to transfer data between games. Not many games used the feature and many consumers passed on it when certain multiplayer games required each player to have a Game Boy Advance and the controller link cable, making it simply too expensive for most people.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>:
<ul><li> PictoChat was fun to use at gaming-related social events such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention">Fan Conventions</a>, but sadly (due to concerns from parents about child predators) the feature was not brought back for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, causing PictoChat to basically go dead once the 3DS started to gain momentum.
</li><li> DS Download Play is a great way to get your friends to play with you even if they don't have their own copies of the game, to give them "lite" or demo versions of the game you're playing, and to try out demo versions of games at stores that have the infrastructure to offer downloads. While you can still do Download Play for DS games on a 3DS, only a select few 3DS games (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7">Mario Kart 7</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS</a></em>) offer this function.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>:
<ul><li> The Wii Remotes actually have a small amount of read-writable data, allowing you to store a few things like Miis and a few games' data. However, likely because the amount of R/W data can be counted in single-digit kilobytes, only a few games actually make use of this feature.
</li><li> The Wii Zapper and Wii Wheel were plastic shells that housed the Wii Remote, allowing the player to pretend they were holding a steering wheel and gun respectively. Only a handful of games were made for those accessories and it was possible to play said games without the accessory at all.
</li><li> The Wii Speak microphone was an accessory that hardly had any compatible games. Its main draw was using it with the Wii Speak Channel, which was a program that allowed friends to come together and talk to each other in voice chat. Almost no one used it all since you couldn't use the chat program while playing a game and voice chat was easier to use on PC. The program became effectively useless once Nintendo shut down their online services for the Wii.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> can actually support up to 7 controllers at once. Good luck finding a game that doesn't cap at 4 players and actually makes use of this.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> <em>does</em> have native audio input support and as such you can plug a headset into the audio jack for voice chat (as opposed to using the Switch smartphone app)... but only for a very, very small subset of games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a></em>. And <em>none</em> of those games are first-party Nintendo games.
</li><li> As part of its <em>Game for Windows</em> push, Microsoft hyped a feature called "Tray and Play", which allowed PC users to play their games as they were being installed, streaming it from the disc like on a game console. Despite some initial interest, the only game to make use of this feature was the much-loathed Vista PC port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>.
</li><li> The SuperGrafx was a short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductFacelift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductFacelift">Product Facelift</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCEngine">PC Engine</a> which boasted extra hardware while retaining full backward compability with the console's library and accesories. Although regular HuCards games could be programmed to take advantage of the SuperGrafx's specs, the only game to make use of this feature was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius">Darius</a> Plus</em> and its promotional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame">Boss Game</a> variant <em>Darius Alpha</em>, to reduce slowdowns and flickering.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a></em>, you can take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a> if you're holding an one-handed gun (such as a pistol) and use the "execution" key near a knocked-down enemy. It's rather hard to do unless you're specifically trying to pull it off (especially since two-handed guns are more common than one-handed ones) and most players complete the game without doing it even once (except to get one particular achievement). The feature was removed from the sequel.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe">Remember Me</a></em> has only a few memory-altering minigames, which is particularly egregious in that these puzzles were a major selling point for the game during the pre-release promotion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxterThePrecursorLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxterThePrecursorLegacy">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</a></em>: Red Eco, easily the least common, only appears in two or three places and is vastly overshadowed by the use of Blue and Yellow Eco. The ability to fire blasts from Yellow Eco in particular makes the doubled strength of Red Eco almost feel redundant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander">Jak 3: Wastelander</a></em>: One new feature that many fans felt was disappointing was the implementation of Jak's new Dark Eco ability of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">Invisibility</a>. Aside from a once-visited volcano level, it could only be used at the Monk's Precursor Temple monastery, thus meaning any use of it this for any stealth based tactics (or for that matter any sort of stealth-based missions) outside that location is denied to players. Granted while there is an unlockable ability to turn invisible by pressing the triangle button in Dark Jak form, but that only becomes available after completing the game (though it is somewhat subverted if someone buys it from the Secrets menu and then starts a New Game on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Hero Mode</a>).
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxterTheLostFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxterTheLostFrontier">Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier</a></em> has the Eco teleport ability, which allows Jak to switch places with Precursor statues and only those statues. It's used for a few puzzles and is impossible to use anywhere else (due to a lack of said statues), something that isn't true of the other Eco powers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>: In order to open access to Swamp Palace, you have to go into the Light World and open the floodgates in the shrine there, which will flood the first room in the Swamp Palace. This is the only instance of the player doing things in one world to change things in the other, despite all the potential puzzles it could allow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Din's Fire is a magic spell that sends out a shockwave of fire. It can be obtained quite early in the game, as the location is accessible by bombs, which you get by the second dungeon. However, Din's Fire is only required once to unlock the Shadow Temple, a fairly late game dungeon. Aside from one trap in the same temple (where even then it's optional), you'll never need Din's Fire for anything else ever again. The spell <em>can</em> be used to attack enemies, but you'll never really be swarmed by enough opponents to make this a better option than the usual sword fight. Plus, using them on Keese only sets them on fire instead of killing them, and many other enemies, even minor ones, are immune.
</li><li> Bombchu are mobile bombs that can crawl up the walls and ceiling, but the only time you ever actually need to use them is once in the Spirit Temple and in Ganon's Castle, both places being the last two dungeons in the game. It's simply easier to use regular bombs when you need to blow up something, especially as you can carry much, much more of those than you can Bombchus. The Master Quest version of the game does give Bombchus a bit more use, but not by a whole lot.
</li><li> The Boomerang. It is required for the third dungeon where it's found, used once or twice in the Spirit Temple, and never needed anywhere else other than a few Skulltulas that are out of reach for Link's child form. It cannot be used when Link is an adult, where the Hookshot takes its purpose (reaching distant targets).
</li><li> The Song of Storms is required to gain access to the Bottom of the Well and that's all it's ever used for outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, whereas all other songs get a lot of use as a means of teleportation or for mutliple puzzles. It's somewhat more useful in <em>Majora's Mask</em>: you only <em>need</em> it to make progress in Ikana Canyon, but it makes watering plants to grow them a lot less tedious (summon instant rain instead of having to go back and forth for bottles of water.)
</li><li> Diving in general. You only need to dive underwater a grand total of three times to advance in the game; first one is in the first dungeon where you need to reach a button, the second one is used for a diving mini-game to obtain the Silver Scale, and the third occurrence is using said Silver Scale to reach a bottle containing a letter underwater. You can completely skip the Golden Scale, which is only used <em>once</em> at Lake Hylia's lab to impress an NPC for a Piece of Heart. The Silver Scale also opens up a useful shortcut between the Lost Woods and Zora's River.
</li><li> The Iron and Hover Boots only get their most mileage out of the dungeons they were designed for (Water and Shadow Temples respectively). Ganon's Tower also makes use of them in their respective rooms, but that is it. Likewise, the Mirror Shield only gets any real use in the Spirit Temple and one section of Ganon's Castle, which are late to end game content. The Goron Tunic (heat protection) only has use inside the Death Mountain Crater and the Fire Temple while the Zora Tunic (underwater breathing) is only useful for the Water Temple. Blue Fire is only useful in the Ice Cavern, freeing a frozen King Zora, and one section of Ganon's Castle where the item's only purpose is to melt red ice. Light Arrows are obtained at the end of the game and are required, but it has zero use outside of its intended purpose and costs too much magic to kill stuff. The Ice Arrows, obtained fairly late in the game, can be completely skipped since they're optional. While freezing enemies is nice, there's nothing you don't have at that point that can do the same thing but faster.

</li><li> <em>Double Dash!!</em> has the Baby Park course, which is a small oval-shaped track where each lap can be done in 10-15 seconds.

Heck, even though the original <em>Super Mario Kart</em> is all 5-lap courses, they're retrofitted to 3 laps whenever they show up in later games.
</li><li> <em>Mario Kart 8</em> has two courses that are one long track divided into 3 sections to count off 3 "laps": Mount Wario and Big Blue (the latter of which is DLC). N64 Rainbow Road is similar in that the original course was a 3-lap circuit, but its <em>MK8</em> version divides the 3 laps across a single run of the track.

For a majority of characters, these are unlocked at random through normal gameplay. Only the Mii characters and Palutena have all of them available at the start, with all the specials they have being radically different. The nature of custom moves and Mii Fighters meant that they weren't allowed in online play unless with friends, and the competitive scene completely rejected them.

This stage didn't return in <em>Ultimate</em> despite the uniqueness, as it was likely a victim of the new Stage Morph feature (it would be tricky to transfer the fighters to the new stage if they were split between two planes of interaction).

</li><li> The first game has a wide variety of bonus room objectives (match the animal tokens, collect KONG letters, get through a platforming segment, stomp on a pair of ever-accelerating Klap Traps repeatedly until they're finally defeated, etc.), and furthermore just entering a bonus room counts towards completion percentage, so completing the bonus rooms is simply a fun optional challenge rather than being required for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100+% completion</a> like in subsequent games. Starting in the second game, bonus room objectives were reduced to a few types: three in <em>DKC2</em> (find the bonus coin, destroy all enemies, collect all stars), four in <em>DKC3</em> (<em>2</em>'s objectives, collect the green bananas), and <em>one</em> in <em>Returns</em> and <em>Tropical Freeze</em> (get all the bananas), with the last two games in particular reducing the number of bonus room environment types to one as well just to add insult to injury.
</li><li> Barrel cannons are more common in this game than the second and third, and many of them either rotate or move back and forth, but the kind that rotate <em>while</em> moving are found only in Snow Barrel Blast.
</li><li> DK has a Hand Slap move that's extremely situational, with almost no practical use. It's to the point that many players are not even aware of its existence and think that the similar special move he uses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> is an Smash original one instead.
</li><li> The second and third games have some rare barrel types, too.

In <em>3</em>, the rocket barrels and tracker barrels each show up in one level in Cotton-Top Cove as the level gimmick and nowhere else.

Most players use it once in the first level only to almost never use it again.
</li><li> Certain animal buddies have a very limited role. In the first game, Squawks only appeared in a single level, where his purpose was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteFlashlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfiniteFlashlight">light up your path</a>. However, later games gave him considerably more to do. In the second game, Squawk's original role was transferred to Glimmer the Angler Fish, who only appeared in one level as well. Quawks (the purple parrot) only appears in one level, while Bravo the Seal only shows up in two, and he essentially functions as a glorified stage element, cooling down the otherwise damaging hot water when jumped on and doing nothing else.

The problem is that there are only <em>five</em> of these (not counting mixing two Sleeps to get Ghost), you don't get the scrolls that let you create them until the last third of the game, and they're just elemental versions of Sword and Bomb, not providing much extra combat capability.

During gameplay, tapping an amiibo would give Kirby a specific copy ability depending on what amiibo was scanned (scanning Mario would give Kirby the Fire ability for example), or a random one if the figure wasn't supported. There were even special skins and rare abilities like Smash Bros. and UFO that could be received by scanning <em>Kirby</em>-series amiibo.

<ul><li> The Warp Pad is a gadget that lets you place a temporary location you can warp to at circular panels on the ground. There are 2 of these panels in the entirety of the game, which both appear in the same level, and one of them can be bypassed by using the Charge Boots instead. The only reason the item exists is to force you to complete Aridia first before progressing the story.

Since it's optional, players have often missed this and then stumble into a level soon after that requires them, for just one instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">causing many players to get stuck not knowing how to get past</a>.

While Clank uses them a <em>lot</em> in his own levels, they are eventually unlocked for Ratchet too... and he never has to use them, except if the player feels like slowing enemies down. Which you by no means have to, as by this point Ratchet's arsenal is about as powerful as it can possibly be, and no enemies are fast enough to require it. The reason for this is because the puzzles intended for this mechanic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">were cut for time</a>.

Even the game's official guide written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NintendoPower">Nintendo Power</a> laments that it appears nowhere else. The GBA version added an e-Reader level that uses Goomba's Shoe, but it wouldn't properly return until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker">Super Mario Maker</a></em>, where the shoe and variations of it can be added to levels.

Suit; beloved for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, but it has yet to return to the series, though it can at least be used in any level.
</li><li> Pink Note Blocks only appear in five levels, two of which are in World 1.
</li><li> World 8 has map gimmicks that aren't used anywhere else. The second map screen have level tiles you can skip over, but if you are unlucky, a hand will pull Mario in and you're forced to play the level. The third map screen is in complete darkness except for the small circle of light surrounding Mario. All this does is make navigating the map more tricky.

</li><li> Valley of Bowser 3 is the only one with the numbered platforms.
</li><li> The Sunken Ghost Ship uses a goal sphere (marked with a "?") to end the level instead of a goal tape or boss, similar to the ones dropped by minibosses in <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. It's the only level that does this, possibly because the last room of the level is vertical and regular goal points do not work correctly in vertical levels.

<ul><li> One of the last rooms in 4-4 has a 3D tilting board platform in the middle of the room over a lava pit. It seems to serve no purpose other than to make the last red coin more dangerous to collect (the room contains no enemies), and the sprite does not show up anywhere else in the game.
</li><li> There is also a strange pink round platform with a double arrow found only in a bonus room of 4-6.
</li><li> There is a variant of the flipping spike platform that has two platforms with a switch in the middle, and hitting the switch causes the platforms to rotate 90 degrees at a time and then pause. It's completely unused, despite being fully functional.
</li><li> The colored triangle-patterned moving platforms are in many levels in the game. However, the first room of 6-4 is the only place where you can find them with their alternate graphical style.
</li><li> Perhaps justifiably, 3-4 has an almost unique graphical tileset throughout the level (except for the very beginning because the tileset gets swapped a couple screens in); outside of it, the background is only found in one room of 3-3 and the foreground only in two small rooms in 6-4 (with a different palette to boot).
</li><li> The "Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest" minigame can be found behind one locked door in 2-6...and nowhere else in the game aside from the minigame cheat menu, unlike every other minigame, which all appear at least 3 times each in one form or another. (And it's a shame, since that was probably the most fun minigame of the bunch and is guaranteed to give you a Super Watermelon, which has 3 times as much ammo as a non-storable watermelon of the same type and cannot be obtained from any other minigame.)
</li><li> The ability to make Yoshi's eggs skip across water is only actually put to use in 3-8, including its boss battle.
</li><li> Really, in addition to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniqueEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniqueEnemy">Unique Enemies</a>, Yoshi's Island has a veritable myriad of these: the 3D falling drawbridges are only in 1-4, Melon Bugs are only in 1-7, the poundable red platforms are only in the last room of 1-7 and in one small part of 4-1, there's a type of platform ghost that appears only once in one room of 1-8 (as well as the one in the penultimate room of 5-4), the car morph only shows up in the last room of 2-7, the floating logs are only in the second room of 2-8, the inflatable balloon is only in 4-3 and a bonus room in 4-7, the ski lifts are only in 5-2 as the level's gimmick and in one section of 5-3, there's a unique Baron Von Zeppelin in 5-3 carrying a blue melon, the funny yellow squishy platforms are only in 5-4, the spinning logs are only in 6-3 as the level's gimmick, the pseudo-3D pipes are only in 6-4 (despite there being other pseudo-3D castle levels), there is only one numbered platform with a 4 on it that is found early in 6-7, and so on.
</li></ul></li><li> Unfortunately, the Wing, Metal and Vanish Caps from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> suffer from this. The Wing Cap, on top of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired">difficult to control</a>, is only needed for a few stars. The Metal Cap does make you near-invincible, but since platforming takes precedence over combat, it's basically just used for the odd puzzle here and there. The Vanish Cap is even more underutilized and basically just serves as a key to get a handful of stars, and it shows up in areas where its own invincibility properties are basically useless. The DS remake mitigates these somewhat by tying them to specific characters, though while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Luigi</a> is sure to get plenty of mileage out of it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">Wario</a> probably won't be seeing much use outside of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> or Wario/Metal Cap-specific stages anyway.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpMount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpMount">Yoshi</a>'s use is fairly limited. He has a host of abilities, but the only one that gets any real use is spraying juice on blockades. His flutter jump is outclassed by the FLUDD nozzles, and turning enemies into platforms is only utilized in a single mission, which also makes changing Yoshi's color (which creates different platform behaviors) unnecessary outside of another single mission. He doesn't even show up much, only being needed for about one episode per level (sometimes only to open up a secret stage) and some Delfino Plaza secrets.
</li><li> The FLUDD's Squirt and Hover Nozzles are critical to the gameplay as the default equipment, and the Rocket Nozzle's vertical boost is very convenient. The Turbo Nozzle, in spite of its water-running capabilities and speed boost, is not nearly as useful; levels are more vertical than horizontal, and since secondary nozzles are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePowerups" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePowerups">Mutually Exclusive Powerups</a>, it's hard to justify swapping out Hover or Rocket for it. Similar to Yoshi, it gets most of its usage as a key for Delfino Plaza secrets, and its only dedicated Shine Sprites are one in a bonus level and one in Delfino Airstrip.

<ul><li> The Blue Shell is fun to use due to its defensive capabilities, improved swimming ability and shell slide (also, nice to have the Blue Shell <em>not</em> be the object of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">fear and hatred</a> for a change), but it appears far too infrequently as it&#146;s absent from all normal ? blocks (while there&#145;s an enemy that drops it, said enemy only appears in a multiplayer stage), and none of the stages are really built around using it. It's also one of the few powerups that hasn't appeared in any other <em>New</em> series games, though the Penguin Suit is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a>.
</li><li> The game also has quite a few platform types that appear in only one level, even if there is no reason for them to be so rare. Among other examples, 1-2 is the only level with the see-saw logs, 1-Castle with tightropes, 3-A is the only one with the groups of 3 rotating platforms (despite the equivalent in Super Mario World being noticeably more common), 4-5 is the only one with the "drawbridge" platforms, and 6-3 is the only one with the large floating logs. At the end of 2-6, there is a pipe blocked by a cork that can be pumped up to pop the cork out, which never shows up again.

<ul><li> Red Stars give Mario the ability to fly indefinitely until they wear off and let him magnetize collectibles towards him by spinning. There are only two of these Stars in the whole game: one in the Gateway Galaxy in a Purple Coin mission, and the other in the Comet Observatory for reaching a few 1-Up Mushrooms (at a point where you won't need many since the final level is likely open already). They're never used in a boss battle, and they don't return in <em>Galaxy 2</em>.
</li><li> The Boo Mushroom lets Mario float and pass through grates, but is cancelled by light and causes Boos to chase him. It only shows up in three missions across three galaxies, none of them lasting very long, and it doesn't have a boss battle since it can't attack. In <em>Galaxy 2</em>, it's found in Boo Moon Galaxy for one mission and nowhere else.
</li><li> The Fast-Foe Prankster Comet only alters two missions in <em>Galaxy</em> (the other four Prankster Comets modify at least four missions each), both revolving around Tox Boxes, so it never gets to affect normal enemies or bosses. It's replaced by the Double-Time comet in <em>Galaxy 2</em>, which speeds up the level's obstacles instead of enemies, but this is also used for just two stars.

</li><li> The tiptoeing ability lets you walk on bridges made of Nitro Crates.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderTheSea">Under the Sea</a> levels have completely different controls, and Metal Pac-Man gets more use in bypassing fire/lava than for sinking into water.

Despite its incredible usefulness in exploring the levels and finding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Clue Bottles</a>, it's only used for that one mission and is then removed. Luckily, there is a cheat code unlocked at 100% completion that lets you assign the move freely, and you can use an Episode Restart code to replay any episode. It can even be used to force an entire game restart with all your current moves, including the Mega Jump!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em>, there's the Weapon Tank. In theory, the Weapon Tank is a very big help as it allows you to restore weapon energy when you've ran out. However, in practice, you'll probably rarely use it. For X, this is because this will be negated by the Helmet Part, which grants X unlimited ammo outside of Charged Shots. For Zero, this is because he only has one kind of attack that requires weapon energy, you'll only need it for one boss and it recharges itself via damage.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster">Tetris: The Grand Master</a></em> series introduced Initial Rotation System, which lets you pre-rotate the next piece by holding down the button corresponding to your desired rotation direction in the small delay between when a piece locks and when the next piece spawns. <em>Tetris: The Grand Master 3</em> introduces an offshoot of this called Initial Hold System, which lets you swap out the next piece with whatever is your current Hold piece immediately once said next piece spawns. Both features are extremely useful at high gravity but have not seen wide adaptation to main <em>Tetris</em> games, not even to such games that do feature maximum drop speed such as <em>Tetris DS</em>.
</li><li> <em>Tetris: The Grand Master 2</em> introduces "sonic drop", where you can quick-drop a piece but without locking it, making filling in overhangs much faster. (To compare, a "hard drop" instant-drops the piece and locks it in place immediately.) It has unfortunately never been used in a main <em>Tetris</em> game; you have to use the also-non-locking-but-slower soft drop instead.
</li><li> Double/co-op mode, where two players share one extra-wide field, can be a fun exercise for friends who like playing <em>Tetris</em> together, but very few <em>Tetris</em> games have it (Tengen's unlicensed NES port of Atari <em>Tetris</em>, <em>Tetris: The Grand Master 2 PLUS</em>, and <em>Tetris Kiwamemichi</em> which notably allows <strong>four</strong> players to use the same playfield at once).
</li><li> Until the late 90s, "lock delay" (pieces having a delay between when they touch down and when they become locked in place) was mostly exclusive to <em>Tetris</em> games by SEGA and Jaleco; the first game to include it is SEGA's 1988 <em>Tetris</em> arcade game. Nintendo's NES, non-Color Game Boy, and SNES <em>Tetris</em> games as well as Atari's arcade <em>Tetris</em> game and accompanying NES port, all of which are more well-known in the West, don't include lock delay despite being a good way to curb frustration at higher drop speeds.

<ul><li> A criticism that's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZokQov_aH0&amp;t=19m42s">sometimes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> said about the game is that the environment is seldom integrated into the main puzzles. Most puzzles involve drawing a line across a panel depending on symbols written on it, with only some areas involving the world itself into the puzzles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The environmental puzzles <em>are</em> completely dependant on the world, but that doesn't prevent some people from thinking the panel puzzles are lacking.</span>
</li><li> The Y symbol found in the quarry puzzles is seldom seen outside the quarry. There are <em>four</em> puzzles that use it: one in the ghost town, another in the windmill basement, another in the mountain ground floor (technically four, although they're all part of one, big puzzle), and another in the caves. That's it. The reason has probably to do with the way the game reutilises the symbols in areas different to the one that introduces them. In later puzzles, the game tends to combine several symbols to make more complex puzzles, or otherwise adding a gimmick that creates a variation on previously seen puzzles. However, by its own nature, the Y symbol <em>must</em> be combined with other symbols, which means its introductory area already exhausted all possible ways to combine it with other symbols, and its reliance on other symbols makes more difficult to add gimmicks specifically designed around it, as opposed to more simple symbols that can easily have gimmicks.
</li><li> Similarly, while tetrominos are used very often in puzzles, the blue, hollow tetrominos are seldom seen outside of the swamp (what's more, the swamp only uses them in the last puzzles). Again, only <em>three</em> puzzles use them: one in the vault near the desert ruins, another in an optional part of the treehouse area, and another in the caves. It's not clear why this happened, although <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWitness/comments/6c3fwx/polyomino_symmetry_violation_detected/">a theory<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> could explain it. It's been reported a glitch where, when pairing hollow tetrominos with the <em>exact</em> same number of solid tetrominos, the game automatically cancels them among themselves, without bothering to check if the shapes are also the same (as it does when the number of hollow and solid tetrominos isn't the same). This could lead to many unintended solutions, except that there was a good bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a>, and existing puzzles involving hollow tetrominos are carefully designed so that it's completely impossible to even input such a solution. However, the presence of this glitch may have forced the developers to reduce the number of puzzles involving those glitched tetrominos.

<ul><li> Bulbmin are a secret sixth type of Pikmin in <em>Pikmin 2</em>, being tiny Bulborbs controlled by parasitic Pikmin. Once freed from a wandering adult Bulbmin in a cave sublevel, they can be added to the squad and have immunity to the four elemental hazards. Unfortunately, it's impossible for them to leave caves since they can't go inside an Onion or the Hocotate Ship, so they get left behind unless you use a Candypop Bud to turn them into one of the other Pikmin types. They don't spawn if you have 100 Pikmin already, so you can only find them by entering a cave with a smaller group or by losing Pikmin beforehand. Finally, they appear in three of the fourteen caves plus two Challenge Mode levels; the sole place you can get good use out of them is the Submerged Castle, since only Blue Pikmin can enter it.
</li><li> Purple Pikmin and White Pikmin are left out of the story mode in <em>Pikmin 3</em>, instead appearing in Challenge Mode and Bingo Battle. In Challenge Mode, they're only used in some of the "Collect Treasure" stages, and they lose most of their powers from <em>Pikmin 2</em> (Purple Pikmin no longer stun or do high damage; White Pikmin have no poison obstacles or buried treasure to interact with, and deal much less damage to enemies who eat them), so they exist just to carry objects.

<ul><li> <em>Warcraft III's</em> "Spirits of Ashenvale" mission had a unique mechanic where it was possible to obtain lumber from destroying Night Elf tree structures, yet it's seen nowhere else throughout the game. Even though 3,000 lumber coming from Trees of Life sounds way overpowered, it makes sense in context when you realize that Night Elf structures that absorb the Wisp worker <em>are</em> technically trees.
</li><li> Sea warfare, which was a major component of <em>Warcraft II</em>, took a huge backseat by the time <em>Warcraft III</em> came around. It didn't exist in the original <em>Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</em> game, and while the <em>Warcraft III: Frozen Throne</em> expansion brought back naval combat ships, they were still limited to only being in the single-player campaign, and only for certain missions since it wasn't possible to build shipyards.

When one of your characters is knocked down with an elemental weakness (except for Joker), the negotiation mechanic forces you to either pay that enemy something, talk the enemy into letting them go, or do nothing and watch that party member get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">one-shotted</a>. However, the mechanic doesn't trigger in boss battles, and only rarely triggers in random encounters. A player might go through all of the seventy-plus hours of gameplay and never see this happen, despite getting passive bonuses that make it easier to get away with negotiation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, which lets you retain monster database information, makes it even less likely.
<ul><li> The garden sees far less use than in the previous game. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, the garden is unlocked in late May, and you could choose to plant many different types of crops, from tomatoes that can restore a small amount of SP to wheat that can open gold chests to eggplants that can protect you from instant-kill skills. In <em>P5</em>, the garden is unlocked at the end of October, near the end of the game, and you can only plant SP-restoring vegetables. <em>Royal</em> addresses this somewhat, adding two additional types of vegetables, which can grant a Charge or Concentrate effect when used on a party member, and makes the garden useful for longer as a result of adding another month of gameplay and a new Palace.

<ul><li> Steiner's Charge! skill has every party member with low HP attack an enemy without using a turn. While it would be incredibly handy, the fact that it only works on characters that are near death and the risk of said characters being knocked out being high makes the skill hardly used, if ever.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> is well-praised for its CTB (Conditional Turn-Based Battle) system, in which battles are turn-based and there is a window showing the timeline of turns for all combatants. When you highlight a skill that will influence when the character's next turn will come up (usually, more powerful skills will delay the next turn, weaker skills and item usage will make the next turn come sooner), the timeline will reflect the change, allowing you to better decide whether the skill is worth the change in the turn order. Despite being regarded as one of the best implementations of turn-based combat in the series, if not the entire genre, subsequent <em>Final Fantasy</em> games largely dropped it in favor of going back to real-time combat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts">Shadow Hearts</a></em>:

</li><li> <em>From The New World</em> explains "Will" as the good counterpart to Malice, and it's explained that too much Will is as bad as too much Malice. But there is no gameplay mechanic about Will <em>or</em> Malice.
</li><li> The vampires mechanics in <em>Covenant</em> and <em>From The New World</em> can feel this way too, if only because of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">little the game mentions them</a> or how utilizing it often uses rare and/or expensive in-game items.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> has this in spades, with the creators admitting that many mechanics and features are made with the idea that such things are going to be unique to that specific region or generation, in order to help differentiate them from other installments. Hence things like only Hoenn having secret bases, or replacing Gen VI's Player Search System with Gen VII's Festival Plaza.
<ul><li> Gen I: The Generation I games played around with the idea of being allowed to journey in multiple directions about halfway through the region, allowing the player to get the next few badges in whatever order they wish. The Gen II games, and the remakes for both these generations, are the only time this type of plot progression is present.
</li><li> Gen II:
<ul><li> The post-game content of <em>Gold and Silver</em>, where the player heads off to Kanto to see that region's timeline updated several years after Red's adventure is still considered by many fans to be one of the best approaches done for a Pok&eacute;mon endgame. Yet apart from the <em>HeartGold and SoulSilver</em> remakes, this was the only generation that allowed travel to a past region.
</li><li> Having the player character's mother save some of your money after every trainer battle was a neat idea and gave a sense of security if you happen to lose a battle (which resulted in you losing money). Other than saving up for a rainy day and having your mother buy random items and dolls for you, you could play the entire game without sending money to your mother without it affecting your gameplay. This mechanic wasn't brought back until the remakes.
</li></ul></li><li> Gen III:
<ul><li> The Vs. Seeker that was introduced in <em>FireRed and LeafGreen</em> was a great and simple item to use that allowed players to re-battle any trainer they've already come across, and possibly battle against new high-level teams. It made leveling up the player team's Pok&eacute;mon much easier, and feel like less of a chore. Yet after <em>Diamond, Pearl, Platinum</em>, this Key Item is dropped completely.
</li><li> The Battle Frontier, introduced in <em>Emerald</em>, has only seen two incarnations across three games (<em>Platinum</em> and <em>HeartGold and SoulSilver</em> used the same Battle Frontier). The Gen V games onward use the Battle Tower template for their post-game battle areas, lacking the unique gimmicks of the other attractions; infamously, the remakes of the Gen III games omitted the Battle Frontier in favor of recycling the Battle Maison from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em> features a Battle Factory-esque area, but doesn't bring back any other attractions.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Shadow Pok&eacute;mon</a> from the spinoff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Orre</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">duology</a>. They've only appeared in those games, and Shadow Pok&eacute;mon cannot be transferred to the mainline Gen III games until they are purified, removing their Shadow traits. Most of this is for balance reasons, as Shadow Pok&eacute;mon's mechanics make them very overpowered (<em>Colosseum</em> gave every Shadow a move that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental">ignored the target's type</a> and could randomly put them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Critical Hit Class</a> mode; <em>XD</em> includes many different Shadow moves, which can either be physical or special and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement">super-effective against anything that isn't also a Shadow</a>). Shadow Pok&eacute;mon do appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pok&eacute;mon GO</a>,</em> but without Shadow moves.
</li></ul></li><li> Gen IV:
<ul><li> Starting in the fourth-generation games, many Pok&eacute;mon species were given minor sprite differences for each gender, such as female Pikachu having heart-shaped tails while males had flat-gopped tails. This was the only time gender differences were applied on a mass scale, as future games typically only have one Pok&eacute;mon with notable dimorphism between genders (such as Unfezant, Meowstic, and Indeedee). Later games still maintain gender differences, but it's almost an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">artifact</a> since very few species introduced past the first four generations have differences.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">HeartGold and SoulSilver</a></em>, in order to make up for the lack of the Pok&eacute;tch, fills the bottom screen with shortcuts to menu options and an interact button. There's one button that toggles your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes">Running Shoes</a> so that you can run without holding down the B button. Since there's few times when running is a bad thing, this is very useful. However, as later games lessened the use of the touch screen, this toggling feature never returned. However, <em>Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee</em> and later games don't require it anyway, thanks to the Switch's analog stick.
</li><li> Key items exclusive to <em>HeartGold and SoulSilver</em> include Berry Pots (which let you grow berries on the go, instead of planting them in a single spot and having to remember where they are), and the GB Sounds device (letting you replace the remake's soundtrack with the soundtrack from the original games, which no other remake allows for).
</li></ul></li><li> Gen V: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em> introduced two new types of battles, Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. Triple Battles, as the name suggests, were a step up from Double Battles, where each side had three Pok&eacute;mon active at once; unlike Double Battles, positioning mattered, since Pok&eacute;mon on one end generally couldn't do anything to the Pok&eacute;mon on the other end, although you could switch a Pok&eacute;mon on the end with the one in the middle, adding an extra layer of strategy. Rotation Battles were similar in that each side had three Pok&eacute;mon out, but only one was active at any given time; in addition to attacking or using items, each side could rotate their active Pok&eacute;mon out as a free action, making Rotation Battles a major mind game. Neither battle variant ever had all that many NPCs that participated in them, and they never caught on competitively outside Japan, so both battle types were dropped by Gen VII.
</li><li> Gen VI:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em> introduced Inverse Battles which, as the name suggest, that inverts the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental Rock&#150;Paper&#150;Scissors</a> (Fire is strong against Water instead of resisted, Ghost can now hit Normal, etc.). While this was an interesting new take that drastically changed how almost every Pok&eacute;mon functioned, breathing new life into otherwise horrible ones in the process, it could only be used against one optional NPC. And there was almost no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">Player Versus Player</a> support for it. <em>Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</em> did expand their availability somewhat by letting players set their Secret Bases to use Inverse Battles, but that was about it. Just like triple and rotation battles, the following generation dropped them completely, though <em>Sun and Moon</em> oddly has an Inverse Battle quiz available in the Festival Plaza despite them no longer existing.
</li><li> <em>X and Y</em> also introduced another kind of gimmick battle, Sky Battles. Like the name suggests, Sky Battles take place high in the air, limiting the participants to using only Pok&eacute;mon that are Flying-types or have the Levitate ability, and using moves that don't involve some any kind of terrain. While Sky Battles were more common than Inverse Battles (or Triple and Rotation Battles, for that matter), they were still all optional and not eligible for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">Player Versus Player</a> matches. Furthermore, it wasn't very intuitive on which Pok&eacute;mon would actually be eligible to participate; if the Pok&eacute;mon's idle animation had it standing or sitting on the ground, it was disqualified regardless of its typing or ability. Apparently having two sets of idle animations for a given species wasn't an option, because a number of species got unpopular changes to their previous idle poses to make them eligible for Sky Battles; unfortunately, while Sky Battles never made it out of their game of origin, the idle pose changes have persisted for much longer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> have Horde Trainer Battles. These were hyped up a fair amount in the trailers, and it felt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCombatPragmatist">very in-character</a> for villainous team grunts to gang up on the player. Unfortunately, there are a grand total of <em>two</em> Horde Trainer Battles in the entire game: one in the Team Magma/Aqua Hideout during the main story, and one in the postgame Delta Episode. There aren't any repeatable battles that use this mechanic, and (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">say it with me</a>) it isn't available for PvP.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolution</a> was a big selling point for Gen VI as a whole, and about half of the game's plot focuses on it. Despite this, there's a decent chance you won't end up using a Mega Evolving Pok&eacute;mon on your final team. In <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, only two Mega Stones are given to you outright (your Kanto starter and Lucario), and there are only four other stones<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10z98t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10z98t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10z98t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">plus one with the event-only Blazikenite, plus another two with the other Kanto starter stones you can buy</span> that you can get during the main game. The other seventeen or so can be gotten in the post-game, which is infamously short by <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> standards. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> fixes this; in addition to adding more Mega Stones, you're able to get over twenty of them during the course of the main game (though you're only able to use Mega Evolution for about half of it).
</li><li> You can ride Pok&eacute;mon in <em>X and Y</em>, for the first time outside of Surf. However, there's only three to ride on, all are limited to one area each, and two of them are slow and cumbersome to control, so it feels like a throwaway gimmick. The Gen VII games would properly implement this with the Pok&eacute;mon Ride system.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em> caused this to happen to Mega Evolution again. While it makes sense since <em>Sun and Moon</em> have a host of other new mechanics to take the center stage (i.e. Z-moves, Ride Pok&eacute;mon, etc.), fans were still disappointed that no new ones were even introduced. It doesn't even get any significant mention until the post-game, and you only get a single one (Alakazamite) for free. To make matters worse, more than half of them weren't even available in the game at all until GameFreak released them through specially events. The rest must be bought with Battle Points you earn playing in Battle Royales or the Battle Tree. For how much it was promoted both in the games and the anime during Gen VI, the Mega Evolution concept's shift from a hyped new mechanic to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in the <em>very next installment</em> of the series is somewhat jarring. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> at least makes all Mega Evolutions available (though some are version exclusive) but there are still no new ones.
</li><li> <em>Sun and Moon</em> brought back Johto's Apricorn Balls much to the surprise of a lot of fans... until you realize that it's only possible to obtain one of each ball. It leaves you wondering why the makers couldn't add some sort of stall or shop in order to purchase more.
</li><li> Some have argued that <em>Sun and Moon's</em> picture-taking mini-game doesn't quite reach the complexity and uniqueness that defined <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSnap">Pok&eacute;mon Snap</a></em>.

</li><li> After their popularity during Gen VI, it was a bit of a surprise that <em>Sun and Moon</em> dropped Horde Battles completely; the mechanic would have fit in perfectly, since Pok&eacute;mon from Alola are said to help each other out a lot. Instead, it got replaced by SOS Battles, which were less useful for EV training and often made catching Pok&eacute;mon needlessly frustrating.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> For a time, the game had elemental resistances, which were in the game since 1.0. When the game was remade as <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, the elemental stats were extremely downplayed to the point where you'd be forgiven for not even knowing that it was even in the game. While you could meld a ton of elemental materia to your gear so that you could take less damage to an element, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">you'd also be sacrificing other stats like critical hits and spell speed</a>. Only a handful of boss fights utilized elements, and even then, the fights were scripted so you didn't even need to bother with elemental materia for those fights. The elemental stats stuck around for years until sometime after the <em>Stormblood</em> expansion where it was removed entirely from the main game and given a slight retool to be used for the Eureka content.
</li><li> The game had elemental potions which temporarily boosted your resistance to an element. Like with the elements in general, the elemental potions saw very little use and they were eventually removed from the game. Players who still had the potions could use them to obtain various pigments so that they can craft dyes of various colors.
</li><li> There are potions that can cause a variety of status effects on enemies when used. However, the strongest version of these potions only work up to enemies at level 50. Unlike regular healing potions and ethers that gotten stronger versions in each expansion pack, the status inducing potions never received any updates, thus they go unused.
</li><li> Adventurer Squadrons were introduced in <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, a side quest system that allowed the player to create a squad of NPC units that you could level up, train, send on missions, and even customize. Despite being a mechanic that has some amount of customization, the entire process has been largely ignored after release save for being able in <em>Stormblood</em> to take them into dungeons to level them up. They are currently capped at level 60, the max level for <em>Heavensward</em>, the first expansion, and has gotten no updates as of <em>Shadowbringers</em>, the third expansion.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em> is positively littered with mechanics that were introduced and then faded from attention later on as the Dev team focused on the next big thing.
<ul><li> The base game included Fellowship Maneuvers (originally called Conjunctions, or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CJs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CJs">C Js</a>): Powerful team moves that required each member of a Fellowship to input a different type of command that resulted in an overall attack/heal/power restore/etc. The developers felt that usage of these maneuvers by skilled players trivialized certain boss fights, so their power was cut down in the next expansion to only be slightly better than normal attacks. After that, the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMs">F Ms</a> unintentionally became something of a suckers move as the damage from a successful team attack became less than the team members simply continuing to attack normally, something that has only gotten exponentially worse since then as the effects never scaled properly. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FMs">F Ms</a> were reintroduced as a major mechanic in the Dunland expansion for one Raid Battle, but are otherwise considered useless since then.
</li><li> At about the same time, the developers introduced helper quests to encourage assisting certain characters with quests that were otherwise no longer popular. The most common of these were the class-specific quests in the 6 Moria 6-man instances. This idea was never announced very strongly, was inconvenient due to needing to go to a remote physical area to pick up/turn in the quests, gave only middling rewards anyway, and was never implemented past the Moria expansion. It is simply way more common to ask a kin-member or World Chat for help, especially since the instances in question could be trivially completed in about 5-10 minutes by a higher-level character.
</li><li> Skirmishes were strongly introduced with the Mirkwood expansion, and three instances from the Moria expansion were reworked to become skirmishes. Volume Three and the Dunland expansion added two additional skirmishes, and thus the most recent skirmishes are almost ten years old. However, Skirmishes actually did stay fairly popular for years afterwards as they provided relatively light-weight challenges for kin-members or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PUGs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PUGs">PU Gs</a> to do group activity while also getting rewards such as Marks, Medallions, gold, XP, and deeding, and you could occasionally get some decent gear at the Raid level. Unfortunately, the gear that drops from them now is stuck at level 100 (current level cap is 130), and thus is considered junk.
</li><li> There are other miscellaneous things including Warsteeds, Hobbies, Epic Battles, etc. that were introduced but later see little attention.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld">The Secret World</a></em> has some players feel this about the investigation quests. The player base tends to remember these quests first when talking about the game, albeit sometimes for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a> nature of some of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> managed to avert this after a few years in several ways. Originally, Naxxramas was considered to be a <em>very</em> good dungeon mechanics wise, but the steep barrier to entry meant most of the playerbase would never see it. In addition, several dungeons that are rarely run anymore had unique mechanics that newcomers (or people who missed them in the day) would never see. However, Naxxrammas was moved to the entry level raiding dungeon in Wrath, and several mechanics have actually been incorporated into other bosses since then.

Originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">Bioware wanted for the taint to infect all of the companions, meaning the player would have to make them into a Grey Warden</a>.

</li><li> Origins also had a unique mechanic during the Fade portion of the Mage quest where the player "shapeshifts" between several different creatures in order to solve the puzzle to escape the Fade realm. However, not only is this mechanic seen at just one point throughout the game, the player never gets to have that good of an experience playing around with the shapeshifting since it's used during said Fade portion, which is considered one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyLevel">least liked parts to play through</a> in the game.
</li><li> Post-<em>Origins</em>, the Rogue class' iconic Stealth ability becomes practically useless, since your non-stealthy party members are hard-wired to follow you even if you order them to stay back. Its only use is to quickly de-aggro yourself when surrounded and to shift positions, similar to the Tactical Cloak in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>. In <em>DAO</em>, by contrast, a good enough rogue could scout out the entire map, stealthily disarming traps right under the enemies' noses and thus making upcoming fights a lot easier.

Worse, there's functionally no difference between being fully trained in Guile (which improves stealth) and putting no points into it at all.
</li><li> Players can show off their trophies to earn additonal renown.

However, renown is extremely easy to earn by completing quests or simply killing monsters.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>
<ul><li> The RPG aspect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> took a major back seat for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> where players were vastly limited in the number of weapons, armor, mod upgrades and character progression they come across throughout the games. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> attempted to strike more of a balance between how the previous two games went about its RPG elements, especially with the much appreciated return of mod upgrades, but was still nowhere close to the amount of role-playing mechanics that the first <em>Mass Effect</em> had.
</li><li> The first game featured "Spectre Master Gear", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">high-end weapons</a> which were sold at the C-Sec Academy/Requisitions Officer on the Normandy (and at your apartment, once the <em>Pinnacle Station</em> DLC is completed), and could only be acquired by amassing more than 1 million credits and being at least Level 50. Come the sequel, these weapons completely disappeared and no further reference was made to them, despite the player having opportunities to accept/reaffirm their Spectre status in the sequels and presumably having access to top-of-the-line weapons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, usage of the Hammerhead being limited to DLC, such as the <em>Firewalker Pack</em> and <em>Project: Overlord</em> content, really limited the vehicle gameplay that the first <em>Mass Effect</em> had much more of when it came to driving around in the Mako. It then got even worse with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> where vehicle gameplay was practically non-existent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> had the War Asset Map. The game makes you believe that gathering up armies all across the galaxy was going to lead up to one massive all-out battle on Earth that took into account the choices that were made regarding each bit of asset that was added into the player's army that Shepard brings to Earth. Apart from a few minor <em>cinematic</em> differences, this wasn't the case one bit. None of the war assets gathered up have any effect on the gameplay.
<ul><li> Notably averted by the <em>Priority Earth Overhaul</em> mod, which was designed largely to give a purpose to many of the game's major War Assets during the final mission (in contrast to their non-appearance in the vanilla game). The London Hub is expanded with additional units, races and encounters, the Rachni will show up to help Shepard and their squad during the No Man's Land sequence, and the Destiny Ascension will be blown up if it was previously saved in the first game. However, the mod also plays this trope partially straight, as it will give status updates as to War Asset losses (largely done to Alliance forces) that don't actually change the War Asset score, but were simply put in for immersion.

Actual gameplay consists of a series of scripted missions involving fighting against either predetermined enemy arrangements, or quasi-random spawns of predetermined ship types, to achieve a specific objective. The same AI and game engine could easily have been used to make a more free-flowing and dynamic conquest game, where you destroy enemy units (and outposts?) to secure enemy-held locations (planets?), possibly for benefits such as additional friendly spawns or technology.

This ability hasn't appeared in any other game in the series (summoned monsters in <em>Gaiden</em> were AI controlled), only three characters can become Summoners and of those, one is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Trainee</a> who takes a long time to get there and another can only be obtained by completing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">three times.</a>

<ul><li> The ability to talk to certain units on the battlefield(usually allied green units, but also some enemies). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, this was a crucial way of recruiting units, and sometimes obtaining items from friendly NPCs, and both games provided brief tutorials introducing the mechanic. <em>Three Houses</em>, however, features this mechanic much less frequently, and there are few cases in which it gives anything more than some optional dialogue.
</li><li> Dark Seals, unique promotion items that allow access to the Dark Mage and Dark Bishop classes. The issue is the classes are male-only, and among the three characters who learn Dark magic (Hubert, Edelgard and Lysithea) only one of them is male, and Hubert is only playable on one of the game's paths... which happens to be the path where Dark Seals are the least accessible. And many of the skills benefiting Dark magic are also learned by Dark Knight, a class anyone can access.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony">Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</a></em>
<ul><li> The game introduced the ability to lie during trials. By holding down the button to fire a Truth Bullet, it turns into a Lie Bullet with the inverted meaning- for example, Character A's testimony about seeing Character B turns into testimony denying seeing Character B. While lies are required at several points in class trials, apart from that, they can only be used in a handful of points to unlock alternative ways of advancing the discussion. Only two or three times does the player actually have to lie (one of which being the tutorial of how to use lies), while the other times, lying is optional and in fact, pretty counterintuitive to use and has the terrible side effect of costing your health while you're aiming, which makes the player not want to use it anyway.
</li><li> In a stark departure from the previous games, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you actually have two playable characters this time around. You start off the game playing as Kaede Akamatsu, before switching to Shuichi Saihara midway through the first trial, with ends with Kaede being executed for the murder. While Kaede has her own Free Time Events with her classmate, she's only playable in Chapter 1 and can't be chosen in School Mode, which means you'll have to play Chapter 1 repeatedly to fill out her Free Time Events. Some players even wanted to be able to play as Kaede for the entire game or choose whether to play as Kaede or Saihara.</span>
</li><li> At the end of each trial, you can choose who to vote for as the culprit. For the most part, the rest of the cast realizes who's responsible, and even the culprit knows that they're finished, so your vote doesn't affect anything. The only real significance of this feature comes up at the end of the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when you must refuse to vote (which is punishable by death) in order to cause the killing game to end without hope or despair winning</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Justice for All</em> and <em>Trials and Tribulations</em> give you the ability to present profiles as evidence in court or when talking to people during investigations. The issue is that the times where profiles are needed are slim to the point where you can easily forget that you need to present profiles to progress. Later games would restrict profiles to only being used when it's required to do so.
</li><li> The first case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em> features a 3D diagram of the crime scene in the first case that you can manipulate in the courtroom to see possible contradictions. Despite being potentially useful, it was sadly not used after this particular case.
</li><li> Apollo's "Perceive" ability lets him focus on a witness's body language to see if there's a tic he can spot, which clues him in on the witness hiding something. The mechanic is used a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, but in later games, it's barely used at all; for example, in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, Apollo uses it during his investigations, but Blackquill refuses to allow him to use it during trials, until the final case (in his original game, there was at least one cross-examination per case that could only be solved through Perceive).
</li><li> The DLC case from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney &#150; Dual Destinies</a></em> boasts the comeback of the forensic investigation we saw back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Rise from the Ashes</a> and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice</a></em>... except it was simplified as heck. Luminol tests now need a single spray on the right area to reveal the bloodstain (as opposed to the multiple touches you had to do before), and the fingerprint search and analysis is done for you by another character while you're in court.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Gyakuten Kenji 2</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Fingerprinting</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">is back</a>! And it's used exactly once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsAceAttorney">Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney</a></em>: Puzzles with Contradictions. The concept in and of itself is an amazing new twist on the formulas of both original series, but it is only used once in the entire game, albeit at a critical point. Also, you are again able to present profiles in cross examinations, but it's never used.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinraiBrokenBeyondDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinraiBrokenBeyondDespair">Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair</a></em>
<ul><li> While the game is somewhat short, there's only three sequences in which you investigate areas. One is an optional tutorial in which you look at the decorations around the party area.. The second is a fairly simple puzzle the first time Raiko goes to the breaker room (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Open the window, check the breaker, check the shelves, get the broom to retrieve Raiko's cell phone, check the shelves again for a screwdriver and open the breaker</span>). The third is the investigation of the crime scene.
</li><li> There is also only <em>one</em> occasion in which you have to select a certain spot on an image (a fairly common puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa">Danganronpa</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>), namely at the end where you choose <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which room was the crime scene</span> (and if you get it wrong, someone else will point out the right answer). Said mechanic could have been used earlier on, when pointing out how Rie got back from the breaker room so quickly, but instead, it's a simple evidence presentation prompt.
