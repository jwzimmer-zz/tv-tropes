The necessary explanation seems to be that they've got very, very good insurance, that will take care of <em>everything</em>, including the costs of cleanup, repair, and presumably fat settlements for the people who want to sue the hero's spandex-clad bottom off. Of course, there's also the matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>: even if you wanted to sue Superman for damages, who exactly are you supposed to file your case against?
</p><p>At worst, the hero will face an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifesaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifesaving">Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving</a> speech at the end, but often there's not even that.

</p><p>This trope often occurs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">Mis-blamed</a>, in that peoples' anger is wrongly directed at the hero, rather than at <em>the villain who caused the trouble in the first place.</em> Civilians who whine about rescues they don't like can often come across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastards</a> when it doesn't seem to occur to them that they could end up enslaved, dead or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">worse</a> if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a> and the hero doesn't stop them.
</p><p>This is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> with the heroes actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">mentioning</a></em> that they've got insurance that will cover this&mdash;and is actually a specific rule featured in the old Comics Code&mdash;but it's unclear how any insurance company could do this and still turn a profit. Logically, they shouldn't be able to pay for the on-panel destruction unless they are also collecting mammoth premiums from many other superheroes who <em>don't</em> make big claims. So whenever Superman punches through a wall, somewhere, a less-violent hero like Oracle sees her premiums go up? That money has to come from somewhere! Other times the handwave comes from the fact that the hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">is a billionaire</a> and could pay for the rebuilds.

In less serious works, this trope can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInsuranceGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInsuranceGag">Action Insurance Gag</a>.
</p><p>However, many countries <em>do</em> have laws in place that prevent someone from being held liable for damage caused while saving someone's life. In the USA they are known as Good Samaritan laws. Such laws probably wouldn't apply in some of the more extreme cases of "heroic" destructiveness but is likely an easy enough excuse in situations where the damage caused is minor or where the threat stopped is sufficiently important. However, in some cases like bank robberies and other types of theft, stopping the villain always ends up costing more than just writing off what was stolen.
</p><p>At times, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> will pay for most damages and unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilaritySues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilaritySues">Hilarity Sues</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> prevents this trope, heroes will <em>never ever ever</em> have to pay.

<ul><li> Averted on at least one occasion where Edward finishes a battle that causes impressive collateral damage, only to be made to clean up after himself by irate shopkeepers. Fortunately, he lives in a setting where powers are as good at fixing messes as they are at making them.
</li><li> In another instance, he wrecks a woman's balcony during a big fight. He apologizes mid-battle, and promises to come back and fix it. Later he does fix it (to the woman's surprise) although given his sense of... style, it's debatable whether it's better than it was before.
</li><li> Double-subverted when he and Roy have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel">Wizard Duel</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mustang and Edward end the episode cleaning up the damage with shovels, no alchemy in sight</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> the reason why the Bebop crew is always starving or using sub-par equipment is because a good chunk of the cash they make off of their bounties is used to pay for the collateral damage they tend to leave in their wake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted. The heroes are pirates to begin with, so if they destroy buildings the Navy will respond to it. Normally, the Straw Hat Crew is able to survive their encounters with the Navy. However, if they do commit a serious crime their bounties could increase.
</li><li> Also averted when Luffy wrecks a restaurant staffed mostly by former pirates, who make him work off the damage.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Moldiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Moldiver">Moldiver</a></em>, where not only does the city have to pick up the tab for repairs after superbattles, it contracts them out to the lowest bidder &mdash; who happens to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in his civilian identity, and who is driven to distraction by the escalating levels of damage cutting into his profit margin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>:
<ul><li> The titular robot, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> whose pilot is sometimes guilty of causing just as much damage, if not more, while fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> than the monster could cause all by itself. Sometimes entire blocks are razed, but the massive destruction is never really brought up. It's lessened a little by the fact that Paradigm City is fairly underpopulated &mdash; a lot of the buildings are entirely deserted, or ruined anyway.
</li><li> It's not just fighting monsters either. The act of just <em>deploying</em> Big O and returning it to its "hangar" causes <em>huge thousand-feet-deep craters</em> to be dug all over the place, and nobody seems to care.
</li><li> The manga version of <em>The Big O</em> hangs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshade</a> on it: Beck's flunkies, who lack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenVillainDarkMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenVillainDarkMatter">Offscreen Villain Dark Matter</a>, are seen working construction repairing some of the damage afterwards in order to make some quick money.
</li><li> Hinted that the main reason Dastun wants to find out the identity of the black Megadeus is to put an end to the constant damage.
</li><li> I thought this was the job of all those maintenance men during the Season 2 finale arc who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fix the near completely ruined Big O before the final battle</span>. It would certainly explain why damage never carries over, given how fast they are! It's implied that constantly having to dig out from under rubble is why a lot of people have <em>jobs</em> in that universe.
</li><li> That doesn't do anything for all the times Big O makes a huge hole in the road, though...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> episode 13 when Sailor Mars wants to blast some airplanes being used by the villain and Luna replies that she could never afford to pay for the damage. The joke actually made it through to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC">DiC</a> English dub.
</li><li> Despite not quite being the genre for this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster">He Is My Master</a></em> subverts this by having the main character's lack of Hero Insurance driving the plot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light</a></em>. After Anubis' defeat, Kaiba leaves in a huff, and Grandpa says, "I'm glad he didn't bring up the damage you all did to his Duel Dome, because I really don't think his insurance is gonna pay for it!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaiGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DaiGuard">Dai-Guard</a></em>, where the company that owns the title giant robot is responsible for all collateral damage the robot causes, and numerous insurance-related forms have to be signed before it can be deployed.

And when one considers that the only other way to destroy the monsters besides the eponymous giant robot is with <em>nukes</em>, the insurance complaints seem rather inane.

Two of the characters are insurance society representatives who stick around to keep an eye on him and fail miserably at keeping him out of trouble, and in the fifth episode of the anime, a character mentions that "Class G Property Damage" contributed to Vash's enormous bounty.
</li><li> In the end, the Bernardelli Insurance Company just washes its hands of Vash, and declares any and all damage caused by him "Acts of God." Justified, since he accidentally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blew a chunk out of one of the moons; at that point, you can't really call him anything else</span>.

Vash somehow managed to avoid killing a single soul when he blew up an entire city... but it probably would have been kinder if he <em>had</em> vaporised the population, because almost every last man, woman and child either died of thirst/starvation or was murdered for their supplies by their desperate fellows.

He eventually blows over about this, destroying more of the city with his humongous mecha whilst demanding why no one will praise him for saving their lives, oblivious to the fact that he his in fact being a bigger threat to people's safety than the bad guys. After his friend is killed by another humongous mecha, he goes into a rage and nearly obliterates the city in his rampage. Later he is called out on his behaviour, being told to his face that his selfish actions have done more harm than good, and that if anyone is to blame for his friend's death, it's him.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X</a></em>, the good guys create a barrier/parallel dimension to protect the battle zones which in this case can't be considered collateral damage, tearing down the buildings is the primary objective of the bad guys. If the good guys die, the area retains the damage from the battle. Note that the good guys have an unimpressive track record for "winning". Also, it's not just "death" that dissolves the barrier. Loss of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSpirit">Heroic Spirit</a>, like that endured by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subaru</span> still results in the damage being permanent.

</li><li> Generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> where the Shinigami have the ability to stand on air, which they generally use to keep their battles high above the cities to lower the collateral damage. In the latest arc they've even gone as far as replacing the town with an exact replica of it so they can have an all out war without worrying about breaking anything. They have broken things before, like during Ikkaku's fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the arrancar Edorad Leones</span>. However it was mentioned that Soul Society fixes everything afterwords, with the costs being taken out of the budget of the squad responsible.

Apparently up to and including buildings being chopped to pieces. Naturally, this doesn't stop Negi from worrying about it anyway. The implication seems to be that the loser(s) of the fight is made to pay for the damages. One has to wonder what happens if the loser ends up dead, if that's the case.

</li><li> <em>End of Evangelion</em> opened to the image of Tokyo-3 after all of the battles had come to an end. With funding drying up, Tokyo-3 hasn't seen any repairs recently and most of the civilian population has fled.
</li><li> It's not even a question of funding. The destruction of Eva-00 was a bigger explosion than any of the previous battles.

</li><li> There's almost nobody living in the city to begin with. Misato appears to be the only person actually living in her building, most wide shots of the city show little, if any, traffic, and almost every classroom in Shinji's school is empty... and this is <em>before</em> things start getting bad. Dialogue halfway through the series suggests that the population is down to actual NERV employees and a few diehards. It's only in the Rebuild movies that Tokyo-3 is ever depicted as having an appropriate population level for a city that size.

Throughout the series, the main characters routinely cause enormous amounts of property damage in the city while attempting to apprehend criminals, sometimes failing to make an arrest in the end. This never results in any member of the tank police being arrested, fired, or disciplined, other then occasionally getting chewed out by a supervisor.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>: It turns out that someone actually <em>does</em> pay for all that property damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Shizuo</a> causes: his manager (not Tom, but another guy above both of them), who docks it from Shizuo's salary in return.

Kankichi Ryotsu defeats the villain and saves the day, but gets billed by the owners for property damage he caused or blamed for it. Notably the Fuji TV station <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor">(the show's broadcaster)</a> being destroyed multiple separate times. Thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a> or possibly Ryotsu's gambling winnings, everything's back to normal and forgotten in the following episode.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>. Damages incurred by a superhero must be paid for either by his/her sponsor company or the hero him/herself. In the very first episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour">Kotetsu</a>, the protagonist, is berated for damaging a monorail track in order to stop a hijacker. And in episode 5 he is brought before a judge who rules that his company be fined for the property that was destroyed during one of his rescue attempts in episode 4. To be precise, the city pays for any damage deemed necessary for the hero to capture a criminal and/or protect civilians. However, anything the city deems unnecessary is billed to the hero's sponsor company. So a hero who pulls a chunk out of the road in order to stop a bystander being shot would not be charged, but a hero who stomps a car's roof in when he could have just run around it would be charged. All of the heroes in the show are employees or owners of companies which use the hero's "brand" to generate money, so that they don't personally have to pay these charges (and also to generate a living wage for them, as they aren't directly paid to be heroes). One of the reasons co-protagonist Wild Tiger is nicknamed the "Crusher for Justice" is due to his habit of smashing things up with his super strength and earning himself a constant stream of large bills for his sponsor company to pay. The show actually begins with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his original sponsor company going out of business due to the large bills he receives. The only reason he agrees to be in a partnership with Barnaby is because the next company to hire him tells him to do it or quit, and implies that no other sponsor company would agree to take on a hero who's fame (and ability to generate money) is waning but continues to rack up such large bills.</span>

When they point out to her that she does the same thing regularly when going on missions, she replies that in that case she is backed up by the said government agency which controls and compensates the damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> usually plays it straight, but it's averted when Allen gapes at a massive hole Lavi puts in a building using his Size-Shifting Hammer and Lavi carelessly mentions not to worry about it and that Komui will 'foot the bill.' Apparently the Vatican have very deep pockets, considering the damage the Exorcists tend to create during their fights.
</li><li> One of the reasons Train and Sven from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> are so poor is because most of their bounty money is used to pay for damage they cause when catching criminals.

Not to mention he couldn't hold a job due to this...
</li><li> A short omake at the end of episode 13 shows Mephisto confronting Amaimon on the destruction he caused in his fight with Rin. Scratch that, he was just upset over the now-headless statue of him. The wrecked rollercoaster and ball pen are totally over looked.

D.C. has been shown to clean up very specific examples of property damage, enlisting the help of subcontractors. In the after-effects of the <em>Civil War</em>, its created-for-the-story new CEO is shown to have helped cause damage so the company gets hired to fix it. And they also dealt with the aftermath of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">World War Hulk</a></em>, explaining why New York wasn't rubble just days after it was smashed.
<ul><li> It's mentioned a few times that New York City has a huge insurance policy specifically covering damage from supervillain attacks.

Ever. Amadeus Cho even claimed that Hulk didn't kill any <em>military</em>, either.
</li><li> In one issue, Hulk and his teammates devastated a space launching bay because they didn't want America to interfere with Hulk's son. When called about it, Banner said they killed no one, and rebuilding all of this would <em>create jobs!</em> (If bombing expensive high-tech construction was a good way to create jobs, terrorism <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">would fix economies</a>).

Lex Luthor of all people calls out from the crowd, asking why he thinks he can just leave Metropolis with the cleaning bill. Superman arrives and actually sides with Lex, saying that he always sticks around to clean up after battles.
</li><li> Superman himself has actually been <em>shown</em> cleaning up after his particularly destructive battles. After Superman got his powers back post-Infinite Crisis and he and Lex Luthor had a huge smash-up in Metropolis, Supes was shown clearing debris and doing minor construction work (i.e. welding some support beams to the side of a slightly-damaged building to prevent it collapsing) potentially saving the city millions of dollars and months or years of work fixing the damage. In the Golden and Silver Age stories, more often than not, he would repair even minor damage with super speed after he caused it.

</li></ul></li><li> This was a major plot point in a <em>Flash</em> storyline where Wally gets legally barred from Keystone City because of all the collateral damage that results from his everyday crime fighting. In order to make their case the city authorities even have accountants following him around and calculating the damage done in front of him. Also explained in another issue... where's it's pointed out that Wally is GREAT at construction... as he can build a bridge in minutes. Though, he does note that it's 'quick and dirty'... but, well... he could fix it up later.
</li><li> In an earlier of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> where accountants were talking to the team, trying to account for all the damage caused during a fight with elemental golems. Most of the Avengers were dismissive about it, Thor left a bag of gold, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> reminded them that he was Tony Stark and could pay for it, and Cap... Cap handed over the parking ticket and the badge number of the officer who had ticketed the Quinjet when he'd made an emergency landing in an illegal zone. And the paperwork for having taken something out of a prison without filling in forms beforehand. The accountants loved him. An Avengers annual had the heroes touring a construction site. The employees knew villains would not be far behind (it <em>is</em> a construction site) and indeed, they showed up. Without the heroes knowing, the employees put the smack down on all the bad guys.

Once they are done the mayor of New York scolds them, sentencing them to... community service. Well, they <em>are</em> the Avengers. Fighting the next threat probably counts.
</li><li> In the "Guardian Devil" arc for Marvel Comics character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, DD mentions that New York City has a billion-a-year insurance policy on damages caused by superheroes.

One character's girlfriend was graphically killed in front of him by a speedster throwing another superhuman into her, right after they traded "I love yous" for the first time. Of course, <em>The Boys</em> is, depending on who you ask, a deconstruction or just one long bitchfest about superheroes in general. While heroes in other genres might at least make token attempts to minimize property damage or justify it with equal contributions, the superpowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a> of The Boys just don't care and would slaughter a million civilians to apprehend a jaywalker.

Also somewhat unique in that the Authority often acknowledges that what they're doing will cause property damage and probably cost civilian lives. The characters justify it with the excuse that the bad guys would have done much worse if nobody had stopped them, but the fact that they <em>openly acknowledge</em> the cost of what they do is unique in itself.
</li><li> There was an amateur comic in <em>Svenska Serier</em> where villain and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>, both musclebound bricks, bust out against each other at a high-class party, tearing the place up in the process. The destruction soon rises to ludicrous levels until they suddenly call it off and don their civilian disguises. The manager of the party at the introduction, now the only apparent survivor who is sobbing on his knees in the midst of the destruction, is then approached by two surprisingly muscular suits who inform him that the insurance policy they provide would be excellent should something like this happen again.
</li><li> This trope is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> or parodied in the Marvel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">What If</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisherKillsTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisherKillsTheMarvelUniverse">The Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe</a></em>.

As he makes his plan, Alfred notes that Wayne Enterprises will likely be making a donation to the water board the next day.

John Stewart, a long-standing human GL &mdash; and more importantly, an architect in his day job &mdash; cleans up the skyscraper damage in Coast City all by himself.
</li><li> Discussed again in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> issue of <em>Green Lantern Corps</em>, when Guy Gardner can't get a job as a high school football coach, largely because simply having him on school grounds on a regular basis would send the school's liability insurance rates through the roof. In the same issue, it's played with a bit again in John's scene, where he tries to convince the company that hired him to design a new building to incorporate expensive measures to minimize damage if it happens to get caught in a supervillain attack or real knock-down-drag-out hero/villain fight. They disagree about whether the added expense is worth it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Miracleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Miracleman">Miracleman</a></em>, the title character tosses a car at the villainous Kid Miracleman in a futile attempt to stop him. Recalling the battle, Miracleman says that his defenders claim the car was empty. "I'm sorry, but that simply isn't true." Even worse, it wasn't a car. It was a school bus full of children.
</li><li> The "superhero kids" comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PS238" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PS238">PS238</a></em> tries to handle the social consequences of superpowers realistically, and has brought up the concept of the "Super Samaritan Laws," which were lobbied for and passed to give superheroes some legal protections from the occasionally destructive consequences of super fights, considering the fact that if they <em>didn't</em> intervene, worse damage would likely happen. It helps that, in the PS238 'verse, many supers have gone into private and public work that <em>doesn't</em> involve crimefighting, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> Clay Industries (founded by a metahuman super-intellect) is explicitly mentioned at one point to create 'instant-buildings' used to rapidly re-build urban areas damaged by superhero battles.
</li><li> The first incarnation of Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em> finished winning the hearts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">New York City</a> in their first issue by staying behind to repair the damage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalBattle">the Statue of Liberty</a> caused in one of their battles. It was specifically mentioned that everyone was so happy to see a new team of heroes, that the metalworkers unions weren't going to sue their pants off for doing union work. Citizen V even alludes to the fact that superheroes cleaning up after themselves is usually <em>not</em> appreciated by those who would otherwise be paid to do it. Definitely a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshading">Lampshading</a> for this trope.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> had a storyline that began as something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>. First, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">their financial wizard disapparated with all their money</a>, then New York "thoughtfully" let them off the bill for all the damage that's been inflicted to New York during their battles <em>on the condition they handed over their HQ</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a></em>:
<ul><li> There was a comic in which She-Hulk decided the Thing needed some stress relief, so she took him out to a bar for a few drinks and started a fight with him. However, the city block destroyed in the process was scheduled for demolition (and she knew it). In fact, the workers hired to demolish that city block spent most of the comic sitting on the bar roof cheering &mdash; their contract said they got a hefty bonus if demolition was completed early, it didn't say the workers had to be the ones doing the demolishing.
</li><li> In another story, She-Hulk works as a volunteer for Green Cross, an organization dedicated to cleaning up the damage caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> and other gamma-radiation cases. The Green Cross leader and founder later reveals that he was the one who dared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">Rick Jones</a> to sneak into the gamma-bomb testing area, so he feels responsible for the very creation of the Hulk.
</li><li> Similar, in the first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JMSSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JMSSpiderMan">JMS' Spider-Man</a></em>, Spidey <em>levels down</em> a building scheduled for demolition, to work out some anger issues, and the wrecking crew just call it a day.
</li></ul></li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a></em>, where one of the Hulk's massive rampages results in many deaths and millions of dollars in property damages &mdash; and Bruce Banner on trial for crimes against humanity.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> miniseries <em>The Oath</em>, after Night Nurse finishes operating on Dr. Strange after he is shot by an intruder, Strange jokes that he might still be covered under the Defenders' group health insurance plan. For reference, the Defenders were a somewhat mismatched superhero team-up that included the Silver Surfer, the Hulk, and Namor the Sub-Mariner.
</li><li> In the Luna brothers' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSword">The Sword</a></em>, the collateral damages of Dara Brighton's battles with Zakros and Demetrios are treated realistically: the public at large reacts as if the world is ending.
</li><li> Subverted in a barfight between Colossus of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> and the Juggernaut, where Cain actually pays for damages afterwards.
</li><li> Speaking of X-Men, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a></em> always advises the team to avoid collateral damage (ie, no throwing random cars at bad guys), or at least cut a check to affected parties afterwards, since a mere diversionary tactic could mean years of debt for a civilian.
</li><li> Also sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Rogue in an issue of Xtreme X-Men, where she comments that "the X-Men may cause more collateral property damage than God," but they don't kill innocents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>:
<ul><li> Periodically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a>. Characters will sometimes make passing references to the city's "great public works" program, usually in the wake of yet another superhero battle. The introduction to the "Local Heroes" TPB includes a newspaper clipping that mentions Honor Guard using alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> to repair damage after one of their fights.
</li><li> Likewise, the first issue of the Homage run, "Welcome to Astro City" shows that years of these events have actually caused much of the city's populace to bond together in an extremely intense way, to the point that few (if any) avoid pitching in for clean-up and rebuilding.
</li><li> Supersonic came out of retirement to bring down a robot in a clumsy manner of pure force, causing lots of collateral damage; he's angry because he wouldn't have done that in his prime, but he was indeed the only one available, no one was killed, and Astro City is great at coping with damage, so he can live with it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Mighty Magnor</em> hangs a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">Lampshade</a> on the trope. The two comic book writers who accidentally unleashed Magnor are on the hook for his ever-increasing property damages&#151;balanced only by the ever-increasing licensing fees offered by Hollywood agents.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker">Sleepwalker</a></em> comics when a city accountant is examining all the property Sleepwalker has bent and twisted with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">warp beams</a> and trying to determine how much money Sleepwalker's efforts are costing the city. Detective Cecilia Perez, head of the NYPD task force assigned to investigate Sleepwalker, justifies the trope when she points out that crime is down 70% in the areas Sleepwalker patrols, and notes that getting rid of him might cause more problems than it solves.
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Scrooge McDuck</a> story "The Cowboy Captain of Cutty Sark". While selling bulls to the sultan of Djokja during his cattle days, Scrooge is forced to retrieve said longhorns from thieves, and the resulting destruction, including 'a Scottish cowboy steaming into a port on a run-aground ship', is so costly that he's forced to give up every penny from his sale.
</li><li> Shortly before the death of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, the Shield pointed out how dangerous an uncontrolled Spider-Man was when a battle between him and Boomerang did almost one million dollars in damages, when Boomerang was just robbing a jewelry store for a few dozens of thousands of dollars.
</li><li> On parting ways with new Ultimate Spider-Man Miles Morales for the first time, main universe Spider-Man gives him advice on being Spidey, including to <em>not</em> stick around after battles to avoid clean up duty. While this may be surprising for two such responsible-minded characters, it should be noted that if asked both would feel obliged to help no matter what else is going on, and considering the general crap-tastic time constraints a Spider-Man usually has on the average day, they just simply don't have that kind of time to burn.
</li><li> Averted in Kirkman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a> several times. Fairly early in the series, a duel between Invincible and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExpy">Omni-Man</a> shatters entire skyscrapers, killing thousands &mdash; so even when Invincible manages a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>, he can never reveal his secret identity for fear of criminal charges or even assassination attempts against his family. The trope is averted several times later in the series as well. You'd think that a guy who publicly saved the Earth from annihilation multiple times would be forgiven when a moment's hesitation results in a city being vaporized... but that's not how humans think.
</li><li> Played straight in an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>, when Tony Stark and Sasha Hammer have an all-out brawl in the middle of a busy highway, destroying a few passing cars in the process. Made absolutely hilarious when Pepper shows up and smacks Sasha with one of the destroyed cars, saying the owner gave her permission to use what was left of his car to beat the crap out of Sasha.
</li><li> Consciously averted in Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialParody">Official Parody</a> book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NotBrandEchh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NotBrandEchh">Not Brand Echh</a>, in a story where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">the Thing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> fight for six pages before an angry inspector from <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicsCode">the Comics Code Authority</a> comes and chews them out, listing all the damage they have caused. Because the Hulk reverts to Bruce Banner just before the inspector shows up, the Thing ends up taking most of the blame, and gets stuck with the responsibility for repairing the damages.
</li><li> Used by Starscream as part of his plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersCombinerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersCombinerWars">The Transformers: Combiner Wars</a></em>. He secretly sent Menasor to attack the colony of Caminus, then sent his troops and Superion to "rescue" the colony (and having two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> sized robots fighting caused plenty of collateral damage) and offered aid in rebuilding as a way to manipulate them into swearing allegiance to him. Windblade said it was obvious what Starscream was trying to do, but the alternative was a slow death as the colony's Energon reserves gave out.
</li><li> A problem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentAvengers">All-New, All-Different Avengers</a></em> as Tony Stark, by this point, isn't the financial powerhouse he once was, thus the team has to go easy on smashing villains across town. Ms Marvel is <em>horrified</em> when Nova decides to smother a fire by bringing down the entire building, especially since it's on her turf.
</li><li> Often tackled in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered">Empowered</a></em>, as superhero fights cause a lot of collateral damage that is only made worse by how <em>reckless</em> many heroes are (on one occasion Major Havoc nearly <em>killed</em> the girl he came to rescue).
<ul><li> Most notable are two of Emp's three times using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">Car Fu</a>: the first time she (ineffectively) throws a car at a rampaging monster only to see the old man <em>owning</em> the car looking at the remains of the vehicle, and the other time, as she uses the various <em>parts</em> of some cars as scaringly effective weapons, we're treated to flashbacks of her time in college, where she mentions that if a superhero <em>has</em> to use as weapon the car of people who struggle to pay their bills the less they owe the owner is to make the most of their sacrifice. She also mentions that car insurance rates in superhuman-populates cities are <em>five times the national average</em> specifically because superheroes continue throwing them at their foes.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Q:</strong> It's the insurance damage waiver for your beautiful new car. Now, will you need collision coverage? <br><strong>James Bond:</strong> Yes. <br><strong>Q:</strong> <em>[stares at Bond]</em> Fire? <br><strong>James Bond:</strong> Probably. <br><strong>Q:</strong> Property destruction? <br><strong>James Bond:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungShui">Definitely.</a> <br><strong>Q:</strong> Personal Injury? <br><strong>James Bond:</strong> I hope not, but accidents do happen. <br><strong>Q:</strong> They frequently do with you. <br><strong>James Bond:</strong> <em>[signs the form]</em> Well, that takes care of the "normal" wear and tear. Is there any other protection I need? <br><strong>Q:</strong> Only from me, 007, unless you bring that car back in pristine order.
</div></li><li> This one is justifiable by context, as throughout the scene, Q is disguised as an Avis rental agent, going through the pretense of filling in the necessary paperwork involved in any car rental agreement. They are MI6 agents, after all.
</li><li> Bond seems to have it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em>, but his allies in the Russian underworld do not, even if he is involved. After Zukovsky's caviar factory is demolished by Elektra King's henchmen (who were trying to kill Bond), Zukovsky shouts, "The insurance company is never going to believe this!" Probably because the damage was done by a helicopter equipped with a tree-cutting buzzsaw.

We don't hear from the car's owner and he doesn't get called on it, but he did ask to borrow the car first.
</li><li> In the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFourRiseOfTheSilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFourRiseOfTheSilverSurfer">Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</a></em>, Sue is seen disputing a report from the cops about how many cars were destroyed on a recent mission.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock">Hancock</a></em> has its protagonist as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> superhero whose penchant for massive collateral damage gets him a lot of flak from the residents of LA in the beginning of the movie, to the point of nearly getting him an eight-year prison term. Later, he gets asked for help by the police, who grant him a bit more lenience for collateral damage to stop the crimes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan">Demolition Man</a></em>: The reason John Spartan (and thus the film) is actually called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistTitle">Demolition Man</a>" is specifically because he tends to destroy buildings on the job. Because of this the public was all too willing to believe that he's responsible for the deaths of the hostages that landed him a cryo-sentence.
<div class="indent"> <strong>News reporter:</strong> How can you justify destroying a $7,000,000 mini-mall to rescue a girl whose ransom is only $25,000?

</div><div class="indent"> <strong>John Spartan:</strong> Good answer.

Everyone is apparently okay with this to such an extent that they <em>rename the ravine after Marty</em>. Though there is a long tradition of naming or renaming landmarks after people who came to a sticky end there, like Donner Pass.
</li><li> Neo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixReloaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixReloaded">The Matrix Reloaded</a></em> destroys what looks like a good chunk of a city in his hurry to save Trinity, and before that they destroy a power plant causing a mass blackout, and before that cause numerous car accidents on a highway. And let's not forget the helicopter they smash into an office building back in the first movie. The property damage inside the virtual reality of the Matrix probably doesn't mean much, but people who get killed die for real. Of course, Neo is only the "hero" from his and his associates' point of view, while to the Matricians they are terrorists, and the justification they could provide for their destructive streaks is dubious at best, hence why they don't bother to provide it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a> during the 1960s-1970s falls under this trope due to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">becoming a good guy</a>.
<ul><li> This is hilariously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a> episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon">Godzilla vs. Megalon</a></em>:

</div></li></ul></li><li> The eponymous female lead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouBethCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILoveYouBethCooper">I Love You, Beth Cooper</a></em> commits dozens of crimes during the movie, including fleeing the scene of an accident she caused by reckless driving and intentionally ramming a stolen car through a house wall in front of dozens of witnesses. Through sheer luck she doesn't actually hurt anyone but there is no suggestion at the end of the film that she is going to face any consequences at all for the thousands of dollars worth of property damage she inflicted during the film. In the book version it is mentioned that she only just gets away with it thanks to Tracee's dad being a lawyer. <a class="urllink" href="http://nowyourethinkinglikealawyer.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-love-you-beth-cooper-final-exam.html">This blog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> suggests that the law might have made a legal defense difficult.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed">Speed</a></em> is also a nice example of this. The amount of destruction caused by keeping the bus at its required speed looks like it should cost the city at least 100 times what paying the ransom would have cost. The airplane at the end alone... Note that the bus is owned by the City of <em>Santa Monica</em>, but Jack Traven is a City of <em>Los Angeles</em> police officer, and the woman driving the bus has a suspended license and isn't even an employee of <em>either</em>. Interesting to see who would get sued.
</li><li> Played straight and averted in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></em> films. At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII">Ghostbusters II</a></em>, it's explained that the damage they caused at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">first film</a> got them sued by every local official in New York, but at the end of the film they're back to being heroes again.

The Joes are among the most responsible heroes in fiction, and cause almost no damage to public property. The problem is that <strike>Cobra MARS</strike> COBRA isn't &mdash; and guess who's still in the area when the dust settles? After the Joes save <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Paris, the French</span> beat them up, wreck their gear, and slap them with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">permanent travel ban</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">Eagleland</a> is nicer; after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ripcord saves D.C.</span> all they do is hold him overnight before sending him back to the Pit.

</li><li> Played pretty straight towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastFive">Fast Five</a></em>, downtown Rio De Janeiro was nearly leveled by that vault... Though they're already wanted criminals, and they just leave the country.
</li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em>. The US government is implied to cover any Cybertronian-related damage. Unfortunately, the Autobots cause a <em>lot</em> of collateral damage in their fights. To the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">the President</a> sends a government official to express his concern to Prime and his team. The third film also implies that civilians are not exactly happy with all the damage inflicted on their homes and businesses (poll results show that half the world would feel safer without the Autobots; they aren't exactly in the wrong here). Additionally, Sam's dad says the government will pay for the damages to their house (caused by Bumblebee shooting at some Allspark mutations). Sam's mom decides to exploit this by demanding a hot tub to be built in the backyard.

It's entirely possible that Tony might get sued (considering his is the only name known by the public of all the Avengers and he's the only one who can <em>afford</em> to pay for the damages). There's also the fact that the Stark Tower (and its ARC reactor) were used to open the portal.
<ul><li> The fact that this had repercussions like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Wilson Fisk skimming on Incident reconstruction</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Chitauri-based weapons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">flowing into New York</a> also complicates the mess.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em> shows that Tony did in fact get sued for the damage. A lot.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>, the Nova Corps gives the Guardians amnesty for all their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHeroTeam">many, many past crimes</a>.

</div></li><li> One of the viral videos for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em> shows that people are now calling for the Avengers to be held accountable for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Ultron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Ultron">Ultron</a>'s destruction of Sokovia.
</li><li> This is a major plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>. People are fed up with all the collateral damage the Avengers cause during their missions, so the governments of the world craft a series of laws called the Sokovia Accords to keep the heroes in line. Of course, the Avengers are criticized for the damage they caused to New York while fighting the Chitauri, but the fact that they were stopping an alien invasion that was trying to kill <em>everyone they encountered</em> (and that the Avengers prevented the World Security Council from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuking</a> the city) goes unmentioned. Likewise, General Ross conveniently fails to mention his own involvement in the Harlem incident during the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And the ensuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">Civil War</a> was due to Zemo wanting to avenge his family who died in Sokovia, framing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a> to ensure team-destroying in-fighting would happen.</span> However, this trope is averted when the big hero fight does happen: the Avengers duke it out in an airport tarmac far from civilians, and collateral damage is relatively light. In context, Cap's team are trying to reach a Quinjet to fly to Siberia, and Iron Man's team (not knowing the full story) come to stop them. From a writer standpoint, it's a <em>much</em> better option than having the heroes go at it in the middle of New York City.
<ul><li> Strangely, no one brought up that all the damage cause in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> was caused by the fact that the organization that previously oversaw The Avengers was launching a murder fleet as part of a world domination plan.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DejaVu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DejaVu">D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu</a></em> the protagonist, ATF agent Doug Carlin, drives half-blind down a busy freeway bridge to see the route their terrorist suspect took (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory">It's a Long Story</a>) causing multiple car wrecks by doing so, which probably result in severe injury and death. Except for helpfully saying "Send paramedics" nobody brings this up again, and he faces no legal consequences.
</li><li> The <em>Taken</em> trilogy:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken">Taken</a></em>: Brian Mills causes considerable property destruction while trying to save his daughter. He also kills numerous bad guys, including a few captured or unarmed ones in cold blood, and shoots an innocent woman just to get her husband to give him information.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken2">Taken 2</a>,</em> the hero (and his daughter) cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior">considerable amount of destruction</a> in battling the vengeful surviving members of the human trafficking ring from the first film. Some of it includes police or government property. Hell, some of it <em>includes an officer.</em> (He <em>was</em> in league with the bad guys, but still.) You'd expect the number of crimes they commit would mean they'd be in prison until the next ice age, but we end with no talk of legal trouble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken3">Taken 3</a></em>, Mills again causes considerable property damage. He also escapes from police custody, breaks into a building, and abducts a motorist on the road at gunpoint to get a ride into town.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">Man of Steel</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fights in Metropolis must have killed hundreds if not thousands of people and run up a repair bill in the billions (three guesses whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">is going to end up bankrolling that?</a>). Some time is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">to show how terrifying it would be</a> to be a civilian on the ground with buildings collapsing in every direction. However, it's still nothing compared to the total destruction of humanity.
</li><li> This extends to Smallville too. Its downtown is almost leveled by the fight there and includes an explosion at a gas station.
</li><li> Superman fights Zod and/or his warriors in Smallville and later Metropolis despite being outclassed, and so a lot of damage happens. His attempts at knocking or throwing them away are invariably countered, at one point reaching Earth's orbit. Most of the time he's smashed into buildings by their attacks but sometimes he does the same (granted, into apparently empty or unfinished ones). The damage is compounded by attempts by the US military to intervene. Superman later also willfully trashes a multi-million dollar spy drone that has been snooping on him to make a point to the military to get off his back.
</li><li> In fairness, most of the destruction is caused by Zod's forces or machines. Superman causes comparatively little damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> centers around this. Batman (and a lot of others) is pissed at Supes for destroying Metropolis. The U.S. government is even trying him for some of the destruction.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Jaegers</a> cause probably billions of dollars worth of collateral damage. However, considering that it's them vs. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">the apocalypse</a></em>, you can see why people tolerate them. And it's known that standard procedure is to intercept the Kaiju long before they make landfall. For several years, the Jaegers run a near flawless record. Fighting in and thus damaging cities is avoided and would only be a lot worse without the Jaegers, as a tactical nuclear strike is the only other effective anti-kaiju weapon.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNegotiator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNegotiator">The Negotiator</a></em>, Roman takes several innnocent people hostage during the incident as he fights to clear his name. The movie does not imply that he will ever face consequences for doing so. Even if you have been framed for murder, taking innocent people hostage is still a crime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a></em>: Stanley breaks out of a jail cell, assaults an officer, steals his gun, kidnaps another officer at gunpoint and steals his car, yet receives no punishment. Even worse, he committed the crime he was held for and there was good evidence of him doing so. The trope is justified because the mayor thinks Stanley is a hero who was framed by Dorian. Plus, many of those crimes Stanley committed weren't entirely his fault, and he <em>had</em> to escape from the cell to save Tina and stop Dorian.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mayor</strong>: <strong><em>Dorian Tyrell</em></strong> was "The Mask." I saw it with my own eyes.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Firewall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Firewall">Firewall</a></em>, Harrison Ford's character, in the course of trying to save his kidnapped family: (1) breaks into an apartment and arrives at a murder scene, (2) gets his hands on the murder weapon, clearly leaving prints, (3) takes a bank teller hostage at gunpoint, (4) breaks into his ex-secretary's apartment and apparently forces her to help him after firing her earlier, and (5) then hacks into the bad guys' account to erase their money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gone">Gone</a></em>: Jill isn't arrested for illegal possession of a gun or menacing on coming back, though the police had been looking for her because she'd done these over the entire day. Possibly justified as she'd shown they were wrong to disbelieve her, and charging her would make them look bad when this came out.
</li><li> It's hard to imagine Inspector Clouseau of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ThePinkPanther">The Pink Panther</a></em> fame being able to get insurance on his home, seeing how often he destroys it while roughhousing with his servant Cato. Given that he's just as destructive with everything he crosses paths with while on the job, purely by accident, one also has to worry about the insurance liabilities of the Paris police force. Dreyfus occasionally laments how much stuff his least favorite detective breaks, but never brings up who has to pay for the damages.

The most violent death that would happen to him officially would be a car accident.
</li><li> In the superhero novel <em>Just Cause</em>, this trope is parodied by playing it straight: the titular organization does in fact have insurance to cover damages caused by their battles, as do most other superhero organizations. The "most" part concerns protagonist Mustang Sally, as the previous group she was a part of trashed a science hall in the first few chapters in a failed attempt to get a supervillain.
</li><li> Similarly, if not as explicit as <em>Just Cause</em>, insurance is mentioned in the <em>Wearing the Cape</em> series, as are rules of engagement that EXPLICITLY say make every effort to avoid civilians in superhuman fights.

It is kinda hard to charge him for damages considering he can simply escape by jumping around through time and space. Not to mention changing his appearance every now and then. Easily explains his mixed reputation among those people who know about him, though. This is why the original Torchwood had him listed as an enemy in their charter. They were founded when Queen Victoria saw him in action; she knighted him for his heroism then banished him for his crimes (and for being too damn cheerful about the deadly werewolf attack).

</li><li> It's made clear at multiple points that Matt Murdock doesn't have hero insurance. In fact there are several points where he almost gets arrested when police roll up while he's in the middle of doing something as Daredevil. The only reason they don't haul him in is that he's able to talk them down into going after the more dangerous fish. And the friction between Foggy and Matt throughout the last few episodes of season 1 and most of season 2 is implied to be because he knows just what's at stake if Matt gets arrested or killed. Fisk even manages to exploit this in season 3 by having Dex impersonate Matt's alter ego.

Later he lies and claims she was in the middle of the street while he was speeding past pursuing bank robbers. He can't be prosecuted so long as it was part of his crime-fighting, and this is explicitly said to be like the quasi-immunity law enforcement officers have while performing their duties, so the idea appears to have been codified by law in the show's universe. It's said he could still be sued, but Hughie's father says it would be too hard to prove wrongdoing. Butcher points out people simply <em>want to</em> believe that Supes are the good guys and thus ignore the collateral damage and all the problems of their vigilantism, though superheroes are shown carefully covering up actual blatant crimes they commit.
</li><li> When you are also backed by a multi-billion corporation and its marketing <em>and</em> legal departments, it is very easy to make people remain silent with their complaints or by outright forcing them to never mention anything by signing an agreement outside of court. Those few that insist on still making a fuss over the damage, destruction, or manslaughter get simply buried under litigation Vought can easily afford for years. Butcher does a small bit of investigating of concurrent crimes at the time of Robin's death proves internally it was false (and help recruit Hughie to his mission) but the uphill legal battle would still be brutal, thus much of the first season revolves around getting proof that A-Train is actually an addict and under the influence at the time of Robins death.
</li><li> In the past Butcher and his team were semi-sponsored by the CIA, but after several bad incidents (an attempt at blackmailing Lamplighter to give them a link inside the Seven lead to him killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHandler">Mallory's</a> grandchildren) they were forced to be more of a freelance team and have a difficult time keeping together at the start of the series. Butcher still has numerous contacts because of that past association, though many bridges were also burned. The Boys do end up guilty of or accomplices in numerous murders, robberies, blackmail and trespassing, which forces them to go deep underground once Vought becomes more aware of their existence. They do rebuild their relationships as they uncover legitimate evidence, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leading to all charges against them being dropped at the end of the second season, with talk of them heading an official counter-supe team for the CIA</span>.

It seems X-COM doesn't pay for repairing its own buildings on the outside (although this might be justified, since the expensive stuff is underground, the above ground stuff is just a damage buffer). However, all the organizations have their own fund sources and reserves and it is very much possible to drain those, thus depleting their ability to replenish their weaponry etc. - which basically means that subsequent raids are worth less if you also do damage to the buildings.

In his introduction alone, we see him jump onto a remote-controlled van, break its autopilot, jump off to flirt with a beautiful bystander, and all but abandon the vehicle to terrorize the streets. He also completely fails to prevent the theft of the goods inside the van, due to flirting with a yet another woman. Hence the only thing he actually accomplishes is needlessly endangering bystanders. And everyone loves him for it anyway due to his manly charisma. Did we mention that <em>Dr. Horrible</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of super heroes vs. supervillains?
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a>. An early story features an English class which specifically mentions that insurance and damage laws have evolved to address superhero-supervillain battles. Also, one of the major purposes of the school is to teach enough self-control that the kids are <em>not</em> destroying everything in sight while fighting the villain. And finally, in a novel set over Thanksgiving of first term, the kids find out that a brutal battle years ago in New York City has led to the point that everyone at school has to have a Mutant Identification card filled out in a meeting with the Mutant Commission Office, or they can't return to the school.

It is openly stated that Superhero Insurance doesn't exist because it would be too damn expensive. Doesn't stop Edwin from selling <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(and by selling we mean threatening into submission)</span> it anyways.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrintonChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrintonChronicles">Trinton Chronicles</a></em>, the city isn't really too fond of the vigilantes (heroes) fighting each other in the city with out rules..after all, it's a whole world full of super-powered people... even they have rules against over-use!
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkywayMechanix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkywayMechanix">Skyway Mechanix</a></em> where the state super-hero tells a police officer to send a bill to the "World Hero Alliance - Hero Insurance Department" after the chaotic neutral protagonists destroy a motel and blow up a gas station.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em> after the bank robbery arc. When the Undersiders villain team robs the bank, Kid Win, part of the Wards hero team sent to stop them, pulls out an energy cannon that inflicted serious property damage - damage that inflicted costs that actually exceeded the amount of money that the Undersiders stole, and not counting other damages from the fighting. He is given a <em>severe</em> talking down by Director Piggot as a result of his misuse of the weapon and the costs of the damage he inflicted. However, issues of property damage are only brought up for "minor" villain confrontations. When Class S threats like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">the Endbringers</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Slaughterhouse Nine</a> show up, all issues regarding property damage go right out the window and <em>everything</em> gets thrown at the threat until it is destroyed or driven off.
<ul><li> It's further touched on in reconstruction form later in Worm and the sequel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward">Ward</a>: Hero Insurance is <em>literal</em> for most high-profile teams<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06n2v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note06n2v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06n2v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">similar to the liability insurance carried by real-world high-risk professions like crane operators</span>, and commercial and property insurance policies typically have some level of "Villain Insurance"-type coverage for when the mad tinker tests their new resonance canon on <em>your</em> storage shed. Mentions are made of collateral-damage-prone heroes having financial problems due to astronomical insurance rates, so most heroes quickly learn to use their powers in ways that minimize collateral damage. Major organizations like the PRC also typically have some sort of legal counsel dedicated to quietly settling lawsuits from people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutRescuesTheyDontLike">Complaining About Rescues They Don't Like</a> and determining how much of the damage to the antiques store the heroes are actually liable for.

He's fallen on hard times because he's getting little action and thus less sponsorship for him and his supporters. He can't help out in other regions, which have their own heroes, because he has an insurance contract for collateral damage only in his district. His manager is able to get them the money they need by liquidating this contract, but at the risk of making him then incapable of taking any action without taking on all the cost. He does I anyway but manages to get the money he needs from a previously failed crowdfunding effort due to all the goodwill he earned.

In a deadpan style, he says that he insures buildings in Townsville from damage... and that he is a veeeeeery busy man. Of course, it's best not to think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">how unlikely it is that any insurance company would agree to insure buildings in Townsville at all</a>.

Professor Utonium is actually arrested over this, and there is talk of the girls being incarcerated. Said movie also shows that Townsville pre-Powerpuffs is a horrifying dystopia of crime and violence where criminals run rampant and the police seemingly never leave their favorite store, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Donut Thing</a>. The Powerpuffs might cause a lot of property damage, but Townsville seems to think that the reduced crime rate is worth it.
</li><li> In still another episode, the Professor is horribly worried about the girls' getting injured, and so builds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> for them to use. They refuse to... until they come up against a bigger monster that even they can't handle. They win... but level virtually all of Townsville doing it.

When they say it was the Professor's, he decides he'll let them off as long as they promise <em>never to use it again</em>. They're only too happy to agree, as the thing was damn finicky to work with. The suit returns in a later episode after The Mayor unwittingly activated the autopilot, and it's just as destructive as before

<div class="indent"><strong>Mayor:</strong> Thank you, mysterious heroes! The value of the Gemerald you saved is slightly greater than the cost of the damage you caused to this museum: A net gain for our great city!

<ul><li> Subverted. Arthur's attempt to break through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGlassCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGlassCeiling">Sidekick Glass Ceiling</a> ends with a climactic battle with the Tick, in which a restaurant was partially trashed. The episode ends with the reunited heroes fixing the same restaurant, with the maitre d' profusely thanking them: "When most superheroes have their brawls, they just leave a mess."
</li><li> When The Tick went to Europe for a hero exchange program, he was prevented from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoofHopping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoofHopping">Roof Hopping</a> due to damaging historically important buildings.
</li><li> At one point, he's vetoed from starting a fight with a supervillain in the supervillain's evil... Apartment?... On the basis that the supervillain will lose his cleaning deposit if it gets messed up. They decide to go fight on the roof instead.
</li><li> Also subverted in Episode 3, a 70-foot tall dinosaur, whose DNA subverted a human is rampaging through town. A reporter catches another superhero on camera. "This is Sally Vacuum at the scene of the Dinosaur Neil crisis. As you can see, Neil is still growing. We have with us one of the city's superheroes, Der Fledermous." <br>"Thank you, Sally." <br>"Der Fledermous, can you tell us what the superhero community plans to do about this menace?" <br>He tales one look at the creature, chuckles, and says, "Good question, Sally.

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a> had its share of this as well:
<ul><li> Witness <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywo6F4xYTvA">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> battle between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and Darkseid, which is made all the funnier by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Supes</a> monologuing about how he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">usually has to hold back so nobody gets hurt</a>. Gee, I guess all those buildings he punches Darkseid through were conveniently evacuated moments before?
</li><li> Conversely, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2BvSqqmidM">fight between Superman and Captain Marvel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was conveniently set in an empty city (built by Lex Luthor as a publicity stunt for his presidential campaign and it was its opening night). Two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">Capes</a> tearing up Metropolis over an argument might have stretched the suspension of disbelief just a little too much. After the fight, Superman even offers to repay the cost of the damage from the Justice League coffers, looking at Batman as he says this.
</li><li> In the Superman-Darkseid fight, Metropolis actually <em>had</em> been evacuated. You can see people watching the Superman-Darkseid fight, but a lot of people don't leave a city that has been evacuated. Also, given the fact Darkseid had pretty much invaded Earth in full force at this point, well... if they're gonna get killed, might as well enjoy the superhuman slugfest beforehand.
</li><li> Also, see the fight against Solomon Grundy in <em>Wake The Dead</em>. Supes makes his appearance by punching Grundy through a line of cars, into the distance and into a gas line, and, while he chats with the League about strategy, there's a gigantic explosion far away in what is apparently a populated urban area. This just marks the fight getting more and more out of control and, of course, more collateral damage, almost all of the big things involving Superman.
</li><li> However, there is a subversion in "The Greatest Story Never Told". After the League's battle with Mordru leaves whatever city they're in utterly demolished by collateral damage, the League helps clean up. Booster Gold, who had been criticized by the others for being too arrogant of a hero to actually <em>be</em> a hero (and himself coming to believe this over the course of the episode) and being relegated to crowd control, leaves the scene with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardHeroReward">the woman he was helping during the episode</a>, saying that he only does crowd control.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> when Superman was supposed dead and Lobo showed up to fill the vacancy. Showing why he's not the best replacement for the <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a>, his strategy for defeating a baddie is by simply <em>piling cars</em> on top of him. When the rest of the League waves him off from adding another one once the villain surrenders, a dejected Lobo tosses it over his shoulder and <em>into a building</em>.
</li><li> Earlier in the Superman animated series, Bizarro tries to help save the city, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">except doing more harm then good</a>, such as "saving" a building being demolished by throwing the wrecking ball away (which almost landed on a wedding), "fixing" a draw bridge (that a tanker was about to pass under), and "saving" Lois Lane from the real Superman (by knocking over the Daily Planet globe).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanDoomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanDoomsday">Superman: Doomsday</a>,</em> Supes throws Doomsday through a building on more than one occasion, and eventually defeats him by taking him to orbit and slamming him into the ground in the middle of Metropolis hard enough to level the entire block. In real life, Supes would've racked up a higher death toll than all the villains in the movie put together with that move. And he may well have, as this being a direct-to-DVD release rather than a TV episode, people were being explicitly killed in the show... but he was "dead" at that point, and he <em>did</em> stop Doomsday, who had wiped out entire <em>worlds</em> on his own. To put this in perspective, Metropolis is essentially in the same place as New York City. In the comic arc that this was based on the Justice League engaged Doomsday in central Ohio, and would have been completely wiped out if Superman hadn't shown up when he did. The battle between the two stretched over a third of the country, and left more than a thousand dead in its wake. The government's position was that anything that could take that kind of punishment was a serious enough threat that even losing most of Metropolis would have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">justifiable price</a> for putting it down.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a>. When Optimus Prime crashes into a truck, he apologized and says he heard something called "insurance" will cover that.
</li><li> Inverted in one episode with Henry Masterson stealing yet another autobot body. Powell, the guy who sprung Masterson from jail and gave him a job, gave his employee what amounts to <em>Villain Insurance</em> by pointing out that the damage was done on his company property (it was the company's ship, and the company's goods that were damaged) and that hijacking an Autobot body was not a crime, as there <em>were</em> no laws concerning autobots, leaving Fanzone unable to arrest Masterson since the latter technically didn't commit any crimes.
</li><li> Also played with a little bit in the live-action movie. In most cartoons, the Transformers trot around human areas with little to no difficulty. The movie shows just how destructive having giant, heavy robots mill about your back yard would be, even if they were trying to be not just careful but stealthy.
</li><li> Played with further during one scene showing Optimus Prime running along a busy road; his feet chew giant holes in the tarmac, but he doesn't hit a single car.
</li><li> This never came up in the Generation One series because they mostly fought in desert areas and even the city locations didn't have too much collateral damage. But <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> tries to balance it out considering the Autobot heroes are occasionally seen helping to put the city back together after a battle. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> had a segment that mocked this trope, however.
</li><li> They also get called on it more than once, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> Bulkhead. It's not fear that makes public opinion towards them someone ambivalent&mdash;it's the fact that they keep breaking stuff.
</li><li> Averted in Generation One's third-season episode "The Burden Hardest to Bear" where Rodimus Prime is chewed out by Japanese politicians and business men over the damage caused in recent battles. This forms the basis for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThisJobAndShoveIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThisJobAndShoveIt">Take This Job and Shove It</a> moment.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> had this factor into public opinion about him, with one member of the public complaining that he stepped on her foot and a construction worker complaining he somehow knocked a building out from under him. Not bad, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">someone without any actual superpowers</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> played with this in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a> spoof 'Super Strong Warner Siblings'. Even activating their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> caused quite a bit of damage. Meshed with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of the episode, at least...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cyborg once used a <em>building</em> against Plasmus. Perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAbridgedSeries">The Abridged Series</a>' line that "This city already has its own destructive jerks - the Teen Titans!" was closer than you'd think.
</li><li> And how many cars has Raven telekinetically thrown at villains?
</li><li> Raven has Cyborg beat in "Birthmark", where pretty much the entire city, frozen in time mind you, becomes her weapons. She used <em>two buildings</em> to try to crush Slade, who had superpowers at the time and survived unscathed. It's hard to believe that those buildings, or even half the cars, were empty.
</li><li> They put several holes in several buildings and wreck a road chasing a jewellery thief.
</li></ul></li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Commander Feral's</a> main points when speaking out against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats">SWAT Kats</a> to the media is the amount of collateral damage they cause. The Mayor/Deputy Mayor accept that the big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a> will cause more damage with the huge mecha/giant spider/ultratank/whatever else if left unchecked. Because the Enforcers can't stop them using Feral's tactics to 'minimize damage'. Not that Feral cares. He's tried to have them arrested several times and tried to hold them accountable for city damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em>: In a radio interview, Larry-Boy complained about how he has a really high insurance deductible, even though most of the things he breaks while fighting crime are only worth about five dollars.
</li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em> with Catman. This is the main reason he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a>, aside from being completely insane.
</li><li> In the premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, the giant robot/giant monster battle creates a huge crater in the middle of the city. The heroes are dismayed by the destruction and resolve to fight future battles in remote, unpopulated areas (with limited success at keeping to that resolution). In the very next episode, we see that the city has already completed a long viaduct right through the middle of the crater and is starting to erect new buildings. A few episodes later, a drag race takes place in the construction zone, and we see that considerable progress has been made in the rebuilding. Now, just imagine if New York City had instantly begun building new roads and towers on Ground Zero after 9/11. And consider that the destruction zone here was much, much larger &mdash; and given that people actually do die in this cartoon, it's unlikely that entire sector of the city had been conveniently evacuated. One must conclude that the people of this city are remarkably unsentimental.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HongKongPhooey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HongKongPhooey">Hong Kong Phooey</a></em> isn't so destructive given he doesn't have superpowers, he's so popular everyone who directly suffers from a fair share of his destruction is <em>pleased</em> for this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>:
<ul><li> Korra catches a trio of gangster benders and she's arrested along with the thugs for causing far more damage than the thugs would have if left unchecked. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Chief Bei Fong</a> explicitly tells Korra that the fact that she's the Avatar means squat to her.
</li><li> Subverted. Tenzin steps up and offers to cover the damages as part of the agreement for Korra's bail. Another part of the agreement was that Korra would immediately be sent home, but Tenzin later changes his mind. Though not happy with the decision, Chief Bei Fong accepts it as long as Tenzin keeps an eye on Korra.
</li><li> Double Subverted later on. After Lin sees the danger the Equalists, she is more or less lenient about Korra's way of handling things.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Mane 6</a> have caused a surprising amount of damage to poor old Ponyville. Their reasons for wanton destruction are usually caused for decidedly unheroic and mundane reasons (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic">Well, mundane within the show's context at least</a>) and include a flubbed spell to drive out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">parasprites</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Pinkie Pie</a> finding a <em>cloning pool</em>, and Twilight afraid of being late for a homework assignment. However, since they're the heroes, not once are they called on it.
</li><li> Poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Derpy</a>, on the other hand, gets some serious scorn heaped onto her by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Rainbow Dash</a>, for whom causing severe damage to buildings is part of the daily routine, after she inadvertently trashes City Hall. Hilariously though, it's <em>Applejack</em> who ends up going out to earn the cash to fix it.
</li><li> The Season 7 episode "Daring Done?" examined this trope, as it deals with Daring Do dealing with the fallout for leaving destruction across Equestria when trying to save the day. However, the royalties from her book sales mean she is rich enough to pay for the damages&mdash;she just gets so distracted stopping the bad guys that she forgets to clean up after.
</li></ul></li><li> Nick Logan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoswellConspiracies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoswellConspiracies">Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends</a></em> causes a lot of damage while pursuing/running from aliens. Since he's part of a secret organization they have a team dedicated to keeping it all under wraps, either by suppressing knowledge or arranging for someone else to take the blame.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em> Spider-Man engages the Sandman who's robbing an oil tanker in the city harbor, even though there was literally no conceivable way for Spidey to defeat a colossus made of sand. In the ensuing fight Sandman accidentally sets the ship on fire and casualties are only prevented because he comes to his senses and saves the crewmen, and then sacrifices himself to protect people from the explosion. Spider-Man gives him an appreciative little speach and then leaves, oblivious to the fact that due to his pointless intervention both the oil <em>and the tanker</em> have been lost, and the oil spill and fire have probably spelled an ecological disaster for the city, not to mention all the hindrance from the wreckage. Somehow, nobody in the city holds it against him either. Maybe Jameson was on to something...
</li><li> Gumball and Darwin, and to a lesser extent, the rest of the Wattersons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> cause all kinds of collateral damage in many episodes yet are rarely punished for it. Subverted and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in "The Finale" when the consequences of their actions throughout the series come all at once.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em>, this is one of the titular heroine's powers; she and her partner Cat Noir are basically free to do as much damage as they want in their battles against akuma because her magic powers can fix everything afterwards. Some plans do involve purposely wrecking their surroundings to defeat their opponents, up to and including slicing the Eiffel Tower in half. This power explicitly even restores anybody who's <em>killed</em> in the battle, since on one occasion they fought an akuma with the power to erase anybody it touches from existence. Without Ladybug's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldHealingWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldHealingWave">World-Healing Wave</a>, the supporting cast would've gotten a lot smaller afterward. This is probably also why there's no apparent stigma against people who had previously been transformed into akumas.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, the Crystal Gems regularly are in the middle of destruction of Beach City. Most citizens complain, but quickly bounce back. Only Mr. Pizza got seriously angry at one point and asked for repairs. The Gems ignored him and Steven apologized for them which Mr. Pizza accepted. It's never mentioned how the town pays for all the repair costs. In the Gems' defense, one episode explains that the Gems had actually warned the citizens ancestors about settling there since they would be in danger. The humans settled anyway and most have grown up with the weirdness, only reacting confused or in panic when directly confronted by it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> are pretty destructive when saving lives and fighting villains. Vehicles are some of their most frequent victims: motorcycles explode, train/subway cars get their roofs torn off, and cars get flattened. Gargoyles will leave claw marks and holes on walls whenever they climb up a building, and chunks of rock burst away from them and litter the ground when they wake up from stone sleep each morning. The gargoyles get away from all the repair bills, because they're seen as nothing but urban myths.
</li><li> This is a constant problem for the Mayor of Mega City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtomicPuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AtomicPuppet">Atomic Puppet</a></em>. He's the one on hook for all the bills racked up by the battles between Atomic Puppet and their various foes after all, so he's determined to try find a reasonable way to replace Atomic Puppet, like getting the police force to step up their game or bringing in a less destructive superhero. This <em>was</em> averted in one episode though when Atomic Puppet was forced to pay for destroying an art museum and a wrestling stadium during two separate fights.
</li><li> A citizen of Goodhaven in Ralph Bakshi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Terrytoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a> series <em>The Mighty Heroes</em> lampshades this in the simplest of terms:
<div class="indent">With heroes like these, who needs villains?

The laws vary by region and jurisdiction, providing more or less protection based on the version of the law.
</li><li> Collateral damage and friendly fire during wartime is often a problem. In spite of improving technology, war inevitably results in civilian casualties, including civilians that one side is trying to protect from the other.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, US military in Germany had personnel specifically tasked with paying civilians for damages it caused during maneuvers off bases who usually accompanied the troops.

</li><li> Retired lawyer Bob Ingersoll, who reviews comics for legal accuracy with his "Law Is A Ass" column, has stated that in many cases superheroes would legally be covered by the "emergency doctrine", and thus couldn't get prosecuted or sued when they cause property damages when trying to save lives.
