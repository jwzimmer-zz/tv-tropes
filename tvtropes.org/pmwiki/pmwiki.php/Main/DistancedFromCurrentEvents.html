<p>A kind of self-censorship born out of sensitivity to current issues. One frequent situation is when a new episode (or possibly an old one) is edited or not broadcast because it coincides with some recent tragic event. Can be taken to ridiculous extremes, especially if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> is involved; for example, after President Reagan was shot, <em>The Greatest American Hero</em> had the name of its main character changed because his name was Hinkley, the same as the would-be assassin. Sometimes it goes so far that any fictional depiction of someone or something upon which tragedy has been visited cannot be shown at all for fear of "trivialization" - even if the depiction is respectful.

Some older shows and even movies had broadcasts digitally edited to remove it from the skyline. This sometimes happened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">even when the show or movie was set before 2001.</a> This has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, in that it allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">the terrorists</a> to destroy the World Trade Center <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">retroactively</a></em>.

<ul><li> In 1994, the restaurant chain Jack in the Box released the first commercials with the "Jack" character. In the commercials, he referenced the 1980 commercials where they blew up the jack-in-the-box head that was their trademark, saying they had "fired" him. He then claimed that due to plastic surgery, he was back and would change Jack in the Box. Immediately after this announcement, the commercial showed Jack getting revenge by blowing up the building's boardroom behind him. The commercial drew <a class="urllink" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-12-28-fi-13834-story.html">criticism<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for appearing at a time when several real-life bombings were in the news.
<ul><li> The referenced "Jack Blows Up" commercial from 1980 declared that "The Food is Better At The Box!", which turned into this trope when Jack in the Box had an <em>E. coli outbreak, perhaps the biggest outbreak of the bacteria ever.</em> The outbreak came from the Monster Burger promotion which ran under the tagline, "So Good, It's Scary!"
</li></ul></li><li> A TV ad for the 1986 Ford Aerostar minivan, which compared the van's profile to that of the Space Shuttle, was pulled after the <em>Challenger</em> disaster.
</li><li> Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, did a Weight Watchers commercial in which she said she got most of her exercise running from the paparazzi. It was released the same week as the death of Princess Diana of Wales and was immediately pulled.
</li><li> Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a popular weight-loss-by-meal-replacement programme in Great Britain was frequently advertised on the TV as <em>AYDS Helps You Lose a Lot of Weight - Fast!</em> Following a certain new disease which came to the public eye in the 1980s, however, AYDS, its advertising and the product itself vanished completely.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jms2zOU2MZE">A commercial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vigilante8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vigilante8">Vigilante 8</a></em> featuring a heavily damaged school bus was supposedly pulled after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> massacre.
</li><li> When WE tv began airing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/McLeodsDaughters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/McLeodsDaughters">McLeod's Daughters</a></em>, they ran a humorous promo where a mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> her family with duct tape so they wouldn't interrupt her while she was watching the show. The ad was pulled in response to a news story about a child who had died after having their mouth taped.
</li><li> Walmart pulled a commercial featuring a Black father saying "I can't breathe!" after the grand jury failed to indict NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the choking death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. In particular, the issue was that "I can't breathe" were the last words Garner said while dying on-camera, and subsequently became the rallying cry of those seeking to end race-based police brutality. (It is still available on t-shirts, jackets, hats, etc., and his daughter famously wore one in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FReJcgTIoB4">a promo for the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.)
</li><li> HP and Hardee's ads were <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tv-pulls-shuttle-sensitive-material">pulled<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in light of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
<ul><li> The HP was harsher than the others because it <em>bragged about bringing astronauts to safety.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/EnergizerBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/EnergizerBunny">Energizer</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oSgAcT_g2w">"Bombshell Bunny"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> commercial only aired a few times before being pulled after the Oklahoma City bombing.
</li><li> In 2017, the automaker Dodge sponsored a drag racing event in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigan</a> called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.roadkill.com/events/roadkill-nights-powered-by-dodge-returns-to-woodward-avenue-for-a-second-year/">Roadkill Nights<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with their new Challenger SRT Demon muscle car featured there. The event was held on August 12... which was, unfortunately, also the day when a neo-Nazi at a "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">drove a Dodge Challenger into a crowd of counter-protesters</a>, killing one and injuring nineteen others. Dodge very quickly <a class="urllink" href="https://jalopnik.com/dodge-deletes-roadkill-nights-posts-after-charlottesvil-1797895666">removed the banner and tweets<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> page promoting Roadkill Nights (the former complete with a picture of the Demon), though not before they got hit with no shortage of jokes and remarks about the unfortunate timing.
</li><li> Kraft Heinz suspended Planters' Super Bowl LIV ad campaign, which centered around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> of their longtime mascot Mr. Peanut, in the wake of Kobe Bryant's tragic death. Both the incident and the first ad in question involved vehicles crashing, with the Planters ad involving a car crash and Kobe dying in a helicopter crash, and the campaign would've continued in the week of Kobe's death with new material leading up to Mr. Peanut's funeral, which was to air during the game itself. Despite the cancellation, the ad slated for the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which ended with Mr. Peanut being reborn as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinoffBabies">Baby Nut</a></span>, aired as scheduled.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nUjs81VEvI">KFC once ran an ad<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> featuring their Tiananmen Square location until it was pulled in the wake of the 1989 massacre.
<ul><li> In 2020, KFC announced they would drop their slogan, "It's finger-licking good," in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and people becoming more cautious about spreading germs.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X/1999</a></em>, which has been suspended at 18 out of a planned 21 volumes since 2003, has been forced to distance itself from current events repeatedly. The series is intentionally violent and disturbing, but uncomfortable resemblances to real-life tragedies have caused repeated suspensions in publication. In particular, beheadings depicted in the story became controversial after the gruesome <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakakibara_Seito">Sakakibara Incident<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and the recurring theme of earthquakes as a sign of the end of the world after the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanshin_earthquake">Kobe Earthquake<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The current publication hiatus does not seem to have a single trigger but may be due to the general post-9/11 climate towards terrorism (which is essentially what the antagonists are engaging in). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a> has stated in interviews that they did not believe that they would be able to get the planned ending published <em>at the time</em> and that they have not abandoned <em>X</em>. Fans have mixed opinions about the likelihood of the series restarting publication.
</li><li> The second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em>'s first episode had Kaname getting abducted by a female gang leader, with Sosuke responding by kidnapping said leader's little brother<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0s47t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0s47t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0s47t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though it's revealed that it wasn't a <em>real</em> kidnapping, the brother was a willing accomplice and Sosuke paid him off with an RC car</span>; it was cut from broadcast due to a high profile kidnapping case at around the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em>:
<ul><li> The third episode of the 2004 anime adaptation was left unaired, as it was to deal with an earthquake, and a real one had just struck Niigata Prefecture. This leaves a minor plothole because that episode is the one that introduces their pet dog.
</li><li> The 28th episode of the same adaptation was delayed two months due to the Amagasaki derailment that occured a month prior because it was about shikansen bullet trains going too fast, causing problems at a hospital near the station they originated from. That episode would become the 34th in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> and the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em> had to be delayed for a week in Japan because the contents of it were eerily similar to a murder case in Tokyo, where one girl killed her father with a cleaver which was <em>identical</em> to the kind that Rena has. This eventually led to <em>Higurashi Kai</em> and <em>School Days</em> being dropped from several channels' prime time line up and Higurashi's opening song being reworked to change the scene of Rena's cleaver to that of the junkyard where she goes to. In terms of <em>School Days</em>' changes, see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/09/21/japan-axe-murder-school-days-and-a-nice-boat/">this link<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The long-awaited Chinese Federation story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em> was delayed a week, presumably due to the earthquake that struck central China in early May 2008.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> anime, the tornadoes that Placido/Primo creates in his Duel against Yusei are completely absent from the dubbed version of one episode. This was done due to the tornado disasters in the Midwest that occurred during this time period.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, the character of South Korea had to be pulled out of the webcast due to protests by Korean groups. This might also explain why Tibet, featured as a part of the East Asian group in one of the strips, was replaced by a panda when said strip was animated.
<ul><li> Also likely the reason there is no canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoePersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoePersonification">North Korea</a>. The author also avoids mentioning the Holocaust if at all possible to keep up the series' lighthearted tone (and because Germany's one of the main characters). The English dub, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">isn't afraid to sneak in a few jabs about it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway remain a very bad subject to be insensitive about in Japan. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, for instance, being in production at that time, was more or less re-planned on the fly to avoid being offensive in a manner that it was not intended to be offensive.
</li><li> The release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/IsThisAZombie">Is This a Zombie?</a></em> was pushed back a week for "violent content" due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em>:
<ul><li> After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars">Pretty Cure All Stars</a></em> movie was edited in its initial theatrical release to remove a tsunami scene that was subsequently restored for its DVD release.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gsqa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1gsqa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gsqa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The scene in question was a flood of fairies pouring into the mall the heroines were in, sweeping them away, ending with Hibiki floating on top and crying out "What is going on?!"</span>
</li><li> This trope was the reason why The Melody of Sorrow was completed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure">Suite Pretty Cure &#9834;</a></em>. The creators wanted the kids to relate to the horrific events on that day by having their beloved heroines suffer through a similar event. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the show still had a happy ending where the characters defeat Noise and the Melody of Happiness is sung.</span> In addition, a scene in episode 6 of <em>Suite</em> had the glittering effect added to cake mix that Hibiki's brother, Souta, was trapped in to make it look less like a fluid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure">Smile Pretty Cure!</a></em> was made as a response to the earthquake disaster, with the series having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> tone than most installments of the franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> got postponed for over a month as a destroyed and flooded city featured prominently in its final episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Coppelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Coppelion">Coppelion</a></em>, had both the original manga and its anime adaptation put on hold because its plot was initiated by a nuclear reactor exploding due to an earthquake destroying its cooling system and rendering Tokyo almost uninhabitable for more than 20 years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> episodes were being re-aired during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, so two climactic and destructive episodes were skipped in favor of the more lighthearted episodes that immediately succeeded them.
</li><li> One manga case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> involved a relatively large earthquake striking while the Detective Boys were playing in an abandoned building, which led to a kidnapping victim in the building waking up and trying to alert the kids to their situation. The anime adaptation of that case cut all mentions of earthquakes due to the then-recent 2011 earthquake, and instead had the kidnapping victim simply hear the kids in the building and try to get help.
</li><li> Sports pedophilia incidents such as the Jerry Sandusky scandal have led fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">Basketball</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel">Light Novel</a> <em>Ro-Kyu-Bu!</em> to accuse its production committee of this trope for banning the series from home video release outside of Japan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Battle of the Shaking Island! Barboach VS Whiscash!!</em> has never aired anywhere: an episode about Barboach creating earthquakes was never shown on Japanese TV because of a strong earthquake a few days before it was set to air. Judging from the episode list on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> it seems as though they're trying to forget the episode even existed. The anime also retired the moves of Earthquake, Fissure and Magnitude after the episode was pulled.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Electric Soldier Porygon</a> gave children seizures, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TVTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TVTokyo">TV Tokyo</a> pulled any programming related to Pok&eacute;mon from its' lineup and VHS rental chains pulled tapes of the anime off their shelves. Like the Earthquake move above, in the anime the eponymous Pok&eacute;mon has never appeared in a major role since and its evolutions have only made extremely rare and brief appearances as stock artwork when the show's forced to show all the Pok&eacute;mon existing at the time (Porygon2 was shown in the Johto Pok&eacute;rap, and both Porygon2 and Porygon-Z were glimpsed in the intro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonKyuremVSTheSwordOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonKyuremVSTheSwordOfJustice">Pok&eacute;mon: Kyurem vs. The Sword of Justice</a></em>, which featured stock art of all the Pok&eacute;mon up to Meloetta).
</li><li> The appearance of Jynx (a controversial Pok&eacute;mon which had earlier caused a couple of episodes to get pulled due to being perceived as a blackface stereotype) in a three-episode <em>Advanced Generation</em> arc set to be broadcast in America during Black History Month in 2006 caused the entire arc to be pushed back to May of that same year. As the arc was a very important one, it couldn't be skipped, unlike Jynx's other appearances. Jynx, even with the recolor, hasn&#146;t been seen since the 2005-2006 Battle Frontier arc.
</li><li> A DVD release of the first three movies took place in the United States in Spring 2009&mdash;just after Noriko Sakai was convicted of drug possession. Needless to say, the set, which included <em>Pikachu and Pichu</em> (which was taken out of circulation in Japan on Sakai's account), was soon pulled, and the international distributor ultimately lost the rights for good in part as a result of the set's failed release.
</li><li> One episode in the XY series, "An Undersea Place to Call Home!", was held back due to the sinking of a ferry off the South Korean coast. The episode depicts a luxury liner that has been submerged for some time. It would finally be aired months later after an initial airing in Korea. The initial Japanese and US airings were skipped and replaced with Ash's gym battle with Grant; with the episode airing in Japan not long after South Korea and later aired in the English Dub in early 2015.
</li><li> When the US TV network Kid's WB! did re-airings of Season 1 in 2001, the episode "Tentacool &amp; Tentacruel" was taken out of the rotation. This was due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks because in that particular episode Tentacruel destroys several skyscrapers. Despite this, one shot of said Tentacruel smashing the skyscraper remained in the first season intro.
</li><li> While the reason was not officially confirmed, many believed the episode "Tower of Terror" in 2001 was skipped because of the name and its association with the attack on the World Trade Center in New York. The Orange Islands episode "A Scare In The Air" was also renamed to "Spirits In The Sky" around the same time for the same reason. Both "Tower of Terror" and "Tentacool &amp; Tentacruel" re-entered rerun rotation and "Spirits In The Sky" got its' original title back in 2006 when the series' rights went to Cartoon Network.
</li><li> After Harvey Weinstein sent a long line of dominoes falling with his sex scandal, the movies distributed by his Miramax Films were not aired as part of Disney XD's January 2018 <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> movie marathon. Twitch is also excluding the films from its Pok&eacute;mon marathon that same fall.
</li><li> Due to growing racial tensions in America, an episode where Lillie helps Ash disguise as a Passimian<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2nhy1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2nhy1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2nhy1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A lemur-like Pok&eacute;mon with a black muzzle; Ash coloring his face black coupled with the history of black people being compared to monkeys led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> for American audiences</span> was skipped in 2018&mdash;the first time in 16 years, it so happens, this happened to any episode. To put it in perspective, the last episode to go unaired outside of Japan fell afoul of the same political correctness standards regarding blackface with a major appearance by Jynx.
</li></ul></li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate">Auditiongate</a> (<a class="urllink" href="http://pastebin.com/Pu2hADMc">it's a long story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), all DVDs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BluRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BluRay">Blu-ray</a> discs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KokoroConnect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KokoroConnect">Kokoro Connect</a></em> were delayed for a month in the aftermath. It's also the reason why a new opening theme was recorded for this initial home video release; one member of the band who wrote the original OP hinted at the scandal's existence via Twitter and thus unintentionally provoked the Internet into counterattacking the producers, so he decided to take a hiatus from the group as a direct result of the fallout.
</li><li> On the day before the fourth episode of the new-edit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> anime was to be televised, a 16-year-old girl murdered her 15-year-old classmate in her apartment in Sasebo by dismembering and decapitating her. The episode's broadcasts were initially cancelled soon after, due to very similar violent content in said episode.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3k6vc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3k6vc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3k6vc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The episode in question revolved around a deranged schoolgirl who was kidnapping and dismembering her female schoolmates in order to make works of art out of their body parts.</span>
</li><li> Similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> example on the 9/11 page, the premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmAuroraDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmAuroraDream">Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream</a></em> was held back a week due to the March 11th disaster.
<ul><li> Five years later, the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PriPara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PriPara">PriPara</a></em>, suffered from this trope in Korea, when episode 36 was supposed to play on the day of the Brussels attacks. After the incident happened, the episode was pulled from broadcast due to the episode's plot involving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Laala trying to revive Falulu after she dies</span>, and they skipped to episode 37. However, the episode did show up on a Korean online TV service.
</li></ul></li><li> Digital Manga Publishing dropped their release of the <em>controversial</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">Cure Your Gays</a> manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheBeautifulSkiesOfHououHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheBeautifulSkiesOfHououHigh">The Beautiful Skies of Houou High</a></em> mostly due to the rising amount of LGBT bullying and suicides around the time they released it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Thriller Bark arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleMan">Invisible Man</a> Absalom stabs Sanji repeatedly with a knife as Sanji is protecting Nami, which bites him in the ass when he gives his location away by stepping into a pool of blood. However, when the anime reached that part, a massacre involving a knife had occurred in Japan, so the scene was altered to make Absalom relentlessly beat Sanji instead, and give his location away by stepping too close to him. The scene was restored to normal in the DVD versions when it wasn't an issue anymore.
</li><li> The anime ran into this problem again later on during the Dressrosa arc. One of Kyros's first acts upon being restored to his human form was to decapitate Doflamingo, only for him to turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">Actually a Doombot</a>. While the decapitation itself aired without incident, only a few days later ISIS executed two Japanese hostages in a similar manner (see below), so that in following episodes a swirl of yarn was hastily slapped atop the headless puppet, and frames showing the head on the ground were zoomed in and/or cropped to avoid showing the severed neck.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueCometSPTLayzner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueCometSPTLayzner">Blue Comet SPT Layzner</a></em> was cancelled was how the second part of the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> had Earth conquered and oppressed by a tyrannical and virulently racist Empire... whose actions were <em>very</em> similar to how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japan</a> had treated its colonies <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule">and ESPECIALLY the Korean Peninsula<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> a few decades ago.</span> Technically speaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> had been doing it for years with Zeon, but the difference is that <em>Gundam</em> was at least a <em>little</em> more subtle about it whereas <em>Layzner</em> took the theme and dealt with it much more directly.
</li><li> Thanks to ISIS taking and murdering Japanese hostages, the last weeks of January 2015 have been pretty bad weeks for violent anime, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>. Even the comparatively light-hearted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TanteiOperaMilkyHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TanteiOperaMilkyHolmes">Tantei Opera Milky Holmes</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-01-30/5th-milky-holmes-td-episode-delayed-due-to-circumstances/.83875">didn't escape the fallout.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

ZEXAL</a></em>, Shark wields a card called "Poseidon Wave", which visually creates a tsunami to stop enemy attacks. Thanks to the 2011 tsunami, they were forced to change the card's name to "Zeus Breath" and change the tsunami to a wall of wind.
</li><li> The "Martial Figure Skating" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma &frac12;</a></em>, which included a girl who stole things and "kidnapped" people/animals out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity">Cuteness Proximity</a>, was delayed because of several kidnappings which had taken place in Japan around the time the three episodes were set for broadcast. They would only be shown months later after the series had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">Un-Cancelled</a> and an episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">depicting flashbacks to said episodes</a> had been broadcast as part of the initial run.
</li><li> Following the crash of the Space Shuttle Columbia and the deaths of all onboard, Cartoon Network pulled the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> episode <em>Wild Horses</em>, which heavily featured the Columbia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FireForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FireForce">Fire Force</a></em> had the broadcast of Episode 3 <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-19/fire-force-anime-halts-friday-planned-airing-streaming-of-3rd-episode/.149134">halted<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> after the arson attack at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a> due to the series' premise about firefighting, and this specific episode being about an arsonist trying to burn down a building and kill the people inside. The episode aired the following week in an edited format, with changes such as changing the color of the flames and reducing the impact of the narration.
</li><li> In 1998, a woman at a Wakayama summer festival put arsenic in a pot of curry being served there, killing two adults, a 10-year-old and a 16-year-old when they ate it and poisoining 63 others. This lead to scenes featuring characters eating curry being cut from episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNishimura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNishimura">Super Radical Gag Family</a></em> and <em>Takoyaki Mantoman</em> that premiered at the same time.

Instead, the next episode was rerun, with opening narration for episode 31 edited into it.
</li><li> Two different anime were impacted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusPandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusPandemic">Coronavirus Pandemic</a>:
<ul><li> The anime adaption of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/A3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/A3">A3</a></em>, which already had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> from the start, had an episode delayed <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/A3Wiki/status/1227947370069024768">because it had an unknown scene considered to be too similar to the pandemic.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

The <em>Challenger</em> disaster occurred while the miniseries was in production, and the vessel Superman saves was changed to an "experimental space-plane".
</li><li> The cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Preacher">Preacher</a></em> #52 was originally supposed to depict an 8-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Tulip O'Hare</a> getting a handgun as a Christmas present.

As with the above example, the issue had been in the works for several months, the timing was merely coincidental. The issue was eventually released as a standalone story in 2010.
</li><li> Issue #3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Batman Incorporated</a></em> was pushed back a month due to the tragic shooting spree that occurred at a Colorado screening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>.

</li><li> On her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a> blog, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a> mentioned that she had to rewrite an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2011">Batgirl</a></em> (which featured a Latino youth being brutalized by bigoted security officers) due to some similarities it bore to the death of Trayvon Martin.
</li><li> <em>Trinity</em> was originally scheduled to have a three-issue arc called "Divided We Fall," which would have dealt with Batman, Superman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> defending a racist hate speaker from angry rioters. The issues were cancelled by DC due to the increasingly volatile political situation in the United States following the election of Donald Trump, including at least one incident that bore superficial similarities to the riot in the story.

Luckily, unlike the "National Stupid Day" Garfield comic, nobody noticed this because the comic changed 30 minutes after said earthquake happened because the earthquake happened at 11:30PMEST, 30 minutes before both the Garfield and U.S. Acres comics changed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em>
<ul><li> The release of the movie was delayed several weeks due to the Kennedy assassination.
</li><li> One of Slim Pickens' <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/quotes?qt0454447">lines<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was also re-dubbed: "Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff."
</li><li> It originally ended with a pie fight in the War Room, and at one point the President is hit, prompting the line "Our gallant President has been struck down in his prime!".
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the censors nixed a gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse">Animal House</a></em> (released in 1978) that would have had a sculpture of JFK on a parade float being shot in the "head" during the chaos when the Deltas attack the parade in their "Eat Me" float. (In the finished film, it is <em>Jackie</em> Kennedy who is disrespected, when Babs Jansen, who is portraying Jackie, has her pink suit ripped off and ends up in her underwear.) Ironically, in-universe the gag would have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"Funny Aneurysm" Moment</a>, since the parade takes place in the autumn of 1962 - more than a year before the assassination.
</li><li> A showing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard2">Die Hard 2</a></em> was delayed in the UK and instead replaced with the showing of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a></em>. The reason for this was because there had been a recent incident at Glasgow Airport involving a flaming car crashing into the building, and with the movie being set in an airport they probably thought showing it would be in bad taste.
</li><li> The release of <em>Fly Away Home</em>, about a thirteen-year-old girl leading a flock of Canada geese to their nesting site by flying a hang-glider, was delayed for several months following the death of seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff in an attempt to become the youngest person to fly across the United States.
</li><li> The release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceCamp">SpaceCamp</a></em>, originally scheduled for early 1986, was pushed back several months following the <em>Challenger</em> disaster.
</li><li> The release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneBabyGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneBabyGone">Gone Baby Gone</a></em> was delayed in the UK because there were parallels to the recent disappearance of Madeline McCann.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoneBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoneBooth">Phone Booth</a></em>, the Colin Farell movie with his character stuck in a phone booth at the mercy of a sniper (voiced by Keifer Sutherland), was originally supposed to be released in October 2002. In light of the D.C. Sniper attacks, it was moved to April 2003.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoondockSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoondockSaints">The Boondock Saints</a></em> was also set to be released in theatres the same <em>week</em> as the Columbine shootings, and ended up having an extremely limited release (five theatres in the country, for one week). The film would've been doomed by the coincidence then and there had people not started talking about it to their friends and pen pals and brought about high sales of the DVD, causing it to become a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> and leading to a sequel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/O" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/O">"O"</a></em> was delayed after the Columbine shootings, since the film featured gun violence among high school students. It was postponed from its April 1999 release date and wasn't released until summer 2001.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeachingMrsTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeachingMrsTingle">Teaching Mrs. Tingle</a></em>, about high schoolers getting revenge on their teacher, was retitled from "Killing Mrs. Tingle" because of Columbine.
</li><li> Advertisements for the 1991 B horror film <em>Body Parts</em>, in which the protagonist whose arm is severed in an accident receives a limb transplant from a dead serial killer, were pulled in Wisconsin because the promotion and release of the film coincided with the discovery of the Jeffrey Dahmer killings.
</li><li> Trailers for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDilemma">The Dilemma</a></em> were pulled due to Vince Vaughn's character describing hybrid cars as gay ("but not in a homosexual way") <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-anderson-cooper-gay-joke,0,5367496.story">after a rash of gay teen suicides.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesCraven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesCraven">Wes Craven</a>'s original vision for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984">A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)</a></em> was to make his villain Freddy Krueger a child molester and rapist as well as a child killer, but had to excise this little detail because he wanted to avoid being accused of exploiting a series of highly-publicized child molestations that was happening in California at the time the movie was being made. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet2010">The 2010 remake</a>, though, restores said detail.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> pulled the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>-directed film <em>Hereafter</em> from Japanese theaters after the Sendai earthquake and tsunami, as the film's opening sequence contains a harrowing tsunami disaster.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowersInternationalManOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowersInternationalManOfMystery">Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery</a></em>, No. 2 informs Dr. Evil that his plan to end the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales has been overtaken by real-life events - an exchange cut from the British release, thanks to another far more tragic real-life event involving the Princess of Wales which happened the week before.
</li><li> The Norwegian theatrical release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeNeedToTalkAboutKevin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WeNeedToTalkAboutKevin">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></em> (a movie about a mother dealing with the fact that her son had massacred the kids at his school) was postponed from autumn 2011 to 2012 due to the recent Utoya massacre. This massacre is also the probable reason why it saw little distribution and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwardSnub">got snubbed at the Oscars</a>
</li><li> The James Bulger murder, which killed any chance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mikey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mikey">Mikey</a></em> ever being released in Britain for the foreseeable future (that, and the fact that it isn't really a film worth fighting for), also delayed a re-release of at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoNasties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoNasties">Video Nasty</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellOfTheLivingDead">Zombie Creeping Flesh</a></em>, for the next several years; the BBFC told the distributors that now would not be the best time to submit the film for rating. It wasn't until 2002 that the BBFC decided to accept a submission of the film, and the distributors' patience was duly rewarded: the film was rated 18 uncut. Interestingly, the video release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> was held up until 1995 for the same reason.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> was advised shortly after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoNasties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoNasties">Video Nasty</a> crisis that it would be too soon to attempt a home video re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em> (which was always legal to exhibit in theatres, mind you), which ultimately didn't return to shelves until 1999.
</li><li> The Enzian Theater, an independent Central Florida-based movie theater, was planning on doing a special screening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> for Father's Day in 2016, but following the events of the Pulse nightclub shooting, it was pulled and replaced with a screening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em>.
</li><li> This is the reason why then-regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucioFulci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucioFulci">Lucio Fulci</a> collaborator Dardano Sacchetti is uncredited for his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zombi2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zombi2">Zombi 2</a></em>. Specifically, his father had died before the film premiered, and he didn't wish at the time to be associated with a film where the dead come back to life only to be killed a second time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenStiller">Ben Stiller</a> movie <em>Neighborhood Watch</em>, about suburban dads who form a neighborhood watch and end up fighting aliens, had its marketing pulled from movie theaters in the wake of the fatal shooting of 17-year-old <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin">Trayvon Martin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by a neighborhood watch man in Sanford, Florida. The film was subsequently renamed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWatch">The Watch</a></em>, with the marketing revamped to focus more on the alien aspect than the neighborhood watch.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WalterHill">Walter Hill</a> film <em>Trespass</em> was originally titled <em>Looters</em> and was scheduled for release in summer 1992. After the L.A. Riots, the film was pushed back to December and had its title changed to avoid negative connotations.
</li><li> The red-carpet premieres of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> in France, Mexico, and Japan were cancelled in the wake of the horrific shooting on the film's North American opening day (July 20, 2012) when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreeKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreeKiller">Spree Killer</a> stormed a midnight showing in Aurora, Colorado. Twelve people were killed and seventy more were injured, and to make matters worse, the gunman called himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> after he was arrested. Ads touting the movie have also reportedly been pulled, and Warner Bros. opted to give final box office updates for the film on Monday, rather than through the weekend, out of respect for the victims of the Aurora shooting.
</li><li> Speaking of the Aurora shooting, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsterSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsterSquad">Gangster Squad</a></em> was hit badly by this. Not only was it pushed back from September 2012 to January 2013, but the entire ending had to be rewritten and reshot due to its depiction of gangsters shooting up a movie theater. The trailer, which included scenes from that shootout (and which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">played in front of</a> <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> at many theaters), had to be pulled and redone for the same reason. Only time will tell if the offending sequence will be included on a future home video release.
</li><li> Apparently, in the city of Aurora, Colorado, the wounds were still raw seven years later, because the theater where the shooting happened opted <a class="urllink" href="https://news.avclub.com/the-theater-targeted-in-the-2012-aurora-mass-shooting-w-1838413952">not to show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em> for this reason. It didn't help that the film was already intensely controversial before its release, due to concerns about its portrayal of the Joker as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">beaten-down loner</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">snaps and turns to crime and terrorism</a>, which many felt was evocative of any number of then-recent mass shootings, Aurora included.
</li><li> As a result of the Columbine shooting, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream3">Scream 3</a></em> was delayed several months, and toned down for violence.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightAtTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightAtTheOpera">A Night at the Opera</a></em> was re-released during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, several lines mentioning Italy were deleted from almost all surviving prints, leaving them unheard for several decades until a print with the offending material intact was discovered in Hungary in 2008.
</li><li> The film <em>I Love You, Daddy</em>, written, directed by, and starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisCK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisCK">Louis C.K.</a>, was originally set for a limited release on November 17, 2017, having attracted plenty of award-season buzz after being filmed in secret over the summer. However, it was pulled indefinitely by its distributor just a week before it came out after CK confessed to several instances of sexual harassment, which was very similar to the movie's plot of a Hollywood producer trying to stop his teenage daughter from dating a 70-year-old film director (who was heavily based on Woody Allen).

The studio's explanation was that it was to take advantage of the lucrative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllHallowsEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AllHallowsEve">Halloween</a> market for horror films, but director Kimberly Peirce <a class="urllink" href="http://www.out.com/entertainment/movies/2013/01/07/kimberly-peirce-carrie-adaptation-terrorists">contends<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the real reason was the Sandy Hook shooting making it uncomfortable to release a film with <em>Carrie</em>'s subject matter (a bullied high school student murdering her classmates at the prom) just three months afterwards.

It was even featured in the film's trailer. Unfortunately, however, less than five months before the film was released, the space shuttle <em>Challenger</em> exploded 73 seconds after launch, resulting in the deaths of all seven aboard, including New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.

It doesn't help that the film had already garnered controversy over its plot (liberal "elites" versus conservative "deplorables") by both sides of the political spectrum.

<ul><li> In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting in December 2012, radio stations across the US refused to play several songs that were deemed insensitive due to their lyrics despite the fact that they were big hits at the time, including <em>Die Young</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha">Kesha</a> ("let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young"), <em>Titanium</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidGuetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidGuetta">David Guetta</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia">Sia</a> ("you shoot me down, but I won't fall, I am Titanium") and <em>Pumped Up Kicks</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FosterThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FosterThePeople">Foster the People</a> ("all the other kids with your pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullets"). This last one was specially seen as problematic as (despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a>) it talks about gun violence and mental health in young people.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a>'s album <em>Impossible Princess</em>, released in 1997, was retitled <em>Kylie Minogue</em> in the UK following the death of Princess Di.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> album <em>Paranoid</em> was originally going to be called <em>War Pigs</em>, but was retitled due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>. Of course, the war was already going on, and "War Pigs" (the song) was probably <em>about</em> the Vietnam War on some level. The retitle was intended to make the album marketable, and the song stayed on. Still, the cover depicting a soldier remained. Also, the album tour was considered to be in bad taste by many because it happened right on the heels of the Charles Manson murders - despite Charles Manson and Black Sabbath having absolutely nothing to do with each other, except for both being "dark."
</li><li> "Teenage Dirtbag" by Wheatus contains the line "Her boyfriend's a dick; he brings a gun to school". However, the single was released around the time of the Columbine Massacre, and so the clean version had "gun" bleeped out along with "dick". Of course, if you hear the clean version on the radio or somewhere these days it can be a source of confusion.
</li><li> The last verse to "I Get a Kick Out of You" was originally: "I get no kick in a plane / I shouldn't care for those nights in the air / That the fair Mrs. Lindbergh goes through." Following the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, however, Cole Porter changed it to the familiar "I get no kick in a plane / Flying too high with some gal in the sky / Is my idea of nothing to do."

</li><li> In December of 2004, a major tsunami hit most of Indonesia and other islands. Radio stations in Germany removed "Die Flut" (The Flood) by Witt/Heppner, "Land unter" (high floods) by Herbert Gr&ouml;nemeyer and, most (in)famously "Die perfekte Welle" (The Perfect Wave) by Juli from regular schedules.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s "Sulk" was originally going to have the line "just shoot your gun, you'll never change" as part of the refrain, and early live performances included this lyric. By the time it was recorded for <em>The Bends</em> in late 1994, "Just shoot your gun" became "Just like your dad", due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a>'s then-recent suicide by gun. The song was actually inspired by a different tragedy, but one that would have been less fresh in listeners' minds at the time: A lone gunman's killing spree in Hungerford, England that had occurred in 1987.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Europe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Europe">Europe</a>'s signature single "The Final Countdown" was released in their home country just two weeks after the Challenger accident, which set its American release back three months.
</li><li> Billy Joe Royal's single "Burned Like a Rocket" was climbing up the country music charts when the Challenger disaster occurred. As a result, radio stations withdrew the single from their playlists, ending the song's chart run.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre">Jean-Michel Jarre</a>'s mega-concert <em>Rendez-vous Houston</em> was scheduled to take place in Houston, Texas on May 5th, 1986 to celebrate Houston's and Texas' 150th anniversary and NASA's 25th anniversary. Of course, the planning phase of such a huge event started in 1985 already. The show was to also feature Jarre's newest album, <em>Rendez-vous</em>, to be released in early 1986. Both on the album and at the show itself via live video link, the astronaut Ron McNair was planned to play a piece specifically written by Jarre for him on his saxophone aboard <em>Challenger</em>. After the shuttle exploded, Jarre wanted to cancel the entire concert, but NASA and McNair's friends and relatives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShowMustGoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShowMustGoOn">convinced him to carry on</a> and also make the concert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam">a memorial for the victims of the disaster</a>. The already heartfelt "Ron's Piece", the saxophone played by Kirk Whalum at the concert where it was the last number but one, became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">even moreso</a> by leading it in with Ronald Reagan's eulogy for McNair projected on a skyscraper and the piece itself being accompanied by photo and video footage of Ron McNair as several-hundred-feet-high projections. To lift the spirits up again, Jarre continued with a projection of Kennedy's "We choose to go to the moon" speech and concluded the concert with the happy "Fourth Rendez-vous" which he even had to repeat as an encore. By the way, the Texans didn't mind Jarre going ahead with the concert so soon after the disaster: He broke his own audience world record with more than 1.5 million live spectators.
</li><li> After the February 1, 2003, Columbia space shuttle disaster, some radio stations briefly stopped playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkWills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkWills">Mark Wills</a>' "19 Somethin'", which contained the line "The space shuttle fell out of the sky" (in reference to the 1986 Challenger disaster). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">However, this was only a momentary dip at best</a>, as the song still spent a monstrous <em>seven</em> weeks at #1.

It was originally titled "Turkish Airways Give You So Much More," referencing a then-recent plane crash. (Eno was fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">Gallows Humor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> at the time.) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">record company</a> made him change it, though they somehow found a song about burning airlines acceptable.
</li><li> Following Ray Rice's removal from the Baltimore Ravens for domestic abuse, a Rihanna performance that was slated to kick off the 2014 NFL season was scrapped (CBS feared having a domestic abuse victim perform at the NFL opener in the midst of the ongoing NFL domestic abuse scandal would put Rice's crimes at the forefront). Needless to say, Rihanna was not amused.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IU">IU</a> was going to put a cover of a song by Kim Kwang-seok in her album <em>A Flower Bookmark 2</em>, but due to a conspiracy theory about the circumstances of Kim's death surfacing around the time of release, she removed that track from the album. The albums that were distributed to stores had to be pulled just before they went on sale. She eventually uploaded the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXmoJu81e6A">music video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on Youtube in 2018.

</li><li> The album <em>Recover</em> by Great White got an unauthorized reissue by an Italian record label in 2004. This alone wasn't good news for the band, but they might not have objected so strongly if the label hadn't renamed it <em>Burning House of Love</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">very sensitive title</a> given that the year before, a fire had broken out at a Great White concert and killed 100 people. Right away, the band urged fans not to buy this version; the label did later rename it <em>Love Removal Machine</em>, though the band's still not happy that it was illegally re-released at all.
<ul><li> That wasn't the only illegally released Great White compilation with insensitive content that came out that year either, there was another compilation that combined "Recover" and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> covers album "Great Zeppelin" called "A Double Dose". The original release featured a burning shark on the cover art, resulting in backlash from the band and fans alike and forcing the cover to be changed to a more innocuous shot of a shark emerging from the water.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Busted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Busted">Busted</a> changed the title of what would become their first UK Number 1 single from <em>Crash and Burn</em> to <em>You Said No</em> after the Columbia disaster in 2003, deeming that the title would be "inappropriate" as a result. The track's title on the album would retain the original title until its reissue later in 2003.
</li><li> An accidental case happened with the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a> album, given back then reviewers and fans just thought everything a former Nirvana member would do just had to do with Kurt Cobain killing himself. Thus <em>Billboard</em> said the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun">Ray Gun</a> on the cover was "<a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zAsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA56">tasteless<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" even if it was just another sci-fi element like the band name, and others criticized the line "one shot, nothing" in "Weenie Beenie", when Dave Grohl wrote the song the same year he joined Nirvana.
</li><li> Doug Supernaw's 1995 single "What'll You Do About Me" was subject to this. The song, originally written in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> theme that likely played more innocently at the time... but in the wake of the O. J. Simpson controversy, some felt that it was too sympathetic toward the stalker. The label tried to appease this by editing the lyric "<em>I'm on the porch with a two-by-two</em>" to "<em>I'm on the porch with dinner for two</em>", but this still wasn't enough: some stations still refused to play the song, and one in Terre Haute, Indiana banned the song after a local woman was murdered by a stalker. The pushback became so severe that the song plummeted off the charts and his label dropped him.
</li><li> In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the title of Powfu &amp; beebadoobee's "death bed" was changed to "death bed (coffee for your head)", with some radio DJs only referring to it as "Coffee For Your Head". Some radio stations also played an edit which changed the lyrics referring to death.
</li><li> In the wake of the George Floyd protests, not one but <em>two</em> country music bands had to change their names to remove references to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">Antebellum Southern United States</a>. Lady Antebellum changed their names to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyA">Lady A</a> and The Dixie Chicks changed theirs to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheChicks">The Chicks</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a> released a song for Halloween 2011 entitled Marty Beller Mask, which heavily references <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a> and her work, and it became a staple at live shows...for a few months, until the February 2012 death of Houston. Out of respect, the band retired the song from live performance, and it has never been played publicly since.

<ul><li> WWE stumbled into such a moment during the airing of a live broadcast. On the day it was discovered that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> and his family were dead, WWE replaced a scheduled three-hour <em>RAW</em> episode with a tribute to Benoit's career. During the airing of the tribute, it became clear that the deaths were a murder-suicide, <em>as the show was airing</em>. WWE just has rotten luck when it comes to tragedies &mdash; so much so that they instantly turned a 180 &mdash; not only did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> apologize for the tribute show, but ever since, Benoit has never been mentioned by name on any new WWE programming that has aired since his death, his name is almost completely wiped from their website (save for some minor mentions in title histories and whatnot), and footage containing Benoit in which he was a major part of has not been seen on WWE programming. Hooray for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waving</a>. Classic Benoit footage is available on the WWE Network (with a "does not reflect the views of the WWE or the personal lives of the wrestlers" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings">content warning</a>), several passing mentions of Benoit have come up on recent DVD releases, and &mdash; starting with Shawn Michaels a few months after Benoit's death &mdash; several WWE wrestlers have used the Benoit's signature submission hold, the Crippler Crossface (including the man who tapped to it at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 20 &mdash; Triple H &mdash; and, on the same night, Trips busted it out for the first time, so did The Great Khali.) What makes this even worse? The <em>Raw</em> that was replaced was intended to be one of the major turning points in the "Who killed Mr. McMahon?" angle. A few weeks prior to Benoit's death, Vince had been (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>) blown up after stepping into a limo, and the three-hour <em>Raw</em> was intended to reveal who the perpetrator was. Following the Benoit murder-suicide, the angle was dropped completely, with Vince reappearing on <em>Raw</em> a month later to explain that he'd faked the explosion in an attempt to see what people really thought of him.
</li><li> Late in its run, the braintrust at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> decided to repackage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">goofy German dancer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexWright">Alex Wright</a> into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">Goth-like</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel">Foreign Wrestling Heel</a> Berlyn. Trouble was, Berlyn debuted shortly around the time of Columbine, and his attire (specifically, his ring jacket), apparently drew too many comparisons to the killers. WCW was then forced to drop the character after a handful of appearances, and Wright went back to being himself and partnered with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GlennGilbertti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GlennGilbertti">Disco Inferno</a> as the Boogie Knights.
</li><li> On an episode of RAW in 2012, wrestling manager A.W. said "Titus O'Neil is like Kobe Bryant in a hotel room: <em>unstoppable!</em>" That was a reference to Bryant's rape charges, which had happened a few years earlier. With WWE trying to paint themselves as a family-friendly program, and with Linda McMahon running for Senate, WWE fired A.W. for the reference.
</li><li> In 2014, Rusev and his manager, Lana (actually, American born Catherine Perry) began a Foreign Heel gimmick where they were Russian sympathizers while degrading America at every opportunity, all to draw heat. The "Russian who hates America" gimmick dated to the height of the Cold War, but the WWE, Rusev and Lana took this a step farther when, at the 2014 Battleground pay-per-view event, Lana delivered a heel promo prior to Rusev's "United States vs. Russia" match with Jack Swagger blaming the United States for "recent current" world events and praising Russian president Vladimir Putin. Some in the media viewed the promo as a veiled reference to the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 three days earlier.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note57m56');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note57m56" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note57m56');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A reported 283 people died in the airliner shootdown, near Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.</span>The WWE was forced into damage control, making a statement to TMZ.com and various professional wrestling websites that Lana's scripted promo "was in no way referring to the Malaysia Airlines tragedy," but both the mainstream media and professional wrestling journalists strongly disagreed, with at least one writer saying that a reasonably intelligent viewer could conclude that Lana's promo was making reference to the plane crash.

(or any jokes about the gators and crocodiles) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/JungleCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/JungleCruise">Jungle Cruise</a></em> attraction anymore.
</li><li> The incident also caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">Louis</a> to be written out of the <em>Mickey's Royal Friendship Faire</em> show, which debuted just three days later.
</li><li> Additionally, the Tick-Tock float in the <em>Festival of Fantasy</em> parade and the crocodile animatronics in <em>Living with the Land</em> were both temporarily removed in direct response to the incident.
</li><li> Press junkets for the re-opening of Epcot's popular attraction <em>Soarin</em>' as well as the park's new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a> Ever After</em> ride were also cancelled, due to both this and the Orlando nightclub shooting that had occurred just <em>days</em> before the alligator attack leaving no one in a particularly celebratory mood. None of this stopped the latter ride from being a huge hit from the get-go.
</li><li> As mentioned above under Live-Action TV, most of the media coverage Disney planned for the opening of Shanghai Disneyland Resort in China ended up postponed thanks to these incidents, although the grand opening ceremony special aired on The Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior as scheduled.
</li><li> In the <em>Disney Junior Live On Stage!</em> show's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JakeAndTheNeverlandPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JakeAndTheNeverlandPirates">Jake And The Neverland Pirates</a></em> segment, the audience had to make alligator noises to scare Captain Hook. After the incident, the audience now claps to scare him.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to ongoing racial tensions in the United States, the retheming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/SplashMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/SplashMountain">Splash Mountain</a></em> into a ride based off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em> was pushed up the announcement table.
</li></ul></li><li> At <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios">Universal Studios</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/MenInBlackAlienAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/MenInBlackAlienAttack">Men in Black: Alien Attack</a></em> was originally going to feature the "Tiffany" cutout from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">first movie</a> in the attraction's opening training scene for riders to shoot at; but after the Columbine massacre had occurred, it was decided that this would be in extremely poor taste.
</li><li> When Universal Studios Florida was in its early planning stages back in 1982, concepts were drawn up for an elaborate nighttime lagoon show that would've featured an explosive finale where a plane would crash right into the water. This idea wound up being abandoned following the devastating helicopter incident that occurred during production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></em>.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/FastAndFuriousSupercharged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/FastAndFuriousSupercharged">Fast &amp; Furious: Supercharged</a></em> opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, Agent Novak's dialogue towards Roman Pierce was more aggressive, with Novak telling Roman to "get down on the ground" while holding him at gunpoint. Novak's dialogue was later softened to have him just say "Don't move" to Roman, in response to the many police brutality controversies occurring around the nation at the time.
</li><li> In response to the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, Universal postponed its initial grand opening date and press junket for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/SkullIslandReignOfKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/SkullIslandReignOfKong">Skull Island: Reign of Kong</a></em> attraction until July 13th.
</li><li> The nightclub shooting also led to Universal delaying the release of any new announcements they had concerning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HalloweenHorrorNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HalloweenHorrorNights">Halloween Horror Nights</a> until the next month, as well as cancelling plans for a scarezone based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurgeElectionYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurgeElectionYear">The Purge: Election Year</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TwisterRideItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TwisterRideItOut">Twister...Ride it Out</a></em> was slated to open in March 1998, but ended up being pushed back several months out of respect, because in the February of that same year there had been an outbreak of tornadoes in Central Florida that claimed 42 lives and injured 260 others, the deadliest outbreak in Florida history.
</li><li> During construction of Universal Studios Japan, Universal opted to duplicate the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Backdraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Backdraft">Backdraft</a></em> attraction instead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/EarthquakeTheBigOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/EarthquakeTheBigOne">Earthquake: The Big One</a></em>, as they feared that Japanese audiences would be uncomfortable with the attraction, considering how Japan has been home to many devastating earthquakes.
</li><li> For the versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Terminator23DBattleAcrossTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Terminator23DBattleAcrossTime">Terminator 2 3-D: Battle Across Time</a></em> that were at the Florida and Hollywood parks, Sarah Connor would show the audience various clips from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2</a></em> movie in the pre-show, one of those clips being Sarah's nightmare of the nuclear destruction of Los Angeles. When the show was brought over to Universal Studios Japan, the Los Angeles clips were omitted, so as to not remind Japanese guests of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</li><li> The 2002 theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HalloweenHorrorNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HalloweenHorrorNights">Halloween Horror Nights</a> was initially going to revolve around an evil undead girl known as "Cindy", but it was scrapped due to there being a string of child murders in the area at the time. The event's theme for that year was changed to revolve around "The Caretaker", who was Cindy's father in the original backstory.

<ul><li> Although it was first of a two-part video game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a>: Innocent Sin</em> was not translated into English despite Atlus' interest in localizing the title. Ostensibly, this was due to the game's storyline involving Nazis and the resurrection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, as well as fighting the main character's high school principal and a teacher in the game committing suicide in a school's belltower. The aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">No Swastikas</a> issue was actually used as cover for a far more serious reason, though; <em>Innocent Sin</em> may have been translated had it not been at the time of the Columbine High School Massacre (it should be noted that the main characters of <em>Innocent Sin</em> are <em>high school students</em>, and one of the game's gimmicks involves equipping them with guns. Even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> managed to make it stateside, any references to Nazis were removed, and Hitler was disguised with sunglasses and a trench coat, and referred to as "The Fuhrer" (though the censorship occurs in the Japanese release as well due to a rule change at CERO.)
</li><li> The NES game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a></em> involved Nazis resurrecting Hitler, but the US release was edited to change the group to the Badds and the resurrectee to Master D. The animations were not changed, though, and he still had the signature moustache (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">his head still explodes</a> when you kill him at the end).
</li><li> The Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has part of a quest removed where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo">you can nuke an entire town</a>; specifically, the NPC Mr. Burke. Without him, you can't set off the nuke. Also, the Fat Man (named after the bomb dropped on Nagasaki) was renamed to Nuka-Launcher. However, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, the upgrade kit for the Fat Man that halves its weight is called "Little Boy" (the Hiroshima bomb). That made it to the Japanese version unchanged.
</li><li> Future information on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novel</a> <em>Root Double: Before Crime * After Days</em> (about a group of people trapped in a nuclear reactor after it goes through a meltdown) was postponed for nearly five months due to the 2011 Sendai Earthquake in Japan, which led to the partial meltdown of several nuclear reactors.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZettaiZetsumeiToshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZettaiZetsumeiToshi">Zettai Zetsumei Toshi</a></em> series (which is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> series in which the "horror" is a collapsing Japanese city) was effectively dead for 5 years because of the Sendai tsunami and earthquake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MotorStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MotorStorm">Motor Storm</a>: Apocalypse</em> (which features racing through an earthquake-ravaged city) was delayed due to the 2011 Japanese earthquake.
</li><li> In-universe example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>: The present ruler of Solitude cancels the annual festival where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">hated tyrant</a> is burned in effigy. Her husband, the High King was just murdered, so a festival celebrating the death of a king, even a tyrant, is probably less than appropriate. Interestingly, the modified version of the effigy burning (which is part of the Bard's College entry quest) can be seen as <em>supporting</em> the old High King, by painting the hated tyrant as a <em>false</em> king who came to power by force and treachery, just as Ulfric Stormcloak (the murderer of the previous High King) plans to become.
</li><li> An example that actually <em>did</em> occur in the Pok&eacute;mon games; specifically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">first generation</a> remakes. In the original, published in 1996, one of the exhibits in the Pewter City museum was the Space Shuttle <em>Columbia</em>. In the <em>international</em> remakes, published in 2004, it was a nameless spacecraft. The <em>Columbia</em> burned up in reentry in <em>2003</em>. It is notable that the shuttle kept its name in the Japanese version of those remakes.
</li><li> A March 2020 Psychic Pok&eacute;mon event in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pok&eacute;mon GO</a></em> which had previously hyped the introduction of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Gothita and Solosis,</a> suddenly appeared to <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/JoeMerrick/status/1243244161324797952">drop mentions of Solosis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in later promotional material for the event, while still hyping up Gothita. Solosis was still obtainable in the event, but the reduced mentions of the Cell Pok&eacute;mon were likely due to the unfortunate coronavirus connotations. Any material that referenced going outside had to be tweaked (including their <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Shankha_Deep17/status/1243732901683814400">Twitter bio<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), Raid and Safari Zone events were postponed and cancelled, and many game mechanics were altered to make it easier for players to play inside, such as selling boxes of Incense and Poke Balls at dirt-cheap prices. The Abra Community Day event was also postponed for the same reason to April 25, with the event being significantly retooled to make it easier to play from home.
</li><li> The NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Super Contra</a></em> was retitled <em>Super C</em> to avoid connotations with the Iran-Contra scandal that was going on at the time.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> was first conceived, the plot was going to involve Solid Snake and Liquid Snake fighting in the Middle East, and Liquid revealing that he had actually faked his death in MGS1. This concept was scrapped once the Middle East conflict began in real life. However, they did keep the Middle East idea for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em>, where the first act of the game takes place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Qurac">vaguely Middle-Eastern country of some variety</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a> launched with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead">House of the Dead</a> 2</em>, and an official Sega-made light gun controller was set for release along with it. But the Columbine school shootings prevented the official gun from being released, while third-party companies got away with releasing theirs.
</li><li> The US release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilGunSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilGunSurvivor">Resident Evil: Gun Survivor</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">had its lightgun support removed entirely</a> due to Columbine.
</li><li> Weeks before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</a></em> was released in Japan, a murder was committed in Japan in which the murderer left only the head and feet of the victim. Because of this, a death animation that involved Crash being pressed down to merely a head and feet had to be cut from the Japanese release, in fear that the Japanese would find it tasteless due to said real-life murder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a> X3</em>, one of the Encore Extra Stages was "Tohoku EVOLVED" (now available for standard play), a song made in tribute to the victims of the 2012 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. If you tried to invoke this trope by getting a AA on your Extra Stage with the Wave modifier turned on, <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/0C56VxYfprI">the game prevents you from playing "Tohoku EVOLVED"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The 1988 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BBCMicro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BBCMicro">BBC Micro</a> game <em>Pipeline</em> was originally set on an oil platform, but after the Piper Alpha explosion, the setting was changed to a sulphur mine in outer space.
</li><li> During the 1.0 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, Titan (an earth-based godly being) and Leviathan (water godly being) were going to be released into the game with an update, but when the tsunami-earthquake disaster struck Japan in 2011, Square-Enix withheld the two boss characters since they felt launching characters who can cause earthquakes and tidal waves would be too close to home for its Japanese players. The two characters were eventually patched into the game a few years later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a></em> features a type of zombie that spawns other zombies as backup dancers as it boogies toward your brains. Its original design was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s appearance in Thriller, but was changed to a stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco">disco</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">dancer</a> after his death.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Opening Message:</strong> Any resemblance to persons living or undead is purely coincidental.
</div></li><li> Transfer Pak support for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> was nerfed severely following the Columbine shooting in 1999. The game was originally intended to hook up with the Game Boy Camera to create characters with real-life faces, but Nintendo nixed that, their rare willingness to authorize the release of a violent M-rated video game from a second-party company notwithstanding, because in light of the backlash against violent video games that followed they realized a feature like that in a game that was already violent enough for an M rating as it was would come across as tasteless at best. Strangely, it took years until anyone related to the game's development was willing to just <em>say</em> that was the reason - before then, they claimed "technical limitations".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bonk">Bonk</a>: Brink of Extinction</em> was going to be the <em>Bonk</em> series' return as a downloadable title for the PS3, 360 and Wii, the plot of which involved Bonk attempting to save the world from an incoming meteor. It ended up cancelled in March of 2011 in part because of the Fukushima disaster.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathRoadToCanada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathRoadToCanada">Death Road to Canada</a></em> was delayed out of respect for the victims of the terrorist attack in Toronto, Canada on April 23rd, 2018, which was only a few days before the game's scheduled release date.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GetEven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GetEven">Get Even</a></em>, a game set in the United Kingdom, was originally going to be released on May 26, 2017, but it was pushed back a month following the Manchester Arena bombing.
</li><li> A Nintendo Direct was supposed to come out on September 6th, 2018, but was delayed for a week due to the Hokkaido earthquake, which affected the company's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">home country</a>.
</li><li> The 2020 civil unrest following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police lead to the delaying of several video game-related events:
<ul><li> An event showcasing the Playstation 5 was originally slated for June 4, but wound up getting delayed to June 11 due to the protests. Sony stated that it was not the time for celebration, and that they wanted to "stand back and allow more important voices to be heard".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GameFreak">Game Freak</a> quietly delayed the announcement for the expansions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em> from its planned June 2 livestream in English-speaking regions for the same reason.
</li><li> The "Night City Wire" presentation for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cyberpunk2077" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cyberpunk2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em> was pushed back from June 11 to June 25 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CDProjektRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CDProjektRed">CD Projekt RED</a> in light of the events in Minneapolis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyModernWarfare2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyModernWarfare2019">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</a></em>'s fourth season was postponed from its original June 2 release date for similar reasons to the Playstation 5's delay. Additionally, the release of a season of an online military shooter would've been in poor taste, as some protests saw military action being taken to quell them.
</li></ul></li><li> At one point in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em> reveal stream for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS">Min Min</a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/hduxyp/sakurai_made_a_small_joke_about_social_distancing/">Sakurai makes a brief joke about social distancing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which is omitted from the official English subtitles, likely for this reason (the official subtitles simply say "They're far too close..."). This is despite the fact that the pandemic had been mentioned earlier in the broadcast to explain why Sakurai was recording the video from his home; presumably, bringing it up was considered okay, but not making a joke about it.
</li><li> In early September 2020, a livestream was supposed to reveal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a> as the next DLC character for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarvelsAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarvelsAvengers">Marvel's Avengers</a></em>. At the last minute, the decision was made to reveal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KateBishop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KateBishop">Kate Bishop</a> instead due to the tragic death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChadwickBoseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChadwickBoseman">Chadwick Boseman</a> just a few days prior.

Because the story is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicalDrama">Medical Drama</a> with mature themes that would be considered insensitive with the real life events that were taking place around the same time (the Coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement), Pixelberry decided to put the book on hiatus until September and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">rewrite some of the material so that the story wouldn't feel so untimely</a>. The events of the first two chapters released after the hiatus, which include people being quarantined after contracting an illness with seemingly no cure and a person of colour nearly dying after an attack instigated by a white man proved that Pixelberry made the right choice by putting the book on hiatus.
</li><li> Following a case of a 17-year old girl killing and dismembering an 8-year old girl in South Korea, who later was revealed to have been a regular participant of roleplaying communities, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony">Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</a></em> ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">banned in said country</a>, after she was thought to have copied the game, despite not specifically participating in <em>Danganronpa</em> roleplaying.

As such, he delayed the episode in order to put some distance between its release and Snyder's personal tragedy, a decision that he felt was vindicated when <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnBb0kCp-w4">his own father died<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the course of making the episode.

He got a warning from Mangadex about it (the phrase was used during the Christchurch mosque shootings), but it was let through since the chapter was released the same day and so may have been poorly timed. Two days later, another remix comic had a much more explicit reference (getting into a taxi with an assault rifle, asking the driver to take her to the nearest mosque, playing the same music in the video), and after asking him to remove only the remix from the release several times, the chapter was taken down.

</li><li> YouTuber Mini Ladd uploaded a video in September 2020, that was sponsored by Kove Audio. However, a couple of day later, some people reached out Kove on Twitter, saying that the YouTuber confirmed of sending inappropriate messages to underage fans earlier that year in June. Kove responded that they will no longer work with Mini Ladd, and therefore the video was removed.

</li><li> On May 1st, 2011, FOX's Sunday night Animation Domination line-up was supposed to include a three-part crossover special featuring all three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> cartoons (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em>, <em>Family Guy</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>) meeting each other during a hurricane. Sadly, because the Southern and Midwestern United States was already getting pounded by tornadoes and floods, the episodes were pulled at the last minute and replaced with reruns of their respective shows. The three-part crossover eventually aired on October 2nd, 2011.

The <em>Family Guy</em> episode aired the following week as it was pulled more due to its religious themes (with the regular cast retelling the Nativity story) than anything else, but the <em>American Dad</em> episode didn't air until December 15, 2013 since it has gun violence, along with an undeniable Christmas theme that would've been awkward to air in the middle of April, though most of this doesn't really matter, as most FOX affiliates interrupted all of their Sunday night programming with live coverage of the memorial service of the shooting victims.

The fact that someone put up a video claiming that the episode "predicted" the bombings by editing the two clips together (which Seth MacFarlane called "abhorrent") <em>really</em> didn't help matters.
</li><li> Three minutes before the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> was announced, BBC Three aired the <em>Family Guy</em> episode "Family Guy Viewer Mail #2," which has the story "Fatman and Robin," in which Peter wishes that everything he touched turned to Robin Williams, which leads to Peter attempting suicide several times over how annoying Williams' comedy is. Making matters worse, the episode ends with Peter cutting off his hands at the wrists (preventing himself from turning any more people into Robin Williams) which was one of Williams' attempted suicide methods in real life. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/robin-williams-family-guy-episode-4040030">Soon, negative comments flooded the internet about this coincidence<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and BBC banned it from ever airing again on their network. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> had the episode planned on their schedule on the day Robin Williams died too, but when news hit, they pulled the episode and aired another one. The episode has returned to rotation on all of these networks as of November 2017.

<ul><li> In the episode "The Vacation Goo," there's a scene where the family walks into the living room (after being tricked into taking a virtual reality trip in the vacation goo) to find Stan watching a Georgetown game on TV and wearing Georgetown gear. According to the DVD commentary, Stan was originally going to wear Virginia Tech gear and be a Virginia Tech fan, but then the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech happened, so they had to change it to a less controversial school at the time.
</li><li> In the episode "Francine's Flashback" the scene where Stan brings in Whitney Houston to sing a private apology performance for some cocaine was removed in airings following Houston's death (though the scene was eventually reinstated later), jumping straight from when Stan yells in horror from midnight fishing with his coworkers to Francine saying she will never forgive him for forgetting their anniversary.
</li><li> The ending to "Pulling Double Booty" originally involved Hayley taking a matchbook and setting fire to a forest after realizing Stan tricked her into dating him by pretending to be his body double, Bill. This ending was cut from the episode's premiere showings on FOX and Adult Swim due to a large wildfire in Southern California that occurred shortly before (making the episode end with Hayley yelling, "Oh my God! <em>Are you KIDDING ME?!</em>"). The ending is restored on syndicated airings and on DVD.

Originally scheduled to debut in 2011, the nuclear disaster in Japan that year as a result of the tsunami forced the show's Canadian producers to delay the season and edit it extensively to mitigate any sort of insensitive reference to anything that could be tied to the disaster, like renaming the "Radioactive Rats" as the "Toxic Rats" for instance. The season eventually debuted in 2012.
</li><li> Following Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash, MTV pulled a scheduled rerun the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em> episode "Sex, Lugs and Rock 'n' Roll'' in 2001, after the third segment of the episode showed every scene of car crashes in which it literately made light of fatal accidents, regardless of Earnhardt's death which made headline news during that time. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note89ylo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note89ylo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note89ylo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not to mention in the segment Earnhardt was fighting against Jeff Gordon, and Earnhardt actually won the match by crushing Gordon's body with his car, and landing it to the ground crushing him to a pulp by his back tire,</span> However, MTV actually brought this episode back from being banned.

In fact, two of the four remaining episodes of the show's third season - specifically, the episode in which Peggy visits a death row inmate and the episode with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Buckley</span>'s Angel - were almost not broadcast at all in Denver.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers">Bonkers</a></em> episodes "Fall Apart Bomb Squad" and "New Partners on the Block" (the latter of which is the first episode in which Bonkers' new partner is the blonde police officer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Miranda Wright</a>, due to Lucky Piquel's retirement from the force) were both pulled from the rotation following the 1995 Oklahoma bombings, and strangely never came back to the air even before 9/11. To the delight of fans, both episodes resurfaced in 2019 with the launch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a>, fixing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> caused by the latters absence.
</li><li> In addition to pulling the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> episode "Mass Transit Trouble" after 9/11 (the second time this happened; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TooSoon/SeptemberEleventh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TooSoon/SeptemberEleventh">that page</a> for more), Toon Disney also pulled "Magnificent Sonic" from rotation after the Columbine shooting due to extensive use of guns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Junior</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em> episode "Never Roar Again" was delayed from June 24th, 2016 to November 2016 after the incident at Walt Disney World's Grand Floridian hotel in which a child was killed by an alligator since a crocodile character played a major role in the episode.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DocMcStuffins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DocMcStuffins">Doc McStuffins: Toy Hospital</a></em> episode "First Responders to the Rescue" had its premiere on September 9, 2017, cancelled due to Hurricane Irma occurring on the same day, and the episode heavily featured a storm. The premiere was moved to September 23, but it was still released on demand and on the app the day of its intended release.
</li><li> An encore of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyAndTheRoadsterRacers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyAndTheRoadsterRacers">Mickey and the Roadster Racers</a></em> episode "Ye Old Royal Heist/Tea Time Trouble", which takes place in London, was meant to be shown on June 4, 2017, but was pulled from airing that day due to the London attacks happening not too long beforehand. Fortunately, it was back into rotation.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FancyNancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FancyNancy">Fancy Nancy</a></em> episode "Camp Fancy/Nancy's Vanity D'Art" was originally meant to air on August 24, 2018, but was moved to three weeks later on September 14. This is because the former segment involved a rainstorm, which would be seen as insensitive due to Hurricane Lane hitting Hawaii.

The constant mass shootings force the producers of the action movie <em>Ms. Taken</em> to keep editing out scenes with gun violence until the movie is reduced to be about five seconds long and cancelled altogether.
</li><li> On May 14th, 2019, the official Twitter for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Animated_Antic/status/1128489250587009025">posted a tweet<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> quoting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TheUglyBarnacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TheUglyBarnacle">The Ugly Barnacle</a></em> on the same day Tim Conway &mdash; who voiced recurring character Barnacle Boy &mdash; died of complications from brain surgery. After fans complained, the tweet was removed.
<ul><li> A similar incident happened when the Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> Twitter account <a class="urllink" href="https://soranews24.com/2015/08/11/disneys-japanese-twitter-account-calls-anniversary-of-nagasaki-bombing-nothing-special-day/">tweeted a post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> themed after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> which said "A very merry unbirthday to you!" in English accompanied by a picture of Alice holding a birthday cake, with the Japanese translation, "Happy nothing special day!", <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10splh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10splh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10splh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In Japanese, the word for "unbirthday", "otanjyoubi jya nai hi" requires nine syllables compared to the three found in "unbirthday", so "The Unbirthday Song" used the phrase "nandemo nai hi", or "nothing special day", in the places where "unbirthday" was used in the original.</span> on the 70th anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing. Disney later apologized for the mistake.

<ul><li> Re-runs of the episode "Cannonball" were pulled because said episode revolved around the titular experiment causing tsunamis. It was put back in rotation two months later.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessWinfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessWinfield">Jess Winfield</a>, the episode "Ace" <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ersoz.com/storyboard/sb_pages/ls_ace.htm">was supposed to have a scene where Lilo, Stitch and some of the experiments create a tidal wave<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to impress the head of E.G.O. with Pleakley playing a victim until, thanks to the episode's titular experiment, he unintentionally <em>becomes</em> the victim. Winfield and his staff thought it was insensitive to the victims of the tragedy, so they turned the episode into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> in which Jumba shows the head of E.G.O. videos of the experiments.

Instead of being a mid-season replacement as originally intended, it aired in the fall of 2004.
</li><li> Several animated shows were affected by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusPandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoronavirusPandemic">Coronavirus Pandemic</a> in early 2020:
<ul><li> Reruns of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Amphibia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Amphibia">Amphibia</a></em> episode "Contagi-Anne" were pulled from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> because of the plot of Anne pretending to be sick so she can skip doing her chores. It's still on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a>, though.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens">Big City Greens</a></em> episode "Cricket's Shoes" was pulled from reruns on both Disney Channel and Disney XD, because it involved Cricket getting sick and at one point, he goes outside when he shouldn't, and twice at the beginning and end, he sneezes and gets his germs all over Bill's face.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> app pulled the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaoMaoHeroesOfPureHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaoMaoHeroesOfPureHeart">Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart</a></em> episode "Sick Mao", the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears">We Bare Bears</a></em> episode "Bubble" and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> episode "Body Adventure'' after the coronavirus pandemic. Ironically, a clip from "Bubble" depicting all the germs Panda sees on the subway circulated the internet during the pandemic due to its relevance.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramarama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramarama">Total Dramarama</a></em> episode "Germ Factory" was pulled because in the episode, the toddlers intentionally try to get themselves sick.
</li><li> Also removed were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CraigOfTheCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CraigOfTheCreek">Craig of the Creek</a></em> ("The Last Kid of the Creek"), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SummerCampIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SummerCampIsland">Summer Camp Island</a></em> ("Sneeze Guard"), and two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bakugan">Bakugan</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> shorts.
</li><li> On March 16, 2020, PBS affiliate <a class="urllink" href="https://imgur.com/a/o5vLaKE">WNET, which is based in New York City,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the epicenter of the virus, aired the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanielTigersNeighborhood"> Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood</a></em> episode "Daniel Gets a Cold; Mom Tiger Is Sick". While this might have been a way for children to cope with the coronavirus epidemic that was currently going on, said repeat wound up airing as every other broadcast station in the area <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeInterruptThisProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeInterruptThisProgram">broke into special reports about local governments making businesses shut down for two weeks as a preventative measure</a>. A rerun of this same episode was planned for March 26th for most PBS affiliates (before they, too, wound up pulling reruns of that episode); Thirteen wound up pre-empting it and instead aired "Daniel Is Jealous; Jealousy at the Treehouse". It returned to regular rotation in September 2020, but the episode was offered on the PBS Kids app during this period.
</li><li> Boomerang removed reruns of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> episodes "Peace and Quiet; Wanted: Wade; Garfield Goes Hawaiian" and "Attention-Getting Garfield; Swine Trek; It Must Be True!" from their channel because the plot of the third segment in the former episode involves Garfield catching the Hawaiian Cat Flu, despite the symptoms of the illness not resembling what one would consider to be the flu, and the second segment in the latter episode has its' plot spurred from Orson being sick in bed. Both are still on the Boomerang app, however, and the former episode returned on June 26, 2020.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LouAndLouSafetyPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LouAndLouSafetyPatrol">Lou and Lou: Safety Patrol</a></em> episode "Don't Get The Flu" was pulled from DisneyNow due to the pandemic, despite the short's lessons on not spreading germs being the kind of thing networks were airing to <em>help</em> kids during the pandemic.
</li><li> Reruns of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PuppyDogPals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PuppyDogPals">Puppy Dog Pals</a> episode "Land Of The Rising Pup/ARF-choo!" were temporarily pulled from March to May 2020, because the latter segment dealt with A.R.F. catching a virus due to not completing a reboot.
</li><li> Reruns of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> episode "Sean Has a Cold" and its sister episode "Mars Rock for Mom" were pulled because of the former being about, well, Sean having a cold. It wouldn't air again until May 8. Since the pandemic was still going on around this time, some affiliates aired the episode in an early morning death slot to avoid a repeat of the <em>Daniel Tiger</em> incident. This included the aformentioned WNET, which wound up swapping <em>Ready Jet Go</em>'s timeslot with a re-run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>, the show that normally airs at 6AM.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> reruns of "Suds" and "Squid-itis" were pulled.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> pulled reruns of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> episode "Threat Levels" due to its A-plot involving Stan accidentally bringing home a deadly virus causing the CIA to put the whole family under quarantine.
</li><li> Adult Swim also pulled reruns of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> episode "Flu-ouise", due to its A-plot involving Louise getting a flu.
</li><li> The 7th episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CleopatraInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CleopatraInSpace">Cleopatra in Space</a></em> , "Quarentine" which involved almost everyone in school getting sick, was not put up on the Peacock streaming service in America.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> episodes "One Flu Over the Loud House" and its sister episode "The Price of Admission" have been pulled from airing by Nickelodeon due to the former being eerily too similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. The episodes are still available for streaming on CBS All Access.
</li></ul></li><li> After <em>Surviving R. Kelly</em> came out in 2019, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> pulled reruns of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheBoondocksS1E2TheTrialOfRKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheBoondocksS1E2TheTrialOfRKelly">The Trial of R. Kelly</a>". Ironically, this happened right when Huey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> aimed at R. Kelly and everyone dancing in court went viral. The episode returned to rotation near the end of the year.
</li><li> In A Wild Hare, one of the first Bugs Bunny cartoons and the first cartoon to use the finalized Bugs vs. Elmer format, Bugs covers Elmer's eyes from behind and asks him to guess who. Elmer guesses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaroleLombard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaroleLombard">Carole Lombard</a>. A year later, Lombard died in a tragic plane crash, and a new line where Elmer instead guessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraStanwyck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbaraStanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a> was recorded and used in all subsequent releases of the short.
</li><li> On June 10th, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies">Bubble Guppies</a></em> episode "The Police Cop-Etition!" was pulled from both reruns and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr">Nick Jr.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noggin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noggin">Noggin</a> apps due to the murder of George Floyd by police. A re-run was slated to air two days after it was pulled from the apps on the Nick Jr. channel, but got replaced with one of "Come To Your Senses!" the day before.
</li><li> Being that one of its main canine characters is a police officer, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> suffered from a nasty case of this due to the death of George Floyd:
<ul><li> First, the social media accounts for the show went dark for five days in rememberance of George Floyd. After people complained about the posts specifically because of Chase, the accounts did not post anything for a month.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr">Nick Jr.</a> website features a specific character as the icon for their shows (for instance, Molly for <em>Bubble Guppies</em> and Blue for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesCluesAndYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BluesCluesAndYou">Blue's Clues &amp; You!</a></em>), with Chase being the character icon for <em>PAW Patrol</em>. On June 17th, 2020, the icon was changed to Marshall. This strangely did not affect its international sites, however.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noggin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Noggin">Noggin</a></em> app also changed its' icon for <em>PAW Patrol</em> from Chase to Marshall. Because of his promotion to icon status, the ads for the app themselves, which used Marshall, now used Skye instead to avoid confusion.
</li><li> Two Ultimate Rescue episodes ("Pups Save The Royal Kitties" and "Pups Stop A Meltdown; Pups And The Mystery of the Missing Cellphones") were pulled from rotation because in the episodes, the other pups become police officers like Chase.
</li><li> Nick Jr's advertising for their summer programming line-up used Rex and Marshall rather than Chase as was the case with previous ad campaigns.
</li><li> Finally, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.lawofficer.com/paw-patrol-remains-on-air-but-chase-removed-from-some-previews/">some streaming providers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> removed Chase from promotional artwork.
</li><li> An example not involving Chase: Deann Degruijter, the voice of Mayor Goodway, was replaced by Kim Roberts for similar reasons to the replacement of the voices for non-white characters on <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>Family Guy</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> episode "Vacation" has rarely aired since 2003 is because it contains a scene in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expys</a> of Siegfeld and Roy are attacked by tigers.
</li><li> The short lived cartoon <em>Pro Stars</em> originally had a theme song with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToTheTuneOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToTheTuneOf">new lyrics set to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s "We Will Rock You". This was rather appropriate, given that the song is a staple of sporting events and the main characters were fictionalized versions of famous athletes (Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, and Bo Jackson). Unfortunately, Queen frontman Freddie Mercury died from AIDS a couple of months into the show's run and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacedTheThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacedTheThemeTune">a new theme song had to be used.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/thatonesixfour/status/1270069178020564992?s=20">was to feature a Silly Song about tornado hunting<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on <em>Robin Good and His Not-So-Merry Men</em>, but was cut due to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak_of_March_2<!--E2-->80%933,_2012">a tornado outbreak that occured around the time of the video's production<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

</li></ul></li><li> After the Virginia Tech shooting, many colleges cracked down on the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LARP/HumansVsZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LARP/HumansVsZombies">Humans vs. Zombies</a></em> for this reason, either banning it outright or banning the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/NerfBrand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/NerfBrand">Nerf guns</a>. Even today, several years later, some schools are still squeamish about the game.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidgygate#Squidgygate_II.3F">The British Sunday papers were caught badly on the wrong foot about reporting the death of Princess Diana,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> because it occurred very late on a Saturday night. The most the tabloids could do was to replace their original front pages hastily with respectful coverage of what was known about the tragedy. The inside pages, including opinion pieces written earlier in the week, reflected the previous orthodoxy about Diana: that she was a dumb blonde who intended to bring down the Royal Family with the maximum embarrassment and was most likely going to present them with a half-Arab sibling for William and Harry. The complaints caused much embarrassment among hacks, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Stalinist revision</a> made by the papers after her death was probably the most noteworthy thing.

</li><li> The blockbuster comedy album <em>The First Family</em> and its sequel were yanked from shelves after the assassination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. The producers even destroyed all the unsold copies, as they didn't want to be seen as "cashing in" on such a horrific tragedy. Because of this, original copies of the sequel are now highly valued collector's items.
</li><li> British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer <a class="urllink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/style/743849/marks-and-spencer-isis-perfume-aqua-rebrand-islamic-state">renamed their Isis perfume into Aqua, for obvious reasons.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> On February 14, 2018, around the same time as the mass shooting at a school in Parkland, FL was taking place, the NRA posted a tweet for Valentine's Day saying "Buy your loved one a gun". The tweet was soon deleted in response to the tragedy.
</li><li> In 2002, German consumer engineering conglomerate Siemens - Bosch proposed to revive a tradename which had not been used in Germany for over fifty years and which had fallen from use with nobody hurrying to pick it up. They proposed to use the trademark <em>Zyklon</em> (Cyclone) for a range of consumer goods covering kitchen and domestic appliances - including their latest model Zyklon gas oven. They had to be reminded about the previous associations of the name - the Zyklon-B poison gas used in death camps by the Nazis - and were asked if attaching the name to a gas oven was all <em>that</em> inspired as a marketing strategy.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://toybook.com/lego-pulling-back-potentially-sensitive-product-amid-george-floyd-protests/">Lego asked stores<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to remove any marketing for Lego products that feature police, as well as a donut shop and the White House, after protests erupted in 2020 over the killing of George Floyd.
</li></ul></li><li> As a result of the protests concerning George Floyd's death in the United States (and via similar moves by both Disney and Warner Bros. Studios), Hallmark pulled two ornaments from its' 2020 line-up: a Mickey Mouse ornament that played "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SongOfTheSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SongOfTheSouth">Song of the South</a></em> (to coincide with the removal of the Splash Mountain ride) and an ornament depicting Scarlet O'Hara from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Gone with the Wind</a></em> (even though it was made AFTER the film returned to HBO Max).
