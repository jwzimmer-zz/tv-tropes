They keep a series moving at a good pace, give it a greater sense of purpose, unity, and forethought, and generally help keep up interest in the story as a whole.
</p><p>Unless they go on and on. And on. And on. For months, if not years.
</p><p>Suddenly, the arcs stop keeping up interest and instead lead to fan outcry for a conclusion already! Eventually, the pace of a story may become so monotonously slow and/or repetitious that the fanbase at large give up on following the series directly, and instead rely on <em>Reader's Digest</em> versions of the stories, as told by their friends who still give a damn.
</p><p>When this happens, a story has succumbed to Arc Fatigue. Possible reasons for this are:
</p><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Arc</a> Stall:</strong> An individual story arc has carried on for an annoyingly long time, and yet there's still no end in sight. This usually occurs when the amount of time taken to tell an individual arc becomes horrendously disproportional to the amount of time that's passed in-universe (for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime">taking several years to publish a story whose events supposedly happen within the span of a few hours</a>), leading to a critical breakdown of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief">Suspension of Disbelief</a>. This form of stall is most common in "The Continuing Adventures of"-style stories, which chronicle the many exploits of a character or group of characters, rather than have a set end-goal planned.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth</a> Stall:</strong> The story has been going on for a long time. A <em>loooooooong</em> time. Teenagers in the present time weren't even born when the story began, and yet the characters are no closer to their final goal than they were five years ago. Sometimes, the story is riddled with storylines which may be little more than a prolonged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> story with no significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> or Plot Advancement at all. In extreme circumstances, the series might "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">end</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">only when the author does...</a> This is, naturally, most common in "quest" stories where the characters have an over-arching goal to achieve or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> to claim. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">The Chris Carter Effect</a>.
</p><p>Note that in particularly ridiculous examples, a series may suffer from Myth Stall because it's laden with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> Arcs suffering from Arc Stall. The difficult part is not necessarily the fact that there is a running story, but the fact that the story has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Driving Question</a> that is constantly teased but never resolved.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The reasons for a series slipping into Arc Fatigue are many, but the most common are that either the author is stalling for time while trying to figure out where the series is heading, or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">someone higher up</a> wants to carry on the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">for as long as it's profitable</a>. Alternatively, the author may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingForTheTrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingForTheTrade">Writing for the Trade</a>. There is also the possibility of a writer-reader disconnect: the writer may be thinking he's writing an older-style serial where the myth arc is the motivation for the character to do his episode-to-episode stuff rather than a goal they're actively trying to move toward (characteristic of westerns and detective stories, where the initial unsolved murder-mystery or dishonor is the reason the protagonist is going around doing good, but not something they actually think to be resolvable).

Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExponentialPlotDelay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExponentialPlotDelay">Exponential Plot Delay</a> (the fatigue gets worse as the plot progresses), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">Ending Fatigue</a> (when it seems like it will end, but it doesn't), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue">Prolonged Prologue</a> (when the work is moving slowly before the story proper even begins), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">The Chris Carter Effect</a> (which is a possible audience reaction to this).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>:
<ul><li> How some fans think about the God of Death arc, which lasted around thirteen chapters. The anime averts this by a long shot, completing the entire arc in just two episodes... though, instead, it gets some complaints for being a rushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">Pragmatic Adaptation</a>.
</li><li> In a variation, everything after Chapter 153, largely because, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Class E firmly defeating Class A and Koro-sensei's life largely safe</span>, the series has very little to actually <em>do</em>. As a result, much of February drags with the students doing various things, leaving many fans wishing for Matsui to just get to the final arc already.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: The Internship Arc's total size is slightly more than twice the size of the previous longest arc, for a total of 46 chapters, the arc dragged on through an entire year, which is to say a lot in a manga with very short and to-the-point arcs. Adopting the "flashback in the middle of fights" trope that this manga mostly avoids certainly made the fights longer than whats usual for the manga (some of which were chapters long). The author himself admitted near the end of the arc that it was too long and many fans were vocal that the arc, while good, overstayed its welcome.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Even before <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, the series had its fair share of filler and padding to avoid catching up to the source material, but it gets especially bad during the Red Ribbon Army saga, perhaps reaching its worst point in the General Blue portions, which include episodes where Goku and friends spend the whole time essentially running around in circles to escape a robot pirate, with certain shots and sequences of animation repeated over and over again. It all results in an arc that takes a lot longer to get through in the anime than it does in the manga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: An example so infamous that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">recut the series</a> just to make it more palatable. In the original manga, the Frieza and Cell sagas are of the exact same length and <em>both</em> the longest arcs (the Buu Saga has more chapters than both, but they tend to be a lot shorter). The Cell Saga, however, gets off lighter than the Frieza Saga simply due to actually being able to <em>change location/scenery</em>.
<ul><li> The Namek/Frieza Saga(s). While not the most blatant examples, they are by far the most (in)famous. Several of the episodes consisted of just characters speaking or flying from one place to another, with very few fight sequences to break it all up. One episode was just Bulma tricking two of Frieza's henchmen into looking for the Dragon Balls, which turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">Bizarro Episode</a> after the henchmen were gone since it had no impact on the saga's plot at all. "Are they still on Namek?" (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes">original name for this trope</a>) has become the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme</a> when referring to any story arc that seems to be dragging on for too long. Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em> when Krillin randomly notes at one point that "We're <em>still</em> on Namek!" For reference, that was in the twenty-fourth episode, and they'd landed on Namek in the <em>thirteenth</em>, while the entire Saiyan Saga was covered in ten episodes. For the record, the Frieza Saga clocked in at twenty episodes, the last of which was again not half as long, not twice as long, but <em>triple</em> the length of the regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeamFourStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeamFourStar">TFS</a> parody episodes, which means they actually spent approximately <em>22</em> episodes on Namek.
</li><li> The Cell Games. Midway through <a class="urllink" href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/The_Horror_Won%27t_End">episode 190<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Cell starts to charge up a Kamehameha. Following a flashback, Goku telepathically tells Gohan that he can still win this, and Gohan starts preparing his own Kamehameha. The two launch their attacks right at the beginning of the next episode&mdash;and are deadlocked for the <em>entire episode</em>. Of course, this lasted one manga chapter too, only 14 pages aren't exactly the same as 22 minutes.
</li><li> TFS' <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESDAXKC2418">Dragon Ball Z Kai Abridged Episode 2<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> managed to condense the Frieza Saga even further down to <strong>seven minutes in length</strong>... which is still around <em>three</em> times longer than DBZ Kai Abridged 1, which clocks in at two minutes and 10 seconds.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Universal Survival Arc</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, has been inconsistently hit with this. After a setup that took twenty episodes mostly spent gathering team members and watching the arena be built (for the former, the intro made Universe 7's whole lineup clear beforehand <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except for Frieza replacing Buu</span>), the actual tournament started and was initially well-received for its wild action and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/VisualEffectsOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/VisualEffectsOfAwesome">Visual Effects of Awesome</a>. However, as the tournament has gone on significantly longer than even the Future Trunks arc &mdash; despite, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence">in classic</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence">Dragon Ball</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InactionSequence">fashion</a>, the tournament only lasting 48 minutes in-universe &mdash; it's started to fall into fatigue territory. While some fans enjoy the unique battles and non-stop action, others have criticized many of the fights for being glorified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> that lack plot progression or emotional impact. This reached a head when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Jiren</a> took prominence as the clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, doing away much of the tension and appeal of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Battle Royale</a> since it's clear from early on that it will come down to a final battle between Jiren and Goku (in his latest new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>) while the other battles just serve to waste time and whittle down the cast.

<ul><li> While it was a relatively minor offender compared to later storylines, the Soul Society Arc is said to have dragged on for longer than necessary, because it expanded the cast by a factor of about three and all the new characters needed time to be fleshed out. Compounding the problem was the sudden change of tone and format, going from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a> to a much more action-oriented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a>. Fans who were particularly fond of the coming-of-age teenage drama of the early chapters found the move towards more standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen">Sh&#333;nen</a> fights disappointing.
</li><li> The Arrancar Arc spanned chapters 183-423, four publication years and an additional four anime years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a> had never intended it to be so long but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> insisted on the unexpectedly popular Arrancar each receiving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>. The arc slowed down to a crawl as even minion fights were given lavish screen time. The arc spawned the meme "Are they still in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spexico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spexico">Mexico</a>?" and the anime often interrupted the canon storyline in mid-action to insert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> arcs whenever it caught up to the manga.
</li><li> The first anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> arc, the Bount Arc heavily padded its episodes to include content that was pointless to both the storyline and setting. Despite minimal new characters (by <em>Bleach</em> standards), the arc was at least as long as the Soul Society Arc.
</li><li> It happened again during the Blood War arc, specifically the start of the Vandenreich's second invasion of Soul Society. Complaints seem to be similar to those against the battle in Fake Karakura Town, namely that it's a seemingly endless series of fights against bad guys who usually only get a minimum of characterization before getting offed. However, the last leg of the arc ended up inverting this; due to the manga author's swiftly failing health, the manga was so abruptly wrapped up that the last stretch was heavily compressed and extremely rushed, with many new, game-changing plot points being brought up without ever really being fully touched upon.
</li></ul></li><li> The late episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LadyJewelpet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LadyJewelpet">Lady Jewelpet</a></em> involving the Beasts and the Door to Chaos are often considered the weakest part of the show. It seems to go on forever with several characters going through melodramatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">deaths that aren't</a> (in at least one case, multiple times), Momona's indecision being a retread of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetHappiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetHappiness">Chiari's</a>, and Elena's tacked-on character development.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Enies Lobby arc, the backstory of the main villain, Rob Lucci, is cut down from a full flashback to a brief summary. The author stated that this was because the arc, combined with the Water 7 arc that proceeded it and led directly into its events, was already running quite long, and a flashback in the middle of the climactic fight would have slowed the pacing down even more. The flashback was shown in full in the anime.
</li><li> The Skypeia arc has also caught some flak for this, given its length compared to, at the time, its relative unimportance <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1j4ye');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1j4ye" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1j4ye');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While the arc contributes little to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>, it introduces several concepts that would later be pivotal to the narrative</span> to the rest of the story. The real punch to the gut in the Skypeia arc was that Luffy's fight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> essentially "ended" a full 17 chapters before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was finally "defeated." The seven chapter-long flashback didn't help either, interrupting the arc's climax in favor of two months of exposition.
</li><li> The Straw Hat Separation Saga and <em>especially</em> the Marineford arc are also considered this, as the concept puts everyone but Luffy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>, and the latter is largely one very long, drawn-out battle sequence. To put this into perspective: When the Straw Hats started heading for Sabaody Archipelago, that was chapter 490. After the Straw Hats got split up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, met up again and then finally headed down to Fishman island, that was chapter 602. For those keeping track, that's exactly 112 chapters, not even including the month-long hiatus that the manga went on for the time skip.
</li><li> Fishman Island in the anime. Due to the anime's "one episode equals one chapter" pacing, Fishman Island really dragged on TV. All subsequent arcs falls victim to this too or worse&mdash;some episodes in the Punk Hazard arc used only <em>half</em> of a chapter's worth of story. One such episode consisted almost solely of Sanji, Nami, Franky, and Chopper running across a day care room with little happening besides banter.
</li><li> Dressrosa eventually became the longest arc in the series by a large margin, lasting exactly one hundred chapters; the aforementioned Skypiea Arc lasted only 66 chapters. The fact that the arc had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, even by <em>One Piece</em> standards, did it no favors. It also set up other imminent events in addition to those already ongoing, building up anticipation for the arc itself to get itself over with. True to form, the Dressrosa Arc in the anime was <em>historically</em> slow. Much of every episode's content drastically extends the scenes with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlePeople">Tontatta</a> or the coliseum fights, as well as adding in tons of things to stall the Straw Hats. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fairness, the huge cast was semi-justified as many characters in the arc would become part of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, but it still dragged in many fans eyes.</span>

<ul><li> The martial-arts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> that lasted from Chapters 58 to 71 in the manga ended up being quite fatiguing for some readers, particularly with ONE and Murata's long pauses, not to mention the focus was on a massive monster breakout that occurred during the tournament that resulted in many one-off heroes battling the monsters, rather than on Saitama&#146;s arc. As a result, many felt that the arc was detracting from the central plot. It also doesn't help that the arc can be seen as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a>" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2jjeu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2jjeu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2jjeu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The tournament arc was ONE's idea, so it's technically canon</span> for being smack dab in the middle of the ongoing "Hero Hunter Garou Arc", which is a sore spot for the fans that wish to finally see the Garou storyline conclude.
</li><li> What can be summed up as the "Monster Association" arc or the Human Monster Saga in relation to Garou suffers from excessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> and redraws of already finished chapters. Beginning in July of 2017 with Chapter 78, the plot has fallen to a snail's pace because of the number of chapters spent on the Heroes fighting random one-off monsters that don't add much to the storytelling other than showing off the powers of the heroes. The "final battle" between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tatsumaki and the Monster Queen Psykorochi</span> has been going on since early 2020 and at time of writing, the story arc still doesn't seem like it's close to ending.
</li><li> On the flip side, reading the whole thing in one go after it's completed flow pretty well so perhaps it could be argued that at least part of the problem is having to wait a few weeks for each update while you know there's a big climax about to happen.

<ul><li> Effectively <em>every arc</em> excluding the Orange Islands is prone to this, as the series' source material (apart from a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> arcs) is a game whose installments are released three to four years apart rather than a weekly manga.
</li><li> <strong>Kanto</strong> was only around 80 episodes depending on the inclusion/disregard of a couple banned episodes. However, it had one particularly long gap that occurred between the 6th and 7th gym badges at 27 episodes (29 if you count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PokemonHolidayHiJynx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PokemonHolidayHiJynx">Holiday Hi-Jynx</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PokemonSnowWayOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PokemonSnowWayOut">Snow Way Out</a>). There was also about 10 episodes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> after the 8th badge, which amounted to Ash basically sitting at home waiting for the Kanto league to start. It was around this time that Japan had realized that they had an anime-hit on their hand, so they had to extend the series in some way before the release of the Johto games (Hence, the 36 episode long <strong>Orange Islands</strong> which served as a substitute for an Elite Four arc).
</li><li> <strong>Johto</strong>: 158 episodes. Compounded by the fact that there was only one main quest (Contests and the like would not be introduced until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">the next season</a>). Some contend that the Whirl Islands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">Special Guest</a> arcs could've been removed, but that would have had the tied-for-4th longest gap between badges (27 episodes) succeeded by what would have been the <em>shortest</em> gap (1 episode, usurping Kanto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Boulder-Cascade's and Marsh-Rainbow</a> gaps of <em>2</em>).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yneu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3yneu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yneu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Whirl Islands arc, in total, lasted only 14 episodes, 15 if you count the battle with Jasmine.</span>
</li><li> <strong>Hoenn</strong>: 132 episodes. It was made less bad by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting">the addition of Contests</a>, though a case can be made for the Petalburg-Rustboro &amp; Dewford Island arcs, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowPacedBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowPacedBeginning">were early on</a> and paced slowly. The Team Aqua and Team Magma arcs suffered the reverse of this, as many felt they could have had more focus and build-up than they got, and the conclusion to their arc was seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">rushed.</a>
</li><li> <strong>Battle Frontier</strong>: 60 Episodes. Inverted in that most of the filler was in the beginning, leading to a faster pace with the rest of the arc.
</li><li> <strong>Sinnoh</strong>: 191 episodes. As much as the above 2-part saga in total. It also holds the record for both the longest and second longest gaps between Gym battles, with 31 episodes between Gardenia and Maylene and <strong>52</strong> episodes between Candice and Volkner.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4l3iv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4l3iv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4l3iv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Kanto actually has the 3rd longest at 28 between Koga and Blaine.</span> Granted, these gaps developed the buildup and resolution, respectively, of <em>both</em> the Contest and Team Galactic arcs, and further justified by the distance between those two Gyms, but that still meant that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">main quest</a> was demoted to <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdLineSomeWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdLineSomeWaiting">C-Plot</a></strong> status <em>twice</em>.
</li><li> The <strong>Unova</strong> series averts this trope with its fast pace, but that results in the 142 episode saga suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">a different trope</a>. Ash got all 8 of his badges in 84 episodes, though the gap between #3 and #4 was pretty long (27 episodes, T-4th).

This was followed by a 14-episode arc revolving around N and Team Plasma which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">people are heavily divided on</a>. The quick pace ultimately resulted in the last 5 months prior to the release of the Gen VI games having an Orange Islands/Battle Frontier-style round of pure, aimless island-hopping filler, only <em>without</em> a pseudo-tournament like those arcs had. The subsequent ratings drop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">show the extent of the wear and tear</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Kalos</strong> has started off on a rough note with the drop in ratings that occurred during BW's Decolore Islands arc. Its first season was subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">Padding</a> after the first ten episodes. Serena was virtually pointless until <em>finally</em> discovering a goal for herself around 40 episodes in, and the Kalos gang was forced to take part in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">side-journey</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> in Korrina for several episodes that hardly anyone got invested in due to there being no payoff in the end for helping her complete her quest to properly use a Lucarionite. It took until Ash got his <strong>7th</strong> gym badge before Team Flare even appeared. At this point the plot picked up momentum, especially when Ash's Greninja obtained an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">exclusive form</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Alola</strong>: Coming off the high from the XY&amp;Z saga, the plot had changed drastically from one where Ash traveling from gym to gym to earn badges to one where he attends a Pokemon School. Not only is Ash generally staying in one place, but the human cast size is the largest it has ever been with Ash and <em>5</em> other reoccurring classmates. The Island Trials are present as well, but the pace is a bit slower due to how many characters the show must juggle now.

</li><li> The WRGP/ZONE/Yliaster/whatever arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> takes this to a new extreme &mdash; unlike the fairly paced Fortune Cup arc (26 episodes) and Dark Signer arc (38 episodes), it drags on unbelievably &mdash; Episode 65 introduces the audience to the W.R.G.P. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">tournament</a>, but the actual tournament doesn't start until episode 98, and it doesn't end until episode 137, 73 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">whole episodes.</a> And since the Ark Cradle arc that immediately follows it resolves the plot that started in it, you can add its 14 episodes for a whopping 87 episodes from start to finish.
</li><li> The Synchro Dimension arc <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em> started off with a clear purpose of rallying the dimension's people to fight against the evil Academia. The problem is that the characters are separated upon arrival (for some reason) and, given no direction, just run around like chickens with their heads cut off before getting arrested for suspicious activity. They then get thrown in jail, meet and befriend a prisoner, get caught during an escape, and are forced to take part in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> in order to show the authority of the city they're in that they are powerful enough to fight against Academia. While the padding allowed them to do some worldbuilding and introduce Crow and Shinji, the plot could have easily gone straight to the Friendship Cup and built on things there, rather than spend 13 episodes of the characters wandering around without a goal beyond "let's just get back together and go from there." There's also the fact that the subplot of Yuya and Yuzu being separated has effectively enveloped <em>half of the series</em>. The two are reunited for <em>one episode</em> before they are separated again.
</li><li> Though the Zarc arc in <em>V</em> isn't actually that long, lasting five episodes, it falls into this for being dedicated to a single duel, and for four of those episodes just being all the other protagonists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">trying and failing to scratch him</a> before getting flattened. The fact that it was pretty obvious from the beginning how it was going to end didn't help it. And then, even though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is defeated, it gets followed up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">eight episodes of rather directionless duels</a> held together with the excuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">making an evil baby smile.</a>

Akamatsu had realized the arc was starting to drag and decided to drop a few mini-arcs on the tail end to avoid making the problem worse.
</li><li> The Magical World arc may have dragged on more than needed as well. It finally ended, taking nearly <em>half</em> the manga's run to complete. It did solve a lot of loose plot ends at least.

Endless Eight. <em>Eight episodes</em> of the exact same events with minor variations, adapted out of a single short story. Especially since the novels' "Endless Eight" only concerned one particular time loop (the last one), and was about at most 30 pages. Eight episodes equals almost three hours. This angered fans who wanted an epic six-episode <em>Disappearance</em> adaption (adapted out of a single <em>novel</em>)... The latter did come out as a feature-length movie however: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the second longest animated feature ever created, at 2 hours 43 minutes in length!</a> (One minute shorter than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Final Yamato</a></em>).

It was also such a massive, confusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> that even the series creator admitted it was dragging. Not a new trend, however, because previously <em>Fujiyama Gangsta Paradise</em> did the same at 16 out of 37 chapters. <em>Baile de la Muerte</em> is still more infamous among fans of the series, because immediately following the arc's conclusion, the manga was hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a>.
</li><li> Two simultaneous battles taking place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> last ten entire books with little else going on.

This means that arc is actually longer than the rest of the arcs combined! The storyline has been stretched to the point where battles have just been rehashed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">e.g. The choice battle which ended up amounting to nothing other than a bit of exposition at the end</span> as well as introducing new characters that could have only been done to stretch the plot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Let me introduce you to the <strong>real</strong> 6 Funeral Wreaths!" Thus rendering all of the other battles utterly pointless.</span> The introduction of the motorbikes also adds to the meaningless filler since they were only used for five minutes before being destroyed.

Said arc has been going on for over five years now and has gone on for more than 160 chapters. To put it in context, Yude has spent more time on one tournament arc than any other arc previously.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em>, there's this whole deal with Fumi's confession to Akira. Since the relationship between the girls is central to the story, this arc is stalled immensely, mostly by having a confused Akira run around in circles.
<ul><li> The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a> arc also drags on much longer than necessary.
</li><li> And then there's the whole story about Kyouko and Kou's engagement, which mainly seems to serve to show that Kyouko is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians">not lesbian after all</a></span>.

The arc has lasted 132 chapters, but in real time took over <em>nine years</em>&mdash;the manga was only six years old when it started.
</li><li> The Asgard arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>. One of the main appeals of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> is that the fights, while epic, would last about one episode with a couple of exceptions. The problem with the Asgard arc is that every fight consisted of one of the Saints encountering a God Warrior, fight for about three episodes, the God Warrior gives a backstory and it repeats all over again. One fight in particular lasts four episodes. Ratings dropped so much that the series was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a> with the comparatively short Poseidon Saga and the no Hades Saga until years later. Unsurprisingly, this is the one arc that is 100% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">anime-only</a>.
</li><li> One single fight on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NEEDLESS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NEEDLESS">NEEDLESS</a></em> anime takes <strong>nine</strong> episodes out of 24.

Usually, backstory arcs take up a few chapters and it does give readers some background to some characters, but that particular arc drags on <em>way longer</em> than it should have been.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WolfGuyWolfenCrest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WolfGuyWolfenCrest">Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest</a></em> had a very, very, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> arc fatigue when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ms. Aoshika was horrifically gang-raped by Haguro and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">yakuza</a> for nearly 18 chapters</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> For a manga that is generally good at keeping its arcs at a short length without rushing them, the series has the Grand Magic Games arc, which is over 70 chapters long. The first part of the arc (which is, essentially, about the Fairy Tail world's equivalent of the Olympic Games) was not too bad with most games and fights usually only lasting somewhere in-between a half chapter and two chapters. However, the final day of the Games keeps going for over 20 chapters. Meanwhile, several of the 20 chapters are spent on a side-plot about Natsu and his friends who are captured in the royal castle. They do almost nothing but fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> soldiers and executioners who just keep returning only to get beaten again.
</li><li> The arc dealing with the last dark guild standing Tartaros is also accused of this, despite generally being considered one of the best arcs in the story, for specifically two points near the end. The first is the countdown of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">Face</a>. We start with it seemingly getting destroyed about 10 chapters after it emerges, only to reveal 3000 more and initiate another countdown that actually reaches 0, then we go back 20 minutes before this and have several chapters ultimately leading to the same chapter ending as when it went off just to keep the cliffhanger...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and it's destroyed by the Dragon Slayers' long-lost parents just as it goes off</span>. The second is the way the chapters juggled through several concurrent fights, often without significant progression in all but one that the chapter would end on.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, the Alvarez Empire arc, lasted 107 chapters in all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">M&Auml;R</a></em>, the anime version has this problem not because of the length of the filler arcs per se, but because they threw so many at the most incorrect moments. It goes like this; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Snow is captured near the end of Round 6, Ginta wants to rescue her but first must fight Ian, okay fair enough. THEN they prepare to leave but Phantom shows up and says they need to do the final round first. Okay, fine, so they go through the Gate of Training, which turns into a filler arc about the cast being sent to a illusion of Tokyo created from Ginta's memories, THEN they get back and some minor villains from way back when are causing trouble so they have to deal with that, THEN the final round starts and goes on for awhile, then once Phantom is beaten, they need a special &Auml;RM to get them to the castle to rescue Snow, which leads to a filler episode about hunting down the Referee of the tournament, then two more episodes about fixing Babbo who broke in the battle against Phantom and THEN one more episode about Ian for no reason. The ultimate irony is it only actually takes them 1 episode to rescue Snow. But due to so much unnecessary filler padding, it goes on forever. Snow is captured in Episode 58 and not rescued until freaking Episode 84!</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has usually been good with preventing arcs from lasting too long, but...
<ul><li> Even if some arcs kind of dragged out, none were able to reach the level of hair-tearing stalemate of the World War Arc - which took nearly three years to tell the story of a day and a half, where two of those years were spent telling the story of a single battle which was presumably a few hours long. The first part is problematic enough, but the real nugget is that last battle, and particularly its pacing. The entirety of it is a tug-of-war marathon, with each side countering the other side with increasingly effective techniques that have very few lasting consequences. The villain takes forever to finally go through all their gambits, absolute defenses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">psychological warfare tracts</a>, tragic flashbacks and final forms, and when they do - which would usually mark the end of the battle in any sane universe - the battle segues into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two more battles of this exact same kind, back to back, with absolutely no letup and plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retcons</a> about how everything has gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan">All According to Plan</a> for various people, one of whom we didn't even know existed until three chapters before</span>. When the manga finally emerges, wheezing, at the other end of this ordeal - all the villains are dead, everyone's exhausted and all the loose ends seem to be wrapped up - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasuke promptly declares his intent to take over the world in order to reform the shinobi system, <em>finally</em> triggering the long-awaited final battle between him and Naruto</span>. Oh, and to top it off, the anime has been inserting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> left, right, and center in the absolute worst spots in the plot in order to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a> flowing.
</li><li> The anime has the Three-Tails filler arc. It contains some ideas that would make for an interesting three or four episodes but instead goes on for an exasperating 23 episodes.
</li><li> The original anime had the lengthy Filler-arc, which is technically dozens of small filler arcs and episodes right after each other. Now, a few filler episodes here and there doesn't hurt. But when the last 80+ episodes in the series are all Filler... It starts to get a bit jarring. Even the final arc, which ends with Naruto and Jiraiya leaving to train isn't even canon, but it does set things up for his return in the first episode of Shippuuden.

Thankfully, the introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lucemon</a> ended this pattern.

The problems began later on.
<ul><li> The <em>Campagnia Ship Arc</em> was long, although it did reveal some twists, important characters and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">development</a> and began a potential long-running background plot, so the length could be excused.
</li><li> The <em>Weston College Arc</em> was the beginning of a downfall. The arc was long and took place in a school, bringing a lot of boring chores that generally were not found in the manga before, and involved a sub-plot to reveal a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> which many fans think could've been cut without impacting the important mission Ciel had been given upon infiltrating the school. The kicker came when the mission was stalled to involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> in the middle of it - once again, it was necessary to advance the plot, but prolonged the arc to the point of the reader getting exhausted.
</li><li> The <em>Werewolf Arc</em> in Germany is a mixture. The arc took around 20 chapters to complete, which sounds like very little, but was longer than the previous arcs and several chapters felt like nothing was going anywhere.
</li><li> The currently on-going <em>Blue Cult</em> arc. Ciel infiltrated originally because Lizzie had gone missing, and it involved some wackiness in the sense that the P4 from the Weston arc are now an idol group, but with sinister on-goings behind the titular cult's original means. Ciel creates a rival idol group called the Phantom 5 to expose the cult more, then the arc has begun to divert into a different plot-thread, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of Agni</span> and the revelation of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the 'true' Ciel Phantomhive returning, revealing that the 'Ciel' we've been following is his twinbrother, having taken the name and identity of Ciel</span>. After the latest revelation, the arc has devolved into multiple Flashback chapters detailing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the twins' life and</span> how the events of the ritual that summoned Sebastian came into being. Interesting, but definitely feeling like a big side-track.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Fall Classic" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em> lasted for more than 50 chapters, with the preliminaries spending 10 chapters or so to highlight the dishes made by numerous side characters (whom very few readers care about) and its subsequent judging. The main tournament itself contains 7 individual matches, each spanning at least five chapters, that by the time the finals come around, most readers have gotten tired of it and wants the plot to move on already.
<ul><li> Surpassing the "Fall Classic" arc is the Central saga which lasted for 131 chapters, two and a half years in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</li><li> The final Les Cuisinier Noir/BLUE Tournament Arc was 51 chapters long. As the plot progressed, the author began to skip too many rounds and the main Soma vs Asahi round was needlessly increased to 8 chapters. Rather than focusing on the cooking, the Arc is mostly dedicated towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Asahi's</a> antics and Erina's parental issues.

A single game lasting a single night has been in the making for a total of <strong>18 years</strong> now. The last round of the last match <em>alone</em> has taken a whole year to write so far, with one issue coming out every month. They take seven months just to draw all the tiles to start the round.
</li><li> <em>Marvel Anime: Wolverine</em>:
<ul><li> The series is only 12 episodes long; one entire episode is <em>just</em> Wolverine fighting Omega Red; the fight spills over into the start of the next episode; and Omega Red <em>still</em> comes back at the end of that next episode.
</li><li> The entire second half of the series is built around Wolverine going to the island of Madipoor, where the Big Bad has set up his base. There's a full three episodes (that's <em>a quarter of the entire series</em>) between Wolverine arriving on Madripoor and actually going to fight the Big Bad. These episodes were spent building dull and completely irrelevant characters, side-plots that are uninteresting and have little payoff, and a filler episode where Wolverine has to rescue Yukio.
</li><li> <em>Wolverine</em> wasn't the only <em>Marvel Anime</em> series to suffer from this: the <em>X-Men</em> series completely switches plot lines halfway through the series, so a good 3 or so straight episodes are just <em>solid exposition</em> while nothing really happens. Again: 12 episodes <em>total</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em>: The <em>Golem arc</em> is known for being a very slogging read to get through since a good chuck of it is focused on Jaco's past, his being killed, the fight with the berserk golem and and finally Jaco coming back to finish the battle with his newfound power. Did not help that this was meant to be in between a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>
<ul><li> The final battle against Hao in the manga likewise wound up being this since it had the character being forced to fight the Patch Tribe before finally reaching him. Not helped at all that the manga had been cancelled before the group could finally reach him. The pacing did get a tad better once it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em> has the Dream Ranker arc. The first half consists of two mini-arcs and bits of filler that have barely anything to do with the main plot of the arc. In fact, the actual plot doesn't really start until the arc's halfway point.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a> was originally supposed to be a six-month arc, but after initial sales were good, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Marvel's Marketing Department</a> forcefully stretched out the story by <em>nearly three years.</em>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> arc lasted nearly fifty issues, or a year and a half in real time. By the end, even people who had liked the premise were pretty tired of Spider-Man acting like a jerk and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">normally competent characters completely failing to notice Spidey was acting nothing like himself</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">possessed</a> by Dr. Octopus</span>.
</li><li> And before all of them, there was the original Hobgoblin mystery, which suffered from endless fake-outs as well as changing writers with differing ideas about who should be under the mask until the readers and creators just wanted it to be over. Eventually, having killed off their only viable suspect, the creators revealed that it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the dead guy after all</span>. And then almost twenty years later a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> by the original writer resolved the whole thing rather more satisfactorily.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Thy Kingdom Come" arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a></em>. It's actually a rather well-written arc, but it's pretty padded out (the three specials towards the end could have easily been worked into the main issues). It took up almost all of (if not every) 2008 issue of the title.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a>, Dark Reign, Dark Reign! Hope you liked the patently ludicrous idea of America willingly giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> complete control, because <em>every</em> issue of <em>every</em> Marvel book in 2009 dealt with nothing but how Norman Osborn controls the world.
</li><li> There has been a couple of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> A plot of Tails being the Ancient Walker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> was hinted at in the comic's early days, and then continued to drag on for years on end, with most stuff pretating to it merely being teased or hinted at. When the story was finally the focus of the 150th issue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Milestone Celebration</a>, the result (Tails joining forces with his counterparts from parallel universes to fight Mammouth Mogul) might have sounded cool on paper, but in execution it turned into one of the comics most infamous examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a>, and was considered, at best, a underwhelming climax for a story that being moving in slow motion for so long. There was hinted that would be even more to the storyline, but when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFlynn">Ian Flynn</a> shortly thereafter took over as headwriter for the comic, he ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeRoomForTheNewPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeRoomForTheNewPlot">putting an effective stop it</a> as a part of his extensive rework of the comic.
</li><li> The "Iron Dominion" arc. A saga that lasted well over a year, encompassing <em>17</em> issues, and left even die hard fans of the series and its writer screaming for it to end. Why? Two things are universal: it suffered from a grievous overabundance of pacing issues and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Backs</a>, mostly through the heroes and villain taking turns holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>.
</li><li> There's also the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">Mecha</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Sally</a> Arc", which also encompassed 17 issues and last well over a year. Tragic thing, though, is that the Arc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">didn't get to actually end</a> due to the book going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">major lawsuit that ultimately ended in a rather complicated settlement</a>, forcing the comic to instigate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">continuity reboot</a> right when Mecha Sally finally got captured by the heroes.
</li><li> Although the clear winner for this trope in Archie Sonic is the Shattered World Crisis, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay">incredibly loose adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em> that officially began in Issue 257 and then ended after <em>30 issues</em>, taking up three entire years of the comic! Although this can be somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as the whole arc was meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> for smaller stories that would provide quick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> for the comic after the forced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">reboot</a> erased the then established world building. And things probably wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsUnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsUnite">World's Unite</a> interrupting the story and Archie Comics delaying the release for the book for the entire winter of 2016, making the arc last even longer than it should've.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewKrypton">New Krypton</a></em> arc in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> titles unfortunately went down this path. The introduction of a wholly new population of Kryptonians was a strong and daring idea. The entire status quo of the Superman family was reworked and people were pleasantly surprised that writers had actually done something with the eternal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> that was the Bottle City of Kandor. But at some point along the way, it became apparent that the story was not going anywhere, that the entire World of New Krypton title was in a holding pattern while the associated titles (Superman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, later Adventure Comics) were engaged in crossover storylines. In the end, most of the arc served as setup for successive event stories.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> was killed off because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois and Clark: The New Adventures Of Superman</a></em> was in production and the executives wanted to have them marry at the same time in both media leading to a stalled marriage arc. This led to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death of Superman</a></em> which, if you include the return, ran over a year generating huge sales and leading the writers to run long event arcs for the remainder of the decade at which point the fans were finally tired of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>
<ul><li> Many of the X-Men's outer space stories feel like this, since they're always a departure from the book's mutant theme and are almost always economy-sized story arcs.
</li><li> Many fans were hoping the <em>Phoenix: Endsong</em> miniseries would be the last Phoenix story after writers ran the concept into the ground. It wasn't.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> arcs tend to get accused of suffering from this due to Bendis' ridiculously slow pacing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansHunt">Titans Hunt</a></em> was a complex and long story. It began with their members being kidnapped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> hired to rescue them. Then we get a new villain society, a cheap Wolverine expy, a flying sheet, an unneeded trip to Russia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a> turned into a complete robot, a new team of Titans from the future trying to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Troia</a>, and so on, and so on&#133;
</li><li> <em>The Culling</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em>. The first eight issues (most of a year) were built to get to this crossover with Legion Lost, and at the end they don't even manage to defeat the bad guy.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Back From The Dead" arc from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XStatix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XStatix">X-Statix</a></em>, in which a generic celebrity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive meddled</a> from the planned Princess Diana) suddenly returns from the dead and, for no clear reason, takes over the team and forces them to do charity work, dragged on for months thanks to Marvel's Executive Meddling, and it seemed increasingly evident that Peter Milligan had no idea where to go with it. It almost singlehandedly killed the series (the move to the Marvel Knights line and the lackluster subsequent crossover with the Avengers finished the job.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ForeverEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ForeverEvil">Forever Evil</a></em> ended up falling into this. The main reason was that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TrinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TrinityWar">Trinity War</a></em>, an event DC had been shilling for over a year, turned out to merely be a lead-in to Forever Evil. Add in a generally sluggish pace magnified by the main series being delayed - the 7th issue came three months after the 6th - and you've got readers making a <em>lot</em> of jokes about the title.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> story arc <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em> (including its two "sequels", <em>KnightQuest</em> and <em>KnightsEnd</em>) dragged on for about a year and a half - and that's not even counting the buildup that began months before the arc took off, with plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early Bird Cameos</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhovs Guns</a>... <em>or</em> the aftermath of the arc focusing on Dick Grayson, since it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">wrapped up with quite a few loose ends</a>, some of which were not tied up until a year later or even after. The story was also told across several comic-book titles, some of which began publication just to tie in with the arc. All told, the <em>Knightfall</em> saga cast its shadow over the <em>Batman</em> mythos from 1992 to 1996 and encompassed more than 200 individual comics. Worst of all, untold numbers of fans <em>hated</em> it.
<ul><li> This is the biggest criticism of Tom King's <em>Batman</em> run in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanRebirth">Batman (Rebirth)</a></em>. First, there was "The Wedding" arc focusing on the developing relationship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">and then wedding,</a> between Batman and Catwoman. It lasted for fifty issues, incorporating multiple smaller arcs on the way, before finally ending with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Catwoman abandoning Batman at the altar and the status quo being restored.</span> Next up came "Knightmares", an arc where Batman lies in a machine hallucinating his worst fears one at a time, which went on for several months of real-world time, and then finally came "City of Bane", where whole issues were spent with Batman and Catwoman working out their relationship on a beach, as opposed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">fairly urgent main plot</a> (Bane taking over Gotham City and controlling an army of villains).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingForTheTrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingForTheTrade">decompressed style of storytelling</a> tends to turn <em>any</em> arc into this, primarily because it involves a lot of issues where... nothing happens, only to be resolved suddenly in the last issue. The end result is readers screaming "Get on with it!" even for relatively brief six-issue arcs:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UncannyXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UncannyXMen">The Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier</a>, which is tied in to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OriginalSin">Original Sin</a> event, has not only run longer than the event itself, but has <em>also</em> overrun both the Death of Wolverine <em>and</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AXIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AXIS">AXIS</a></em>, though it seems to finally have an end... just before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015">Secret Wars (2015)</a></em>.
</li><li> The crossover between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AllNewXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AllNewXMen">All-New X-Men</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> is also exasperating fans with the fact that <em>very</em> little has been done to advance the plot after four issues, and not helped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a> of a missed shipping date.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a></em> has had brushes with this on a few occasions:
<ul><li> The <em>Elegant Chaos</em> arc dragged a bit, not due to length or quality issues (it's only three issues long and has a lot of plot-important events) but because unexpected problems IDW encountered that resulted in issues suffering delays. This meant that there were <em>massive</em> gaps between issues and the plot-heavy nature of the arc meant that nothing could be skipped.
</li><li> The Scavenger plotline sometimes gets this. The problem being that there are fairly large gaps between the Scavenger focused arcs, so events and plot points set-up for them don't get paid off until about ten issues or so later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersDarkCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersDarkCybertron">The Transformers: Dark Cybertron</a></em> crossover event wasn't this for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersRobotsInDisguise">The Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em> but it <em>did</em> cause fatigue for MTMTE. Whereas the crossover wrapped up a bunch of plotlines for RID, the events and characters in MTMTE didn't really have any link to the crossover's driving force. Thus the crossover was essentially a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDetour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotDetour">Plot Detour</a> that just created a huge wait between seasons 1 and 2 of MTMTE. By the end, the only things the crossover accomplished for MTMTE was the introduction of several important characters, only two of whom couldn't have just been introduced in a normal MTMTE arc.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nexus Prime storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersTimelines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersTimelines">Transformers: Timelines</a></em> took a total of <em>nine years</em> to finish, thanks in no small part to Hasbro taking custody on the Thirteen for their future plans with the franchise, forcing Nexus Prime to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity">Exiled from Continuity</a> for five years straight. This was eventually concluded with another arc that suffered this, the plot of <em>Invasion</em>, the comic story released in 2012 that saw <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Classics universe being destroyed and its characters ending up in Shattered Glass</span>, that didn't see proper continuation for a good three years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogIDW">Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW)</a></em>'s lead writer Ian Flynn freely admits to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingForTheTrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingForTheTrade">Writing for the Trade</a>, so some of this may have been inevitable. While the first arc more or less avoided this, the following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticization">Metal Virus</a> storyline dragged on for over a year... which may not have been so bad if said arc didn't mostly involve the heroes constantly losing everything they have, lovable characters turning, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">horrifically broken</a>, or otherwise suffering, and the villains being borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">invincible</a>. It veered uncomfortably close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a> for some, and even fans who enjoyed the drama admitted it was starting to wear out its welcome after about eight full issues of it. The fact that the last few issues of the arc were subjected to mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a> due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic didn&#146;t help matters. By the time the arc finally came to an end in late September 2020, it had lasted <em>21 issues</em> (13-32 plus the 2020 annual)... nearly 2/3rds of the entire comic&#146;s run up to that point!

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackMagicianTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackMagicianTrilogy">The Black Magician</a> series seems to have a problem with this, particularly in the second book, Novice. Most of the over 500 pages consists of a bog standard bullying story. The overarching plot only makes an appearance halfway through, and then only in the form of a hostage situation that remains at a perfect standstill both when it comes to understanding motivations and resolving the situation until the epilogue. By contrast, there is another subplot in Novice that consists of a scavenger hunt across the world, a budding romance and a major character development and exploration of the character and the politics of the world that is given 50 or so pages to develop, flashing by on one or a couple of pages in between dozens of pages of yet more bullying and blackmail.

Partly because they couldn't decide on what power Hollyleaf would have by the time they were <em>halfway through</em> the six-book Power of Three series, and then Vicky finally got the idea that maybe Hollyleaf isn't actually one of the Three, and the story arc got dragged on to fill the fourth series, <em>Omen of the Stars</em>, as well. The purpose of the Three is that they all have special powers that will help them defeat the Dark Forest when they invade the Clans; this wasn't even hinted at until partway through <em>Omen of the Stars</em>. Instead, the two series were mostly filled with short filler conflicts, and there was no real villain throughout all of <em>Power of Three</em>.

Sometimes two thirds of a comic retell the contents of a previous comic with one new panel. One day of Dick Tracy's life takes several months of comic strips. Of course, this was sometimes the fault of the fans, who occasionally enjoyed a story so much they demanded it be continued after it had decisively ended, often requiring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> or two (for example, Flattop, the most popular villain of the series' history, was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">brought back from the dead</a> so that he could be killed <em>again</em>).

The strip got to spend almost a year telling the same WWII story, only from <em>Bill</em>'s point-of-view. This has also included several months of Bill and Martine (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">French Resistance member</a>) idly strolling though Normandy during the middle of D-Day.

The boy (named Skeezix) grew to manhood without ever learning who his parents were. About 80 years later, with <em>Gasoline Alley</em> still running, and with Skeezix Wallet now well into his eighties, the strip's latest artist/writer finally decided to reveal who Skeezix's parents were.

The comics themselves don't seem capable of keeping track either. For one example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/JudgeParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/JudgeParker">Judge Parker</a>,</em> while in the real world, it had been several years since Neddie went off to school in France, the comic internally moved ahead roughly a month of time. Yet when Neddie returned in mid-2010, the characters acted as if she'd actually been gone a significant period of time. <em>Rex Morgan</em>, meanwhile, spent the better part of a year on a <em>weekend</em> cruise.

Not as big as some of these other examples, but when you realize that it's a humor strip, unlike most of the strips mentioned here, which are serious strips...
</li><li> Parodied when the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> strips were used during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em>.

</li><li> The latter part of the fifth season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">WWE NXT</a> became this after months without an elimination. Then, they dropped all pretense of it still being a contest and it became a C-show with their lower midcarders. When season 5 of NXT finally ended, it had aired 67 episodes.

The feud itself never quite connected with the audience as being anything legitimately special, despite WWE's attempts to portray it as being one of the greatest rivalries in not just WWE itself, but in all of sports. Fans are so sick of it that around 2014, Cena/Orton matches began being received by live crowds with anything ranging from silent apathy to outright hostility.
</li><li> The "Anonymous GM" of Raw was either this or a Myth Stall (since it was supposed to be the overarching essence of Raw itself), or something altogether different (since WWE made no effort to explore the identity of this GM, meaning it wasn't even a storyline).

The initial concept seemed somewhat meaningless towards the end, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> were feuding with each other, all of whom were with the WWE at the start of the arc.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>'s monster masked wrestler Abyss, portrayed by Chris Parks, was attacked after a match in January 2012 and disappeared from the show. In March his identically-built brother Joseph Park showed up on the show looking for him. Joseph's search for his brother and supposed legal training allowed him to get involved in a few storylines and he eventually went to wrestling school and was able to compete in matches (albeit poorly due to his mild manner and lack of experience). However, after suffering enough punishment or getting cut open he would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Hulk out</a> and/or perform his brother's finishing move.

Not only had all but the dimmest viewers known or at least suspected this for months but it effectively meant that Chris Parks had been forced to wrestle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">badly</a> for an extended period of time for a character whose potential would never be maximized. It didn't help that it was a combination of Kaz, Daniels and Eric Young who worked out the secret since they were not exactly portrayed as the brightest members of the roster.
</li><li> Some people feel that the 2013-14 WWE "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>" storyline went on far longer than it should have. In short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> wins the WWE title at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a>, gets Pedigreed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> and cashed in on by Randy Orton and screwed out of the title, and the screwjobs continued for months afterward, as Triple H, Orton, and Stephanie McMahon (and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a>) spend months bullying and beating Bryan, getting no lasting repercussions for their actions in the process. It wasn't helped by random detours in the plot, such as Bryan feuding with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily">The Wyatt Family</a> for a few months for no particular reason, especially since Bryan ended up <em>losing</em> the payoff match to that feud, and that doesn't even touch on the inexplicable, two-week period where Bryan suddenly turned heel and joined the Wyatts. (the idea was actually to write Bryan out of the Authority angle, meaning he'd get no payoff twice over but he remained too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">popular for that to be feasible</a>) Eventually, though, Bryan would win the title back at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a>, overcoming Triple H, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>, and Orton (Though that was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> following the overwhelming negative fan reaction to Batista winning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> a few months prior). <br><br>In a related case, many people feel the entire concept of the Authority had run its course a long time ago, but the stable/angle kept getting extended whenever it looked like it was about to finally come to a close. Daniel Bryan beating Evolution and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> soundly squashing Kane and the New Age Outlaws at <em>Wrestlemania 30</em> end up meaning nothing, because they just switch opponents and send Evolution after the Shield and Kane after Bryan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> makes his WWE debut to help Team Cena beat Team Authority at <em>Survivor Series 2014</em>, with the explicit stipulation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a> would be ousted from power if they lost; never mind, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> forces Cena to reinstate them a few weeks later, setting the entire thing back to square one. Sting and Triple H face off at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 31</em> with the implication the Authority would take a huge hit if Sting won? Never mind, it became a nostalgia segment and Sting lost anyway. The angle didn't end until <em>one year later</em>, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> defeated Triple H at <em>WrestleMania 32</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee">AJ Lee</a>'s feud in the summer of 2014, particularly after Paige won the title back at <em>SummerSlam</em>. It got to the point where the feud had originally featured sneak attacks and intense promos - and ended up with random segments where AJ walked out on her tag partners and the two only exchanged stern looks - despite supposedly hating each other's guts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla">Layla</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerRae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerRae">Summer Rae</a>'s storyline was heading in this direction when they decided to team up and make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fandango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Fandango">Fandango</a>'s life hell. For four weeks they just appeared at ringside to interfere in his matches - and it was obvious there would be no pay-off match since it's a women vs man feud. Thankfully it actually was ended pretty quickly and the two were integrated into the women's division as a tag team.
</li><li> Much in the vein of the Cena/Orton feud, fans got sick of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels">Christopher Daniels</a> feud <em>years</em> ago. While the matches were amazing, the feud always had Chris as the heel and his turn always happened for the same damn reason. It eventually culminated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> that was Claire Lynch, which would win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap">Gooker Award</a> for 2012. Thankfully, that was the final run of the feud in TNA, and most agree that if anything, they at least got Bad Influence out of it.
</li><li> Played with in the case of the feud between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a>. The feud, overall, ran for <strong>26 months</strong>, beginning with the Rock's return in February 2011 and ending at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 29</em> in April 2013. However, despite that incredibly long run-time, the Rock spent the majority of this time away from the show, leaving Cena to do other things until it was time to resume their feud. It still stands for the most part, however, since most fans felt it at least should have ended with their "Once in a Lifetime" match at <em>WrestleMania 28</em> instead of reviving the angle just to give Cena his win back.
</li><li> The love trapezoid angle in 2015 between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana">Rusev and Lana</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerRae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerRae">Summer Rae</a> went on for an unreasonably long time and seemed to get the heel/face dynamic backwards. Ziggler came off as a thorough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a> who acted like a smug prick about Lana leaving Rusev for him and taunting him over it every chance he got. Rusev, on the other hand, was seen as the most sympathetic party in the story despite WWE's attempts to portray him as some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuser</a>, since he lost his undefeated streak and United States Championship to John Cena, was sidelined with an ankle injury, and then his girlfriend leaves him for a guy that actively devotes time to mocking him about it, he came off as a legitimately broken man and fans saw his hatred toward Ziggler as being completely justified. The seeds of a Rusev and Lana breakup were planted as early as March and didn't "resolve" for at least another <em>six months</em>. Part of the problem was that the storyline hit several nasty snags along the way, like Rusev and Lana each being injured at different points and Ziggler taking time off to film a movie, but rather than just scrap the storyline, since it wasn't really all that popular with the crowd, they kept stalling and extending it until the missing party returned. Rusev and Lana's involvement didn't end until Lana posted photos of herself wearing an engagement ring from her real life engagement to Rusev, at which point WWE effectively let them bail on the angle, and even then they extended and rewrote the angle to be Ziggler and the debuting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TylerBreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TylerBreeze">Tyler Breeze</a> feuding over Summer Rae.
</li><li> The feud between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Charlotte">Charlotte</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a> has been received this way by plenty of people. While neither of them are bad, WWE decided that what they needed to give the new-look Women's Division and new Women's Championship legitimacy was to have a long, great rivalry. Unfortunately, they went about it in a very forced and hamfisted way that only made many fans sick of the angle, with many directly comparing it to a compressed version of the Cena/Orton rivalry above. All-in-all, the angle lasted (with a bit of on-and-off here and there) somewhere in the ballpark of <em>16 months</em>, featured many "first time ever" matches like the first women's Hell in a Cell match for no real reason aside being able to promote it was the first time ever, and worst of all, featured the new Women's Title hot-potatoeing back and forth between the two so often that they each racked up a number of title reigns in this span of a little more than a year that even many legitimately legendary wrestlers never touch in their entire careers ironically did much more to hamper the title's legitimacy than it did to build it, as well as the fact that the feud was so prominent for so long that it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a>, all of the other women on the show were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>, and ironically did more harm than good to the division as a whole. The fact that the feud was mostly one-sided in Charlotte's favor, with most of the hot-potatoeing being Sasha winning the title and then almost immediately losing it back to Charlotte, also did the new title no favors.
<ul><li> Really, Charlotte holds a title for so long and so many times, it's rare to even see her not carrying gold. By her seventh championship win, she begin to receive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">X-Pac Heat</a> after pinning Becky Lynch during a triple threat match at <em>SummerSlam</em> 2018, which also involved defending champion Carmella. The match was initially supposed to be only between Becky and Carmella after two months of buildup in Becky's favor, but Charlotte immediately returned to the title spot after a two month absence, ruining all of Becky's potential and rendering her efforts a waste. It wasn't a surprise when Becky turned heel on her, with Charlotte the one who received boos from the fans.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>'s first Universal Championship reign, far more than any other reign in recent memory. Initially his reign started out well when he defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a> for the title at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 33</em> &mdash; who the fans soured on after he defeated the previous champion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Owens</a>, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashMatch">Squash Match</a>. By the end of 2017, however, fans were bitterly reminded of why they disliked having a part-timer as champion, as Lesnar barely showed up outside of the occasional title defense, to the point that many even forgot that RAW had a world title, with some even considering the Intercontinental Championship the top title on RAW. It had reached a point where many were actually happy at the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> winning at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 34</em>, as it meant they'd have a full-time champion again, and Reigns was far more likely to lose the title in a smaller time frame. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Except he didn't win</a>. And then he didn't win his next title match at <em>The Greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a></em> in Saudi Arabia. In fact, Reigns didn't win the title from Lesnar until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> 2018</em>, at which point Lesnar's reign had surpassed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>'s historic 434-day reign by <strong>two and a half months</strong>. By that point, not only had Lesnar's reign entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a>, but so did his feud with Reigns; when Reigns finally won the title, the fans actually <em>cheered</em> for it because they figured that would be the end of it all, since Reigns defeating Lesnar for the title had been goal since at least 2015. Unfortunately, two months after that, Reigns had to relinquish the title and go on hiatus from wrestling to start treatment for his leukemia, which had returned. His next title defense, a triple threat with Lesnar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BraunStrowman">Braun Strowman</a>, became a one-on-one match for the vacated title...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">which Lesnar won</a>.

Many consider it the most boring part of the game, as the normally fun and energizing boss fights feel like a chore. Up until the last "cycle", that is, when all of the job holders start teaming up in unique themed groups and some story actually begins to wrap up.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">Clear Bow's name</a>" plot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireII">Breath of Fire II</a></em>. After Bow gets accused of theft and is forced into hiding, the game's main plot has several other key events happen during that time, making it feel like Bow's subplot should have been resolved ages ago to get to other matters. But it just keeps going. And with Bow out of the party, Ryu has to pick up the slack, fighting for a not-insignificant amount of time all by himself. By the time the party finds the real thief in SimaFort, not only will a player likely be distracted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">cockroach cooking contest</a>, but they might not realize their quarry is even there.

</li><li> In a case of this happening within a single game's storyline, the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> had a rule that trials could last a maximum of three days. Doesn't sound like much, but when you had to go through three investigation segments and three trial segments for every case, it ended up stretching a lot of cases out. Consequently, though the three-day limit is still a thing, every following game has used two-day trials.

<ul><li> After an optional quest to grab the Horadric Malus for the town blacksmith in the monastery barracks, the only objective left in Act I is to kill Andariel. However, the distance you have to cover in order to reach Andariel can be quite tedious for some people. From the barracks, the journey to her has the player going through three levels of a prison, to the cathedral, and capping off with four levels of catacombs.
</li><li> Traversing the early jungle portions of Act 3 (the spider forest, the great marsh, and the flayer jungle) is met with a similar criticism due to the lengths of having to run around searching for the two dungeons that have the body parts needed for a main quest.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has four major quests which must be finished in order to get to the final part of the game. However, one of these quests - "A Paragon of Her Kind" - is practically big enough for a DLC campaign, being larger than the other three put together. There are roughly six dungeons which <em>have</em> to be completely explored (and more in optional sidequests); there's never a chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, even if both of the options are stupid or out-of-character for the player; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the good ending comes out of siding with the corrupt jerkass between the two potential kings, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>'s conservative ways cause a violent revolt after the events of the game</span>; the player has to do quite a bit of running back and forth between the dwarven capital and the aforementioned dungeons; and several of the characters introduced are quite simply unlikable.
<ul><li> The Mage's Circle quest also has plenty of this due to a moment in the middle of the quest, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a sloth demon sends you into the Fade (the place where a person's consciousness goes while they're asleep)</span>. The segment which follows is long, unskippable, boring, and difficult. A very popular mod for the game has no other use but simply jump that segment and get you back to the normal quest; however, this is only available to PC players. If you're on console, you have no choice but to do the whole thing.
</li></ul></li><li> Much of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII">Dragon Quest VII</a></em> is spent saving helpless villagers from monsters and finding puzzle pieces to unlock a portal to another village where you do exactly the same thing, over and over. By the time you liberate the winged people (the last instance of this before the <em>real</em> plot begins), you'll have clocked in at 80 hours if you're not trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">grind jobs</a> during that time. Even though the 3DS version toned this down (especially the beginning), the fact that the bulk of the game is essentially a series of vignettes where you go back and forth can still feel offputting to some fans of other games where the plot moves quicker. To put it into perspective, in most games, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a> is fought around 5-15 hours in, whereas the 3DS version of <em>VII</em> will still take around 30-40.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has suffered from this twice.
<ul><li> The first and most prominent case is the "Seventh Astral Era" quest chain, AKA the quests added after the original release of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> but before its first expansion <em>Heavensward</em>, especially once the latter was released. Many complained about the need to actually reach the expansion content to play as its new classes for the primary reason that the Seventh Astral Era segment stretches on for a solid <em>hundred</em> quests, more than half as long as the Level 1 to 50 questline went &mdash; even <em>Heavensward</em>'s initial line of level 50 to 60 quests is shorter than that.
</li><li> Even though Patch 5.3 streamlined the Seventh Astral Era to make it more approachable for new players, it <em>still</em> goes on for a while. Instead of a hundred quests, it was reduced by <em>twenty</em>. But since you <em>still</em> need to complete the Crystal Tower questline (10 quests), as well as three hardmode versions of primals you fought, you're now looking at a total of <em>ninety three quests</em>.
</li><li> <em>Stormblood</em> suffers from this in its Ala Mhigo arc, in that it's almost treated as an afterthought despite events in Ala Mhigo being the catalyst for the expansion's story arc. Its problem is twofold: one, it decided to also deal with liberating a second country from Garlean occupation (the in-universe logic being to divide the Garleans' attention by forcing them to deal with two rebellions at the same time), and two, that second country ended up with far more time spent on it - keeping in mind that you have to be at level 60 to start the <em>Stormblood</em> story, you head for the Far East at level 61 and don't come back until you've liberated Doma at level <em>68</em>, which leaves almost no room for Ala Mhigo to have any real story. What makes this even worse is that Lyse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">gets much more story importance</a> with this expansion, but her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> is almost entirely tied to Ala Mhigo rather than Doma - which means she spends almost 90% of the expansion never progressing past the "Lyse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">whines about feeling useless</a>" phase of her development before very suddenly jumping to "Lyse is leading the Ala Mhigan Resistance", without even giving her any chance to prove herself worthy of the role until well <em>after</em> she's been thrust into it.

Due to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">huge</a></em> cast, constant flashbacks/backstories, and that the game just kept adding more and more heroes before fully fleshing out the existing ones, the narrative is always in a state of introducing plot threads and leaving them hanging to introduce another one, likely to be just as neglected. This has had the effect of making the story so far feel more like a prolonged opening act.

On top of the only rewards being cryptic hints which lead to more cryptic hints, it was remarkably spaced out, including having a countdown on a mysterious website in the form of a percentage ticking up 0.0038% every three minutes, which months later only revealed... more cryptic hints.

These were actually the first stories written when the writers thought that each world should have five books.

<ul><li> The <em>Hivebent</em> arc got some flak for taking too long, especially since the End of Act 4 immediately before it ended on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a> with the kids. Then Act 5 Act 2 began and showed no signs of stopping, to the point where by the end Act 5 as a whole was longer than the first four acts combined. It grew so long that it may have inspired the "damaged disc" arc where Terezi accidentally scratches Homestuck Disc 2, prompting Doc Scratch to narrate the story while the disc is repaired. At first Scratch says his narration will be abbreviated, but a <strong>long</strong> time (just over three months) later, Hussie himself is so fed up that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">breaks through the "fifth wall"</a> and attacks Scratch with a broom to put a stop to his "condescending self indulgent narrative style". Finding that the disc had been repaired for quite some time, Hussie comes to the conclusion that Scratch "likes the sound of his own voice."

</li><li> Act 6 is even worse, being longer than Act 5. To name a more specific example, it took the original main characters over a year's worth of updates to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get from their old session to the one of the newer characters</span>. As a whole, first 4 Acts take about 25% of pages, Act 5 26%, with Act 6 taking remaining 49%. Timewise, they take about 17%, 20% and 63%, respectively, of webcomic's lifetime.

<ul><li> The "Oceans Unmoving" arc attracted a lot of this sentiment, largely because it focused around a brand new cast, with most of the main characters stuck off-screen for months at a time.
</li><li> The "4U City" arcs did this as well, as Riff is the only major character present for them aside from all the alternate reality versions of other characters. The entire arc took place over several years, started and stopped randomly to return to the antics of Torg and Co. in the prime universe, and was particularly annoying since it not only kept Riff out of the main plotline for all this time, but also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> refused to resolve the dangling plot thread about Zoe's fate until the <em>last</em> panel of the <em>last</em> arc</span>.

Some liked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, especially for Justin, Susan, and Nanase, while others felt a year-long arc with few wacky antics and no action sequences was not what they signed up for.

It was then retroactively split into two acts of roughly equal strip numbers, but with Act 2 ending at the end of 2003 and Act 3 lasting from 2004 to 2009. As, with the exception of an early sideplot which was temporarily dropped (but resolved in Act 4 in early 2011) and a flashback or two, <em>all</em> of the action in the latter act happened in the same area, it could indeed be asked "Are they <em>still</em> in Nexus?" (And, if you're asking about the Gamemasta only, the answer, as of comic #786, is still "yes".)

</li><li> The Storm of Souls was also accused of this, but that was more forgivable since it was the culmination of everything that had come before.
</li></ul></li><li> The massive Castle Heterodyne arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, which have all been about Agatha trying to get into Castle Heterodyne to fix it, or Agatha trying to fix it, or other people trying to reach Agatha while she fixes it. Agatha entered the castle proper on February 8th, 2008, and didn't set foot outside again until November 2, 2011, three and a half years later.

</li><li> Then she spent over another year running around defending the castle, which was like the previous three years, but outdoors instead of indoors.
</li><li> <em>Girl Genius</em> has always been a slow moving comic with lots of detail and development, but just to put this in more perspective, the comic launched online April 18th, 2005, although the date given on the first comic is Nov 4th, 2002. Given the 2005 launch, more than half of the comic has been spent in the Castle. On top of that, the Foglios have said that everything before Volume Nine, which started in January 2009, is the first season of the comic.
</li></ul></li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic">Irregular Webcomic!</a></em>'s "fantasy" arc. They started the quest on 25th of June 2004, and finally finished on 31st August 2011 - seven years, two months and six days later. In a daily webcomic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins">Goblins</a></em>. The Brassmoon arc took two years and eleven months to complete, not counting Fumbles' arrival. Made worse by the fact that, as always with Thunt, the battle scenes go into completely unnecessary detail on the same one-three-pages-per-nineish-days schedule that everything else does.
<div class="indent"><strong>Forgath</strong>: Um, okay. I guess my first question would be, how did Brassmoon get a talking wall? <br><strong>Talking Wall</strong>: Oh geez, you don't want to know that. The answer is a story arc that goes on for, like, <em>ever</em>. Ask me something else.
</div></li><li> Bordering between this, Myth Fatigue, and likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">Ending Fatigue</a> is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em>'s final arc, which was getting really long if not drawn out before it spent several <em>months</em> on the Light Warriors' failed attempts to get strong enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeat Chaos</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime">in 24 hours</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, this turns out to have been <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction">completely</a></em> intentional, just for the sake of making the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a> that much bigger.</span>
</li><li> With almost a hundred pages coupled with sporadic updates, episode four of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheFan">The Fan</a></em> took almost two years to complete. In fact it was so long, that the the author had to part it halfway. Even he was glad when it finally ended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Collar6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Collar6">Collar 6</a></em>:
<ul><li> The initial story-arc took over a year to reach its climax (no, not that kind). This isn't really Myth Stall, since it hasn't fully developed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> yet. The stall did get better, however, when the update schedule moved from twice a week to three times a week. Furthermore, unlike many example of this trope, the author has been consistent in his updates.
</li><li> The second arc was even worse, beginning in March 2011 and lasting until February 2014 and that's with minimal slip and a further increase near the end to five days a week. It also had a lot of world building and new characters, which were handled in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">Info Dumps</a> that lasted up to a month at a time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ClanOfTheCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ClanOfTheCats">Clan of the Cats</a></em> beats all of the above by a long shot, with its "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainCharacter">Vengeance of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a>" arc, which started in August 2003 and is still going on, over 600 pages later (not counting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a>).

To Resist Ninja Drugs and Ninja Violence." By the end of the many connected horror storylines, even the authors admitted their plots were taking too long. After another extremely long plot wrapped, the comic barreled right into "Judie Gets A Kitten" - which ran for <em>one week</em>. Many fans have considered the shock brevity a slight jab at the complaints over this trope. The kitten arc was filler before a crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AxeCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AxeCop">Axe Cop</a></em>, and the ending was retconned.
</li><li> The muffin arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OriginalLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OriginalLife">Original Life</a></em> went on for almost half a year, which is a lot for a comic that doesn't usually go over three pages before moving on to a new topic. According to most fans, it long overstayed its welcome.
</li><li> Wonder Woman's birthday party story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JL8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JL8">JL8</a></em> started in November of 2012 (August if you count the buildup) and did not end until July of 2013. An infrequent update schedule was part of the problem, but what really dragged the story out was that it turned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> between Superman, Wonder Woman, and Power Girl into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins">Jack</a></em>: The second half of the "Megan's Run" arc alone is the longest arc the series ever had, but adding the two halves up, it comes to a whopping 257 pages. Adding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slips</a> to the mix, it felt like the arc would never end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ParadoxSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ParadoxSpace">Paradox Space</a></em> consists of several short and separate stories, but sometimes they are not short enough:
<ul><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.paradoxspace.com/pones/1">Pones<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SweetBroAndHellaJeff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SweetBroAndHellaJeff">Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff</a>, attracted this reaction despite only being 2 pages long (the comic gets one page every weekday). While SBaHJ's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a> humor is funny in smaller doses, getting two days of Sweet Bro playing with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePhony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePhony">My Little Pony</a> lookalike doll may have been too much.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.paradoxspace.com/night-at-the-100dseum/1">Night at the 100dseum<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> is ten pages long, which means that with one page per weekday, fans had nothing but Karkat and Terezi going through Equius' museum for two weeks straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.paradoxspace.com/the-thirst-of-dornamon-gary/1">The Thirst of Dornamon Gary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> is another <em>Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff</em>-themed comic, but, unlike <em>Pones</em>, which was two days, this one is a full five days long. At least the story is more interesting than just Sweet Bro playing with a toy unicorn.
</li><li> Among Paradox Space's longest stories were <a class="urllink" href="http://www.paradoxspace.com/secret-sufferer">Secret Sufferer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (25 pages long) and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.paradoxspace.com/the-inaugural-death-of-mister-seven">The Inaugural Death of Mister Seven<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (24 pages long). These stories, however, would have x2 Update Combos for a week, meaning that two pages would be done a day instead of one, so this took the sting out of it a little. However, not even this could alleviate how long <a class="urllink" href="http://www.paradoxspace.com/summerteen-romance">Summerteen Romance<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was. At over double the length of the aforementioned stories, at 51, even two updates a weekday for a week only just made a dent.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Spinnerette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Spinnerette">Spinnerette</a></em>, the Colonel Glass Saga fell victim to this. If you add in the delays and an interlude to preview the author's new book, the saga took <em>over a year</em> to complete in a series where the storyarcs normally last about a month or two. It didn't help that the arc was <em>extremely</em> dark for a comedic series; Colonel Glass, a sadistic North Korean operative with the power to <em>control shards of glass</em>, is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> on legs. As such, the arc was emotionally exhausting in addition to its length.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LsEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LsEmpire">L's Empire</a></em> has an in-universe example. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a> get bored with one of the story arcs so they just fast forward to the final battle. This comes back up as a minor plot point later on.
</li><li> The "Godsmoot/vampire Durkon" arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> lasted a while (beginning in earnest in March 2014 and climaxing on October 2018). A lot of fans expressed frustration at how long the comic was spending on a side story &mdash; until the arc concluded in a way that made it essential to the main story with a twist that no-one saw coming.
</li><li> This happens a bit with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Endtown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Endtown">Endtown</a></em>, as the arcs can go on for <em>a while</em>. The very first arc featured the epic quest with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelflessWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelflessWish">Selfless Wish</a>, complete with a backstory for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a>. Then the characters spend several months just getting back home and getting clearance. This isn't going onto the "Milk and Eggs" arc or the flashback arc...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StandStillStaySilent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StandStillStaySilent">Stand Still, Stay Silent</a></em> has always had a slow pace, but this effect got a little worse during the last chapter of the first major story arc, which consists of two of the characters trying to escape a large group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueZombie">Plague Zombie</a> monsters in circumstances that make exterior help extremely unlikely. The chapter's publication was happening in parallel with the production of artwork for the second major story arc, which showed the two characters alive and well, and reinforced the feeling they were taking a long time to either get rid of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueZombie">Plague Zombie</a> monsters and/or meet up with the rest of the cast.
</li><li> The fan-comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/AdventuresInLurning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/AdventuresInLurning">Adventures In Lurning</a></em> had the <em>Colin is Dead arc</em> that started on August 4th, 2017 and keep going until October 10th, 2018. Many fans felt like the Story Arc was going for to long for what was originally just a fun ask fan-blog; even the author admitted he was tired of the arc and renamed it in the Story Arc Guide as <em>Colin is Dead Arc - The Never-Ending Story Arc</em>. Thankfully, after the arc ended, the blog returned to its origins.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures">Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures</a>: The <em>Friends in High Places</em> chapter has been going on since 2013 with over 600 pages at the time of writing with no indication of stopping. It wouldn't be so bad if things had actually happened during those six years, but the majority of it has just consisted of build-up (the cubi clan meeting, Piflak's party, etc.) or exposition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DragonBallMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DragonBallMultiverse">Dragon Ball Multiverse</a> has the Budokai Royale/Majin Rebellion arc which started in 2017 and is still ongoing as of this writing.

The creators weren't pleased about that, however, and when it was coming to a close, made some clear hints that the end was indeed in sight. Due to production issues, episodes couldn't be aired one after another. Hiatuses had to be endured, stretching twenty-some episodes over several months rather than weeks. It wasn't helped by the absence of half the main cast during most of the arc.

Disney's DVDs arrange the episodes in production order. Because of this, the Avengers discover eight episodes in that an alien lives among them, and take another five to find out who exactly the alien replaced. The viewer doesn't get to see what happened to the victim until after they notice a member has been replaced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>
<ul><li> The yet-unresolved continuing grand scheme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">The Light</a> has become this in the second season. So the heroes foil the season-long plans of the Light - surprise, all that was only Phase 1! And some other fans were already thinking this during the first season. Most of the show has a problem with this, actually: there are so many intertwining plotlines going on at the same time, all of them saturated with characters that only seem to be there for the sake of having another new hero/villain, that you can easily get lost between everything or get sick of it. Made all the worse that, by the season finale of Season 2, it's obvious what The Light's plan was: 1) use the Justice League's attack on Rimbor to alert the universe and The Reach to the presence of Earth as a major world 2) use The Reach to instigate Mongul into bringing War World to Earth 3) Destroy The Reach's plans and give The Guardians a reason to try them for war crimes, in order to take them out of the picture 4) Use The War World around Rimbor to alert the rest of the universe that Earth is hereby off-limits 5) All this is in preparation for Darkseid (Wherever There is Light, There is Always a Darkseid) and the legions of Apokolips to invade Earth... Season 3 would have been Apokolips invading Earth. The show was canceled before this could possibly have become more complicated. It really doesn't help that, thanks to multiple hiatuses, the show spent more time off the air than on.
</li><li> When the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a>, the fatigue came back tenfold, and by the conclusion of season 3, very little progress is seemingly made on the overall series arc. Luthor loses his position as Secretary-General, but remains free and retains his position in the Light. Granny is being punished by Darkseid as a scapegoat, but will undoubtedly be free to continue as before. Despite everything that happened, the alliance between Darkseid and the Light remains firmly intact. There's talk of a great galactic war coming, but it's kept so vague that its near-impossible to guess what the threat could be. The conflict of this entire season can be considered just setup for the actual central conflict that may or may not finally happen in Season 4. Either way, the arc of the series is moving a lot more slowly than many had expected. Most took as practically given after the Season 2 stinger that Apokolips would invade Earth in Season 3, which doesn't happen. The Earth is arguably never under direct threat in Season 3, unless you count the very few minutes it appeared Granny had won.
</li><li> This can also apply to the many subplots started or continued in Season 3. Even more so than previous seasons, the writers very clearly did not write the season with any aim to be conclusive. Plot threads are laid all across the season that are never touched upon but are clearly meant to be continued at some point. Anything involving Jason Todd and Ra's al Ghul, Cheshire, or the potential for giving non-metahumans the metagene is left unresolved.

It was dragged out over the course of three seasons (which amounted to a little more than two years in real life) and it didn't help that it was only focused on at least once per season and that it ultimately resolved via reset button where all the characters (barring Roger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">the one who started it in the first place</a>) would forget the events of the whole thing.

That's despite having the seeds planted as far back as the season 1 episode "The Blue Spirit". Viewers were guessing it would happen even before that.

Lapis would make one appearance during the entirety of Season 2 via a telepathic conversation, while Malachite herself wouldn't reappear until the Season 3 premiere, which also resolved that plot thread by defeating and unfusing her. Between the Lapis episode and the Season 3 premiere were two consecutive story arcs; three, if you want to treat Peridot's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> as separate from the concurrent Cluster arc.

It didn't help any that the manga only released one chapter a month. Although the Nilfheim arc turned out to be a significant improvement (a lot of stuff happens, many minor characters from the past make cameos, and the main couple's relationship finally began to move forward again), the series ended right after that, <em>25 years</em> after it began. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Happily, it ended with their marriage.</span>

It's generally accepted even by fans of the series that over two-thirds of the chapters could be removed from the story's middle section, and the overall narrative wouldn't be impacted <em>at all</em>; most of what wasn't just repeating itself in that time frame was relatively brief.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em>. The manga started November, 1997, and the only closure we have as-of-yet is the anime, which completely branched out into its own after it ran out of source material. But the fangirls are still waiting. Oh, yes, we're still waiting. As a matter of fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukiruSugisaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YukiruSugisaki">Yukiru Sugisaki</a> is infamous for her habit of starting another manga before finishing the one she was working on.

Several years and volumes of flashback later, and Guts begins setting off on a quest to restore Casca to sanity. This was in 1997. He only just arrived in September 2016. Of course, that's not nearly as long as it sounds <em>chapter</em>-wise, but an insanely detailed art style has led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">a very slow and irregular release schedule</a>. There have been only about 300 chapters <em>total</em> since the series started back in <strong>1990</strong>.

<ul><li> Chapter 54 ends with the line "End of Prologue." If 54 chapters of a weekly-turned-monthly-comic being a "prologue" doesn't give you an idea of how long the author plans to write this, then nothing will. Guess he's living up to the name Vinland <em>Saga.</em>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">so-called</a> Farmland Saga arc certainly exhibits this. Since the author wanted to separate Thorfinn's life in slavery from his former life as much as possible, the pace is veeeery deliberate, and it takes several chapters for anything significant to happen. Stuff has started happening, however, and the pace has quickened once again.

Several volumes later, Negi isn't even close to finding him and although some details of the backstory have been revealed, they don't help much to figure out what happened to Negi's father, especially after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's revealed to be the Lifemaker's current host</span>.

A lot. Since the story's debut in 1997, Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates aren't much closer to finding the One Piece than when they started. While there have been hints, there's not only been no answer as to where the One Piece even is, there's been no answer as to <em>what</em> it even is.

Oda's response: "Soon". <em>Six</em> years later, the Straw Hats set sail with Fishman Island as their next destination<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1975g6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1975g6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1975g6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it's revealed to be the last place in the first half of the Grand Line, which you <em>have</em> to pass through to get to the New World or else go through the freaking capital of the World Government</span>, only to spend a year's worth of story on what boils down to a side trip. Then, they're finally one stop away from the elusive underwater island, all they need to do is finish preparations... and the story gets epically sidetracked yet again. The focus was off of the Straw Hat crew in favor of just Luffy, showing his backstory and a desire to get stronger. In late 2010, the Straw Hats <em>finally</em> made it to Fishman Island, nine years after Oda's proclamation that they would arrive "soon."
</li><li> Regardless of which you consider the myth arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, Ippo fighting Miyata again or Ippo becoming the world champion, the series has reached its 900th chapter with no signs of progress with either. In fact, the rematch with Miyata has been steadily delayed for over five hundred chapters or in other words, a decade. Not to mention how Ippo and Kumi have been dating for about as long <em>and haven't even kissed yet</em>. Even worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Ippo losing his recent comeback match and mentally confirming that something's seriously wrong with him, readers now have to confront the possibility that <em>neither</em> potential myth arc will be resolved. Certainly Ippo becoming world champion seems to be dead as a story goal</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em> has got to be some kind of record holder - despite the fact the comic started in 1976, we <em>still</em> have yet to find out who will be cast as "The Crimson Goddess". On top of that, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> hasn't actually resolved either. That's over forty years without resolution to two key plot points. The severe bouts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a> haven't helped any either. There have been <em>three</em> different anime that have come out in that time, none of which even attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> to provide some semblance of resolution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWallflower">The Wallflower</a></em>. 28 volumes and counting, and Sunako and Kyouhei <em>still</em> haven't confessed seriously or even <em>admitted they feel romantic love</em>. That drumming sound you hear is the fans' heads banging against the wall.
</li><li> The manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> started in <em>1995</em>, and it <em>finally</em> came to an end with Chapter 95. In July 2013. Yeah, that's 18 years later. Especially egregious considering that the manga only recounts what happened in the 26 episodes of the anime + <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheEndOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheEndOfEvangelion">The End of Evangelion</a></em> movie - all of which has been resolved since 1997. Unlike other adaptations, the manga stayed very close to the original anime and it didn't add any additional content except for slight change of order and the infamous scene of Kaworu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">killing a kitten</a>. Understandably in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">similar vein to the original anime many fans begin to question the sanity of the artist.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensLostProperty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeavensLostProperty">Heaven's Lost Property</a></em> treads into this territory.

Add to that it's a monthly manga and the fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">it's taking forever to get answers</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> is, as of the end of 2019, at 97 books and 1036 collected chapters (uncollected chapters bring it over 1040 total, with the 300th case underway), although if you removed all the cases which don't progress the main or side plots, the numbers would likely be closer to 20 and 250.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The failed first attempt to retrieve Sasuke ended in 2005 after six volumes, and for <em>years</em> they were still nowhere near close to getting him back. It finally happened in <em>2013</em>, and even then, he didn't <em>really</em> complete the damn turn until 2014, during the last three chapters of the manga. The anime has over 200 episodes in the first half and over 300 in part 2. Good luck trying to keep up.
</li><li> The <em>Naruto</em> anime and its sequel, <em>Naruto: Shippuden</em> are infamous for their awful pacing, no thanks to endless flashbacks that often dragged down action scenes. In total, the filler takes up approximately <strong>40%</strong> of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto">each<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto-shippuden">series<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> To wit: forty-five new episodes aired in 2015, and only <strong>eight</strong> were plot-relevant.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20hz84');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note20hz84" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20hz84');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Naruto died in Christmas of 2014, and Might Guy only used the Eighth Gate in July 2015; those events happened eight manga chapters apart.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> took about 65 chapters just to start explaining what the titans are and where they came from. That may not sound like much, but AoT is released only around once a month or so. Most of the world building comes almost at random in small bits and pieces, choosing to focus more on the character interactions and politics of living in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> than the world itself. Also, one of the manga's biggest questions &mdash; just what the hell Eren's father hid in his basement &mdash; only got revealed in September 2016, more than five years after the manga first started publication.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> was notorious for this with its utterly slow pacing after the Daily Life arc, to the point that it got the series cancelled. The Soul Society, Arrancar, and Blood War arcs always stalled the story for fights, fights and more fights just to give screen time to supporting characters. Granted, the characters showed off new abilities, but the battles were always a tug of war and a few wound up ending with an outside source having to step in to finish the battle. When Ichigo finally confronts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Yhwach in the final arc, the battle is ridiculously short due to the fact the manga author's health was swiftly failing, leaving him unable to continue producing it and resulting in a rushed climax and ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos">Infinite Stratos</a></em>: Instead of moving the plot forward, the show keeps introducing girls too Ichika's harem and putting to much focus on the harem antics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the end of season 2, the heroes are no closer to stopping Phantom Task than they were at the beginning, and the <em>World Purge</em> OVA is just an extended romantic fantasy almost entirely disconnected to the main plot.</span> Not helping at all are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slips</a> caused by the author's health problems. As of 2016, the franchise hasn't released any new content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl">Daily Life with Monster Girl</a></em> has been suffering this for a while regarding the primary question of the series- which member of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a> is Kimihito going to marry? It's become increasingly ridiculous as the series has gone on, since things have progressed from human-liminal relationships being forbidden to the point where there are now dating services and singles' events specifically geared toward interspecies relationships. It's not helped by the side arcs that have focused on the supporting characters or the fact that publishing has slowed from roughly a chapter per month to one every four to five months.

The story is about an amnesiac man who's found on the beach and has the number XIII on his collarbone. The first book came out in 1984.

<ul><li> Desmond Miles' arc, which kept interrupting the much more interesting and entertaining segments as Altair/Ezio/etc. Desmond himself did get platforming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> sections, but they were extremely linear and often didn't have any optional objectives or side areas. By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a></em> ended Desmond's story arc, nobody cared about him anymore.
</li><li> Then there is the fact that Assassins and Templars have been trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> with no end in sight. Even some characters in game have expressed concerns over the fact both sides have fought this long without even trying to reach a compromise but are usually brushed off.
</li></ul></li><li> Those who criticize the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> often cite this. In each expansion, the Alliance and Horde have faced enemies that threatened both of them, and instead of working together to end the threat, they bring their war with them everywhere they go. The fact that both factions are currently led by a couple of belligerent warmongers does not help matters, either. In <em>The Burning Crusade</em>, the blood elves and the draenei (and their respective allies) put aside their differences to fight the Burning Legion under the naaru. In <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, the orcs and humans escalate the war <em>while inside of the home zone of the Lich King</em>, though the Argent Crusade still manages to create a successful joint offensive. In <em>Cataclysm</em>, the war escalates to a full-scale war while Deathwing is trying to destroy the planet. In <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, the war is the primary plot, while the evils of Pandaria are dealt with and become weapons of the Horde later.
<ul><li> This is lampshaded by Wrathion, who is frustrated with the inability for the Alliance and Horde to truly work together to defend against a larger threat: the Burning Legion, and tries to manipulate events so that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Alliance achieves dominance over the Horde</span>.
</li><li> This is largely averted in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, where both factions work together to fight the Iron Horde, and conflict is mostly limited to a competition to recover rare artifacts from a remote island. The promotional material for Legion also seems to indicate that the Alliance and Horde will truly join forces to battle the Burning Legion.
</li><li> Legion did indeed feature the Alliance and Horde putting their differences aside long enough to defeat the Burning Legion, but the aftermath of Sargeras's defeat reignited the feud. The next expansion, Battle for Azeroth, brought the faction war front and center as the primary driver of the plot. Endgame content was shorted in favor of ever increasing PvP objectives, much to the dismay of PvE players.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> Iconian Arc, hinted at during an old mission back when the game was first released, then dragged along once Cryptic changed owners and began tightening up the game. The entire story took five years, ten seasons and two expansions to complete.

A combination of having to make sequels against the creator's will, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">Pandering to the Base</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> led to a slew of games which all claimed would explain exactly why Big Boss turned towards evil, and all of which ended up showing little more than Big Boss being in morally dubious environments in which he has to do horrible things for justifiable reasons, and at the end of every game taking off his bandanna and saying he accepts the title of Big Boss. The final game in this arc, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidV">Metal Gear Solid V</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes">2014</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">2015</a>), was hyped as being the one that would show the turn <em>for real</em>, but this would turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superdickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superdickery">Superdickery</a>, with the reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Big Boss who actually did all the horrible things he's responsible for before the MSX games was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble">Body Double</a></span>; with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> gone from the series, it is fair to say that we have had five whole Big Boss games to explain how he eventually became an insane, despotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> without any of them actually showing that, and we will never get one.

After these powers subconsciously manifest within Kensou in order to save Athena, he later makes a vow at the end of the arc to master them. Meanwhile, <em>2000</em> sees the introduction of Lin, a mysterious member of Hizoku (a clan of Chinese assassins) who has the entered the tournament to find leads on Ron, the former head of Hizoku who betrayed his kin to join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization">the NESTS cartel</a>. Ron himself appears as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter">Striker</a> for Zero, the sub-boss of <em>2001</em>, and both he and Lin disappear following the defeat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Igniz</a> in the same game. <em>2003</em> then introduces players to Duo Lon, another Hizoku assassin and one of Ron's numerous sons, who joins KOF to do some reconnaissance of his own regarding his father. The next installment, <em>XI</em>, has Kensou return from his training with newfound mastery over the Dragon Spirit&mdash;a development noticed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTakesAnInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTakesAnInterest">an approving Ron</a>, who is now joined by a small group of supporters including the aforementioned Lin and Misty (Igniz's lover).

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series has started to face this problem ever since the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Fusion</a></em>. The game follows <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> with the Space Pirates virtually eliminated, and ends on the note of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> planning to weaponize Metroids for their own sinister purposes</span>. None of the games released after <em>Fusion</em> have built on the latter point, as all of them have either been interquels (the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Prime</a></em> subseries and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Other M</a></em>) or remakes (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Zero Mission</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns">Samus Returns</a></em>), with <em>Other M</em> in particular merely reiterating <em>Fusion</em>'s big revelation earlier in the timeline.

By the end of 2019, Ava is no closer to reuniting the other demons than she was when the comic started, and even though she is surrounded by three of them, she only knows about two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BittersweetCandyBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BittersweetCandyBowl">Bittersweet Candy Bowl</a></em>. With not a single arc or subplot to point to, its been all angst and drama with no end in sight for years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em>, via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> and sidestories, has suffered minorly from this early on, with later chapters improving it. Many fans were quite amused when one forum-goer noted that thanks to the creators remaking the first several chapters <a class="urllink" href="http://www.drowtales.com/mainarchive.php?sid=631">one character<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had been carrying around another dead character's dead body for the better part of three real-world years <a class="urllink" href="http://www.drowtales.com/mainarchive.php?sid=5843">until he showed up again.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile">Misfile</a></em>, it has taken six years to cover about six months worth of story and there is still six months worth of story ahead. Three entire chapters (of about 120 pages each) of pure filler and padding and no plot advancement, which took about a year and a half to play. Even the hardcore fans were beginning to rebel. It's taken 17 volumes to advance 9 months and it has been admitted in comic that the only way the Misfile can be resolved is through some divine miracle that is unlikely. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has stated the series won't end until Ash graduates high school, it's quite clear it will not be moving forward any time soon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SugarBits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SugarBits">Sugar Bits</a></em> which started off with an interesting premise and a trip to a nightmare world. Things came to a screeching halt once the protagonists meet Licorice and have since been in battle with her forces that, (as of this entry) <em>is still going</em>. Granted this is mostly due to the artist flip-flopping between this and his other comics. But one could cover three story arcs in the time it takes for the characters of this series to strike a blow. As of 2012, this fight has finally ended, but the artist has fallen into this with another one of his own series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PowerpuffGirlsDoujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PowerpuffGirlsDoujinshi">Powerpuff Girls Doujinshi</a></em>, which has been stuck on one fight scene for several months.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite the fact that Pete's been saying that he's wrapping the strip up since 2007, the main characters haven't gotten any closer to defeating HeretiCorp or Oasis, or figuring out the mystery of Oasis since 2009. The gang has looked like they were about to get somewhere with this multiple times, only to go off on one diversion after another.
</li><li> Gwynn used to be this, just falling out of the strip in 2009, and the arc of Torg slowly going insane. Both of these could be instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">Gwynn came back later, though.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> also falls under this category, as despite going on for years the heroes are only just as of 2015 actually managing to start moving against the villains and take steps towards completing their game session after essentially a whole act of teenage angst dominating the plot. Not helped by Andrew Hussie taking a year off to work on the Homestuck video game and other merchandise. Andrew Hussie intended to release the rest of Homestuck in one big burst, which was rendered completely null when circumstances forced him to go back to updating the comic as it's drawn. With a year-long hiatus behind it, and another pause near the end of Act 6 Act 6 Intermission 5, it took <em>seven years</em> for the kids to finish the blasted game. A common suggestion among the fandom is that the abrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> was written that way just so the comic could finally <em>be</em> finished.
</li><li> Whether you consider Lord Tedd or Magus to be the subject of the myth arc for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive">El Goonish Shive</a></em>, both have been going on an interminably long time. Lord Tedd was introduced early in the strip's run, and seemed to be building up to be the comic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, but he was basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> after the Painted Black arc, and aside from implications that Tedd might be going down the same path he hasn't been even <em>mentioned</em> since 2008. This is largely due to Magus' storyline intruding at the start of 2007. That storyline is only just now hitting its climax, nearly <em>eleven years later</em>. That there are multiple arcs peppering the comic's run that aren't much related to <em>either</em> plotline doesn't help. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21e6wo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21e6wo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21e6wo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">See the comic's entry in the Story Stall section for at least one example.</span>
