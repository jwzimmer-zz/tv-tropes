<div class="acaptionright" style="width:331px;">But is he happy?</div>
<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"Kings do not have friends - only subjects and enemies."</em>
<div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Proverb of long-lived miserable kings</strong>
</div></div>

<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A character is driven to become the best there is &mdash; the richest man in town, the best martial artist in the world, the emperor of the galaxy...and succeeds.
</p><p>But, along the way, the character winds up abandoning or betraying everyone and everything they ever valued. They will inevitably wind up bitter and alone, having fulfilled their great obsession, but pondering everything they lost in the pursuit &mdash; just before losing the thing they obsessed over too. ("If only I'd never left the family farm/talked to that man/become a model/signed that contract/etc.")
</p><p>This is often a form of reversed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment">Wish Fulfillment</a> for the viewer, as the average person wants to be able to think that the things they don't have (such as an abnormal amount of money, power, skill or beauty) won't lead to happiness, conveniently forgetting how, in real life, there are plenty of poor, enslaved, stupid and ugly people that <em>are</em> unhappy. But since not everyone wants the same things out of life, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> doesn't always work that way.

</p><p>This phrase originates from the Chinese proverb "&#39640;&#34389;&#19981;&#21213;&#23506;/&#39640;&#22788;&#19981;&#32988;&#23506;"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wqn9');"><sup>Note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0wqn9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wqn9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Traditional and simplified Chinese respectively.</span>, which literally means "it's cold at the top (of a mountain)". It is commonly used to describe people of high positions may feel lonely at the top. Though that is not all to this proverb, it also means that individuals of high positions gradually become suspicious of those around him/her, thus feeling shivers running up and down the spine constantly. A similar proverb, <em>huipulla tuulee</em>, "it's windy at the (mountain) top", exists in Finnish, implying being on the top is both lonely <em>and</em> precarious.

<ul><li> In one chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>, a missive from headquarters results in Private Tamama (temporarily) becoming the new leader of the squad. He promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">goes mad with power</a>, and ends up throwing the Hinatas, Moa, and all his squad-mates in the brig.

</li><li> The Emperor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Photon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Photon">Photon</a></em> has been the sole and absolute ruler of the galaxy for a few thousand years, and it became so boring that he allowed one of his subordinates to hatch a plan to achieve ultimate power and depose him, just so he'd have someone powerful to fight at the end.
</li><li> Coyote Starrk from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">the Espada</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>. All of the ten Espada represent an aspect of death; his is 'Loneliness' because his enormous powers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tended to drain the life out of any other Hollows who came near him and resulted in all of them avoiding him like the plague.</span> He eventually split his soul into two separate beings just to have someone he could hang out with: the other part became his Fracci&oacute;n, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass">Lilynette</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Gingerback</a>.
<ul><li> In Chapter 422, Ichigo claims that Aizen was lonely at the top all along. When he and Aizen fought, the only thing he could sense from Aizen's zanpakatou was "solitude", which is supported by the databooks. He believes that the Hogyouku, rather than rejecting Aizen as a master, had finally granted Aizen's <em>true</em> wish: to be a "normal" Shinigami. Why it felt the way to do this was to give him more and more power until the very last second when it takes that power back is anyone's guess. The claim also tends to lose some impact given his previous and subsequent arrogance, and the fact that all of his actions were explicitly in the interest of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> becoming a god.</span>
</li><li> Both Unohana and Kenpachi were revealed to be this before they first met. They were both killing criminals, desperately trying to find a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>. When they found each other, they both felt the rush and fear of battle. In fact, this was what caused Kenpachi to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>. However, even as a child, he was stronger than Unohana, and his fear at being unable to experience that rush again caused him to subconsciously limit his power, along consciously limiting it with his eyepatch. Causing him to do this is what Unohana, even to this day, considers her greatest sin and regret.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, where Light is shown to betray anyone and everyone in order to get to the top and become the god of the new world. One would expect that in the end, everyone is shown realizing this and turning against him - however, it is shown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that even years after his death, there are still many worshipers who greatly mourn his death</span>. It's implied that successfully <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing L</span> has left Light bored and depressed, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> good ol' L</span> was the only person as smart as Light (and thus one of the few people he could relate to on any level). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The sheer joy he expresses when he thinks he's found a replacement for L, and the rage he expresses when the new L doesn't live up to his expectations add to this interpretation.</span>

<ul><li> Accelerator is one of these types. He's the number one esper in Academy City (and the world) and almost literally nobody can touch him unless he consciously lets them, which caused many assassination attempts and experiments on him, turning him into a rather lonely sadist. He got so desperate that he joined an experiment to try to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">raise him up to Level 6</a>, believing that if he could have ultimate power, then nobody would ever try to fight him again and he would finally be accepted.

She had no friends; all of her henchmen follow her out of fear or because she offered them something. Touma eventually realizes that all her actions stemmed from a desire to find someone who truly understood her.

Touma proves that he understands her, causing her to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.

<ul><li> An omake did this when it imagined the Straw Hats as mobsters. They each end up killing each other (except for Nami, who dies of happiness after seeing so much gold) until the only one left is Luffy, who at first is ecstatic over having all the meat to himself...until he realizes how lonely he is without anyone to share it with.
</li><li> World's Strongest Swordsman Mihawk. His expression is always stern and he rarely ever acts unless it's out of some form of curiosity. Being the best swordsman in the world has obviously left him with not much to do while waiting for a half-decent challenger. And he is so far above the next best swordsman that really digs at him. It's been shown that the last worthy challenger he had was over a decade ago in-universe. The challenger was Shanks, back when he had two arms.

This is actually a recurring issue throughout <em>Life and Times</em> where Scrooge's victories are at best bittersweet because while he triumphs, he's also inevitably left without anyone to enjoy his victories with. Best shown in Chapter 4, where his friends immediately turn on him out of envy once he strikes it rich; Chapter 8, where he finally makes his fortune but loses the love of his life; Chapter 9, where he becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand">Stranger in a Familiar Land</a> because his travels have changed him too much; and Chapter 11, where for the first and only time he seeks to make money dishonestly, which ultimately costs him his family. Although he later/in other books somewhat subverts it or simply just ignores it: The book itself ends with Scrooge reconnecting with his family and rekindling his lust of adventure as well as being reminded of his past skills as a self-made duck. In later works his family is never really bothered by his wealth, he is always finding more adventures and they usually follow. Due to this attitude and/or his extreme greed, he also lives no better than they themselves and will happily attend family gatherings, go camping or fight with his nephew rather than dining in fine restaurants, sleeping in high-class hotels or sending some bodyguard.

He's a person and people make mistakes but when someone as brilliant as he is does, it causes really bad consequences. He and his brother are still pretty distant as adults as Aberforth never really forgave him and he really just doesn't have many people that understand him.

On <em>the very day of his coronation</em>, he laments that by fulfilling the witches' prophecy, he's also ensured that Banquo's descendants, not his, would be the future kings of Scotland. "<em>I'm</em> the one who orchestrated Duncan's murder, and <em>he</em> gets to have the dynasty! Stupid worthless crown!" Even worse, he <em>knew</em> this would happen because the witches told him. Needless to say, it was all downhill from there.

</li><li> Abd-er-Rahman, the Caliph of Andalusia, did not seem to enjoy supreme executive power all that much:
<div class="indent">I have now reigned about fifty years in victory or peace, beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honors, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot. They amount to fourteen.
</div></li><li> As Michael Pritchard once said, "No matter how rich you become, how famous or powerful, when you die the size of your funeral will still pretty much depend on the weather."
</li><li> Barbara Hutton, the heiress to the Woolworth fortune. She was the richest woman in the world during her lifetime, but it was a life filled with chronic loneliness and depression.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deadmau5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deadmau5">deadmau5</a> has shown this. He has a <a class="urllink" href="http://choleric-mau5.blogspot.com/2010/09/everyone-wants-something.html">blog post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about not being able to have a "normal" romantic relationship because of his fame, and he's mentioned suffering from depression and anxiety, especially after he broke up with his girlfriend.
</li><li> By its very nature, becoming an elite, Top of the Anything, means that you are different from the rest, which means that you have fewer peers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced</a> by online games which restrict players to only playing against those in their same rank, like <em>Red Crucible 2</em>. If your rank gets too high, you'll find yourself playing the same people over and over, and may miss the huge swathes of unfamiliar people at the lower ranks.
</li><li> Geniuses could have trouble socializing because normal people may appear to them as complete idiots who can barely grasp the beauty of quantum physics and other things even other "smart" people struggle with. This would lead to fairly common cases of depression unless they make sure to surround themselves with other geniuses. (Naturally, the term 'genius' itself is highly subjective, so this isn't necessarily true for all cases, never mind other exceptions.)
</li><li> This often happens to lottery winners. They may now be fabulously wealthy, but between a flood of hangers-on bugging them for money or pressuring them to make business investments of questionable worth, shady accountants, parasitic litigants (often family members and ex-partners) trying to get quick and easy settlements, predatory financial advisers, and other people itching to find ways to take a piece of the pie for themselves, they often wind up losing their ability to trust anyone and cut themselves off from the world as a result. And since many of them become broke again in short order, they could end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolAndHisNewMoneyAreSoonParted">right back where they started</a>, with their faith in humanity shattered.
</li><li> The Emperors of China referred to themselves as "Gua Ren" (literally, the lonely one) because they are both without equals and without fathers.
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> according to Forbes:
<ul><li> If this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2013/10/09/lonely-at-the-top/">Forbes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> article seems to indicate, then this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for company CEOs. Here is the gist: They ultimately take the sole responsibility of running a company, they are expected to have all of the answers to all of the questions in regards to their business, they have to keep people together, and the nature of their job is actually very different to even the number two.
</li><li> Another issue is that if you are a female worker, you will struggle to get your voice heard even if you are an executive, according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/05/01/executives-c-suite-leadership-forbes-woman-power-careers.html">this article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It also does not help that female business executives are still the minority.
</li></ul></li><li> One reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWeAreBummedCommunismFell">Why We Are Bummed Communism Fell</a> from America's side is that the United States doesn't have a clear rival superpower anymore, and while it is considered the global hyperpower, the lack of a clear enemy has made foreign policy very confused, massive defense spending seemed to be unjustified and there were cuts to funding the sciences since there was no Soviet rival to go up against. America's more questionable actions are also harder to justify against Middle Eastern terrorists and while Russia and China are still rivals, their economies are too intertwined with America which keeps everyone in an awkward spot.
</li><li> Markus "Notch" Persson has stated that his wealth from creating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> and selling it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XboxGameStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XboxGameStudios">Microsoft</a> has made his personal life much more isolated.
</li><li> Jascha Heifetz &#150; arguably the greatest violinist of all time &#150; according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.peterrosenproductions.com/productions/jaschaheifetz/">this documentary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The quote at the top was paraphrased and turned on its head by Queen Isabella of Castile when she thought that her husband's uncle was being too familiar by calling him "nephew": "The King has no friends nor relatives, only subjects." Ironically, Isabella's father had died lamenting that he ever became king.
</li><li> On the flip-side, when someone improves his or herself intellectually and/or financially, the individual may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">end up losing friends due to jealousy and hate</a>.
