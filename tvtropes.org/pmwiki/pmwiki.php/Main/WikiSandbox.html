According to the trope description, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoebiusNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoebiusNeighborhood">Moebius Neighborhood</a> is for houses with only one neighbor, even if there are other adjacent houses. However, its actual usage is all over the place; common usages include cases where a house has multiple neighbors, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeographicFlexibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeographicFlexibility">all but one of them is inconsistent</a> (which can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewNeighborsAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewNeighborsAsThePlotDemands">New Neighbors As The Plot Demands</a>); cases where one neighbor is more important than the rest; and cases where a family doesn't know their neighbors.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> in comics has two neighbors, one named Jones and one named Smith. They are, however, functionally identical, as they are both sworn enemies of Donald. In fact, most recent comics ignore Smith. <strong>Misuse</strong>
<ul><li> Often, Donald's other neighbor will just be whoever happens to fit the story (though kind old ladies seem popular). Or it could be someone new who moves in and forces an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situation between Donald and Mr. Jones by annoying both. These things get pretty formulaic after one reads many of the comics. <strong>Variant</strong>
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Circles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Circles">Circles</a></em>, the only important neighbors are Mrs. Nussbaum and Carter Allen and his family. <strong>Misuse</strong>
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>: While a few of the other rich folk who live in Bruce's neighborhood show up in stories from time to time, usually because they're being robbed or are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">corrupt corporate executives</a>, they rarely make more than one appearance. The house next door that is right at the entrance of the Wayne estate though has the Drake family move in and they become recurring characters until their deaths since their son Tim becomes the newest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a>. <strong>Variant</strong>
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clerks">Clerks</a></em> (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClerksTheAnimatedSeries">Clerks: The Animated Series</a></em>), the convenience store, as far as we know, has only the video store next to it &mdash; thus making it an interesting case of a Moebius Strip Mall. <strong>Correct</strong>
<ul><li> One of the many <em>Clerks</em> comic book stories involves the clerks finally noticing a small store set in between the locations. Turns out an old, bearded guy named Claus runs it. <strong>Misuse</strong>
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> This is one of the questions frequently raised about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>. Harry spends an awful lot of time in the Gryffindor common room or eating at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, yet some of his fellow (and not new) Gryffindors are still strangers by the time he meets them in books five and six. He would have to have been actively avoiding these people for years in order not to at least know who they are. <strong>Misuse</strong>
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmallWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmallWonder">Small Wonder</a></em> never showed us the Lawsons' other neighbors, as if they and the Brindles were the only families on their block. <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> The early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> had the Rhodes as the Bundys' neighbors... and nobody else. Later seasons introduced Bob Rooney, another man from the neighborhood, as a recurring character, though it's unclear whether he lives on the other side of the Bundys, or somewhere else nearby. <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Played with in the PBS show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV">Square One TV</a></em>. During the "Mathnet" sketches, George Frankly would often speak of his "right-side neighbor, Mr. Beasley," without ever mentioning who was on the left side. However, in later seasons, the "Math Brigade" sketches detailed the adventures of Dirk Niblick and his "left-side neighbor, Mr. Beasley," which gives <em>Beasley</em> two sets of neighbors. <strong>Mixed</strong>

<p></p></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em> lives across the street from his annoying parents, but neither house seems to have one <strong>beside</strong> it. <strong>Correct</strong>

The gang <em>do</em> know other people in their building,( Mr Heckles, Danny, Joey's singing friend, Ugly Naked Guy (who actually lives in a building across the street)) Played straight with their actual floor, as only Apartment 19 and 20 exist: We see the gang running across the hallway to each other, using it as a thoroughfare, never locking their doors, having joint parties in the hallway, getting into fights, riding pogo sticks, putting the chick and the duck out there...without the other residents ever appearing. They may as well have demolished the walls and joined the apartments up completely. <strong>Mixed</strong>
<p></p></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedTrope">Lampshaded</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">The Drew Carey Show</a></em> when one of Drew's wacky neighbors from the early episodes drops by. Drew, not being too happy about them always showing up, asks her, "Don't you have neighbours on the other side?" <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Either played straight or averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown">Cougar Town</a></em>, depending on how many houses there are on the cul-de-sac. Either there are not many houses and we know all or most of the residents, or it's a good example of this trope. <strong>Mixed</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Steve Urkel on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> lived next door to the Winslows for most of the series, but eventually he moved in with them. Apparently this left a vacancy in the neighborhood's only other house, because shortly thereafter a new obnoxious neighbor, Nick Niedermeyer, moved in to the former Urkel residence. <strong>ZCE</strong>
<p></p></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>, the Matthewses and Mr. Feeny are always talking over the fence between their adjacent side yards, but we never see an inch of the rest of the street, or even the rest of their yards. <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist">Round the Twist</a></em>, the only neighbour of the Twists is Nell. However, as the Twists live in a lighthouse near a cliff's edge, this is pretty realistic. <strong>Justified</strong>
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> had new neighbors in the house next door every few years. Sometimes they would be heavy in the plot, and others would be around for a one off joke. No neighbors living in any <em>other</em> house on the block were ever mentioned or interacted with, though. <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> <em>Bitmap World</em> averts this: Both the Smileys and the Ks are plot-relevant. <strong>Aversion</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Andy Weir talks about his attempts to avert this trope in <a class="urllink" href="http://galactanet.com/comic/view.php?strip=636">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaseyAndAndy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaseyAndAndy">Casey and Andy</a></em> newspost (scroll down to the Trivia Tidbit). <strong>ZCE</strong>
<p></p></li><li> This is what is shaping up for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Savestate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Savestate">Savestate</a></em>. The only known neighbors for Kade and Nicole at the house they inherited from their Uncle Scooby are a family of reindeer that live across the street. This includes Amber and her two children, Chris and Claire. He know Kade and Nicole's parents live "a long car ride" away from their house. <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Living next door to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a> are, of course, the Flanders. But on the other side? Ruth Powers and her teenage daughter Laura. Never heard of them? Don't feel bad; they've appeared in a grand total of maybe two episodes. <strong>Variant</strong>
<ul><li> And before them there were the Winfields, who appeared in four episodes, including the one where they moved out to be replaced by the Powers. In fact, Ruth's most recent appearance ("Strong Arm of the Ma") suggests they're not living there anymore, either... <strong>Variant</strong>
</li><li> A few episodes seem to forget that the house next door exists at all in any way, shape or form. <strong>Correct</strong>
</li><li> Similarly, the house across the street from the Simpsons, alternates quite rapidly, some episodes it's a huge mansion as in the episode where George Bush moves in, other times it's a vacant lot, most of the time it's just another regular house with nondescript occupants, but once it was shown that Carl lived there which was never mentioned again. <strong>Variant</strong>
</li><li> Of course, there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/SeparateSimpsonsGeographyThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/SeparateSimpsonsGeographyThing">Separate Simpsons Geography Thing</a> anyway. And the first time 742 Evergreen Terrace was mentioned, it was a generic house being burgled by Snake rather than the Simpsons' house, adding to the confusion. <strong>Correct</strong>
</li><li> Similarly, behind the Simpsons' backyard is most commonly sheer empty space (nothing is drawn behind the fence) or wilderness, but it has also been everything from a graveyard to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. <strong>Variant</strong>
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> has only one set of neighbors, the Muddlefoots. <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Eventually abandoned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>, in which a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">Addams Family</a> knockoffs: The Gruesomes moved next to the <em>other</em> side of Fred and Wilma from the Rubbles. <strong>Mixed</strong>
<ul><li> In the 1980s they got a similar cast of neighbours, the Frankenstones, who seemed to be based more around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a>. The head of the family is a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">Frankenstein's Monster</a> knockoff, and he and Fred really hate each other's guts, even when everyone else gets along fine. <strong>Aversion</strong>
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Up until around the sixth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, it seemed as if the Dinkleburgs (relationship's pretty much ripped off Homer and Ned) were the only neighbors to the Turners. It turned out their other neighbors included a black family and a extremely stereotypical British family. Naturally, they only existed for the sake of the plot of one particular episode and have yet to be seen again. <strong>Variant, with a little complaining</strong>
<ul><li> The Pfifers [the black neighbors] did reappear as one of the childless couples outshining the Turners in "The Masked Magician". <strong>Aversion</strong>
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans">The Backyardigans</a></em>. There are three houses behind the titular (and pretty big) backyard, but its residents are never shown. <strong>Correct</strong>
<ul><li> If you pay attention to the end of the episodes, you'll see the three houses belong to the families of Pablo, Tyrone, and Uniqua. They are color coordinated to the characters. Austin lives on the other side of the fence to right, and Tasha lives across the street. If anything, this show subverts the trope. <strong>Subversion</strong>
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Carl is the only neighbor of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em>, and they are his only neighbors (except for the half season or so when they were kidnapped/evicted and their landlord rented the place out to even worse people to live near). Probably makes sense considering how the Aqua Teens seem to demolish property values. Even when there's <strong>Correct</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, as the Griffin family's neighbors (Cleveland and Loretta Brown, Mort and Muriel Goldman, Glenn Quagmire, Joe and Bonnie Swanson, and Herbert) form most of the supporting cast. <strong>Aversion</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Averted greatly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>. The Hills' family home in Rainy Street is near four sets of neighbors who regularly appear in the show. Also occasionally, there is somebody moving in the house in front of the Hills' home. <strong>Aversion</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Averted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KickButtowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KickButtowski">Kick Buttowski</a></em>. A bunch of the Buttowskis' neighbors make regular appearances, including Gunther and his family, Jackie, Mr. Vickle, Ms. Chicorelli, and in "Kick or Treat" it was revealed that Kendall was living next door to Kick the entire time (which he somehow did not know). <strong>Aversion</strong>
<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>: The Robinsons are essentially the only neighbors of the Wattersons. A few shots show various supporting cast and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringExtra">Recurring Extras</a> living in nearby houses, but only Gary the mailman is seen consistently&#151;and even he's been shown living in several different houses ("The Wand" and "The Allergy" both show Gary living on the house opposite to the Robinsons' house, in "The Remote" he lives across the street, and in "The Nest" and "The Neighbor", to the left of the Wattersons). <strong>Variant</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Mort and the It's Your Funeral Home and Crematorium is to the left of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a>. A constantly changing array of businesses are to the right of the titular shop in the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag">opening titles</a>, but the lot in generally vacant in the body of the show's episodes. Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria is directly on the other side of the street, and various other nearby businesses are visited. <strong>Variant</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Chances are, if you live in a big city, you know <em>maybe</em> one or two sets of neighbors, if any at all. This is especially true if you live in a high rise, which can realistically house hundreds of apartments in a single building. The only people one tends to encounter are people on a similar schedule to his own, and at those times nobody's in the mood to stop and chat. Most city dwellers simply don't bother making neighbors' acquaintances. <strong>Misuse; I'm pretty sure this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NoRealLife/ImpossibleInRealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NoRealLife/ImpossibleInRealLife">Impossible in Real Life</a>.</strong>
<p></p></li><li> Comedian Dara &Oacute; Brian has a bit about how he and his wife know all the neighbors on their side of the street, but nobody on the other side. He claims they were all hanging out one day and he learned that <em>nobody</em> knew anyone from the other side, and he wanted to get a posse together to march across and find out why. "Are we not good enough for you? Stuck-up even-numbered pricks!" <strong>Correct as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a>; belongs under Other, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a></strong>

In "Deconstruction of Falling Stars", there is a scene where a simulation of Michael Garibaldi along with the rest of the main characters have been created for the express purpose of making propaganda to smear the good name of the senior officers of the space station, as they have ascended to near mythical status for the good works they did during the formation of the Interstellar Alliance. After witnessing the horrible acts his friends are being forced to do by a technician working for the existing Earth government, the simulated Garibaldi breaks into the government computers and uploads the entire plan to the public interstellar network, triggering an immediate attack on the facility where he is being simulated and triggering a war against the corrupt Earth government.

</p><p></p><h2> Shit That Already Happened</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> In the original version of <em>Blessed, Unfortunately</em>, <em>Ordinarily United</em>, one chapter has Carlson reading what seems like a novel in a "less satirical" version of <em>The Unviewable Panties of Ishiko-Chan</em>, where Junko goes full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a> for Taro and keeps him locked up. [Okay this isn't something that "already happened" but still.] The remake, despite otherwise being from the ground up and having very little in common outside of the barebones plot structure and the characters, still keeps this scene in and in roughly the same point in-story, although the contents of the book have changed slighty.
</li><li> <em>The Unviewable Panties of Ishiko-Chan</em> quickly retconned in a cameo of someone who is basically Roy Geebilv as a high school student who appears at the beginning during one of Taro's ploys, just before the first chapter of <em>-Roy: Master of Debate</em>, because Water felt he wouldn't be able to get out the next <em>Unviewable</em> chapter before the slated release of <em>-Roy</em>.
</li><li> <em>-Roy</em>'s followup is a story set in the same overall "multiverse" (most of it is set in a parallel world however), so its "foreshadowing" is more along the lines of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a>. Seal 6 ends with a glimpse at the Perpendicular World, and chronologically, this is its first appearance. Although <em>-Roy</em> and <em>Joy|</em> were written so that they could be read in whichever order the reader wants to, and be switched around at will. Several characters from <em>-Roy</em> also make cameo appearances throughout <em>Joy|</em> and visa-versa, but by that point both stories were being written and it becomes a bizarre form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> instead, to the point where it's pretty difficult to switch chapters around in an order that <em>won't</em> result in the reader bumping in to a character from one story that had yet to be introduced in its counterpart.
</li><li> <em>Joy|</em>'s Third[?] Totem chapter goes over what the three homes of the human leads looks like, and Skyther's[?] includes a figure [shit, poster?] of Salph from <em>Hexadecisland</em>.
</li><li> Weird exception: The original draft of <em>361 Striking Degrees</em>, <em>360 Degree Duck</em>, began with the hero's prior roommates moving out. Said roommates, Tyler and Stacy, <em>were</em> going to be the title parent couple of <em>THE BEST FAMILY</em>, which was a story that was planned to be published <em>before</em> the original <em>360</em>, and Water's cameos back then would have been in reverse order (a character's likeness shows up in the story published <em>after</em> that but only as a quick cameo), but after changing things around it ended up being an attempted version of Production Foreshadowing instead. <em>THE BEST FAMILY</em> was then put on ice for a while and this cameo didn't really amount to more than just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag">Development Gag</a> at most.

</p><p>A highly powerful Shadebow, a "creation-guardian race" of humanoids that may or may not be related to them through evolution, or may or may not have more supernatural/divine origins than that. Either way, Shadebows are most known for their ability to make full alternate "clones" of themselves called "Shades," which reflect them with different emotions, combinations of emotions, or are otherwise counterparts of them in some way. Karen/Unitia One in particular is an expert at making Shades and she and her Shades, which she dubbed "Unitias," have mastered their secondary powers of basically making matter from nothing. Taking advantage of her status as the Eighth Circle's ex, she acted as a double-agent to get involved with his plan with the Infernos, tricking him in to thinking that she went back to his side. Once she reported everything she knew about the Eighth Circle's plan to wipe out humanity, namely the Eighth Circle's strange "power boost" from when he turned "14.5," she was assigned to work with Carlson under the fears that the Eighth Circle may finally be the one entity that could give him a challenge. Both Karen and Carlson initially <em>hated</em> the idea of working together, but against all odds during the planning prior to the attack, they got along and became a couple. A fierce, powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a> at that &mdash; Carlson has raw strength and better social skills, Karen has just about everything else: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">a variety of powers, an entire army to herself, knowledge in medicine and engineering, .</a>
</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: She's one of the most powerful characters in the story, being one of the very few who is not a "Blessed" or had power loaned from a Blessed (the Infernals) who can stand against them (when fused with enough Shades), yet she is one of the lowest-ranking heroes for a majority of it thanks to her doing horribly on the teamwork and essay portions of the entrance exams. When she first enrolled, she placed dead last and barely got in to the hero business in the first place, only even being accepted because her doing perfectly on the quiz and acing <em>everybody</em> in the solo physical tests (Carlson being the only character whose records she can't break). By the beginning of the story proper, which starts two years after her entrance, she's ninth-to-last, because of how hard it is for the lower-ranking heroes to climb up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: Ants. She and her Shades/Unitias are outright said to have strength relative to their size in a way comparable to ants, and
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>:
<ul><li> Telling her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleasePutSomeClothesOn">Please Put Some Clothes On</a>. You can get away with doing this exactly once, and if it comes out of sheer ignorance. <em>Insisting</em> it is a bad idea. Trying to force clothes on her is downright suicide, as the supervillain Pantalite can attest to. Suicide by means of being eaten alive by a swarm of "ants," to be specific.
</li><li> Yuullieke <em>period</em> is this. While anyone would understandably be mad if confronting their significant other's abusive ex, Karen's thoughts on her still stand out because just <em>mentioning</em> her either immediately pisses her off (if anybody else does the mentioning) or gets her in to a reassuring and gentle mood (if Carlson's the one who brings her up), and her reaction to finally seeing her in person is a downright <em>fury.</em> And <em>never</em> tell her that Yuullieke didn't do anything wrong, or that Carlson deserved the treatment she gave him, or that he "should have done" something else during those three and a half years.
</li><li> Never tell her any sentence that begins with something along the lines of "You'd look hotter if&mdash;" no matter how that sentence ends, things won't end well for you. Or <em>dare</em> try to suggest that she goes for a "cute" angle. Really, the Inventor is lucky to be alive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until he's killed for reasons only related to pissing off Karen on a tangent, but it was through actions that would piss off anybody</span>.
</li><li> When it comes to villains and criminals, she gets especially pissed off at <em>smug</em> ones. Her focus chapter at the beginning of the story has her stopping a bank robbery led by a guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">convinced he's the loveable anti-hero of a heist movie.</a> Karen doesn't kill him, but she absolutely breaks him both physically (literally, too, she breaks his legs) and emotionally. She has a similarly low opinion on villains who try to be "charming."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyGood">Creepy Good</a>: She's like a hybrid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRing">Sadako Yamamura</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Alucard</a> in terms of abilities and appearance, but she's firmly on the side of the heroes, and is even said both in-universe and out to have the strongest moral compass of the main five.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>:
<ul><li>
</li><li> A lot of her general concept was taken from elements of <em>Run: .GIFocalypse</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> getting an organized army made of "copies" of herself with a strong use of color coding, said army being gigantic, and each member being more powerful than the average character), but by the story proper she ended up being something of an <em>anti-</em>.GIFfany. .GIFfany in RG was a digital being who used dark magic to get a physical form, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a> who appears bright and sweet with an "innocent schoolgirl" look but turns out to be a manipulative, abusive murderer, and her abilities in canon were limited to making use of what was already there; her army in RG also had a very rocky relationship with her and got in to increasingly complex, political fights. Karen is a physical being who uses dark magic to make herself a digital form, she's a genuinely good-if-moody person with a legitimately horrifying "naked ghost woman" appearance that wants what's best for her boyfriend, and her abilities are themed around making things completely out of nothing; her army doesn't get along too much with <em>her,</em> but they do get along quite well with one-another and Unitia Two, and are often in total agreement and unison with one-another. Hell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that her hair color was picked because it's the inversion of .GIFfany's, with Unitia Two (with the inversion of <em>that</em>) pretty much having her same hair color as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>: Her permanent nudity and shapely figure might be nice, but then she starts growing tons of mouths and eyes and messily eats any supervillain that pisses her off, and uses her magic to make fake-ants pour out of her. As Carlson can attest to, she is genuine fanservice when she's around people she likes, but she can quickly becomes <em>nasty</em> when up against a threat. Carlson, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">Nightmare Fetishist</a>, still loves her no matter what form she takes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>: Carlson is the only other main character, and the only character in general, who enjoys her company. Stella tries to be nice with her but Karen frankly doesn't want to be anywhere around her, and their relationship gets <em>considerably</em> worse from the end of the Blast and the Past Arc to near the end of the You'll Like Arc. Eldbrash feels that he <em>owes</em> her one for saving his life (multiple times) but he's still scared shitless of her, and he fails to realize that what she really wants him to do is just leave him alone. Even Unitia Two and her aren't chummy for a bulk of the story, with both of them having vastly different ideas on how to have a proper relationship with someone like Carlson.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>: The most morally-adjusted of the main characters and also the biggest jerk of them in general.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>: She's either a downplayed version of this or some sort of deity. It's never made completely clear if Shadebows are supposed to be some kind of universal constant cosmic terror of a species or something sent by the gods and the closest thing <em>Blessed, Unfortunately</em> has to angels. (Last's species <em>look</em> like angels and Fred's <em>look</em> like demons, but they certainly are not.) Either way, she fits this, even being surreal compared to other Shadebows: between her whole "spiritual" form
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>: It takes a <em>lot</em> for that heart to uncover itself, but when it does, she can easily be one of the most genuine heartfelt of the cast. It also helps that she ironically has the cleanest moral compass and she's the only one of the main characters who wants to defeat the Eighth Circle for <em>truly</em> selfless reasons. (Carlson's just looking for a challenge, Stella just wants the fame, Unitia Two just wants this to blow over so she can have sex in peace, the other Unitias seem to feel about the same way, and even Eldbrash seems more concerned with mastering the "secrets of water" than he does with saving humanity, and he implied he wouldn't have even gone on the journey if it wasn't for Karen saving his life.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">Multi-Armed and Dangerous</a>: She can grow just about any body part but her favorite is arms. Lots and lots of arms when she <em>really</em> means business and <em>really</em> wants someone dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During her "yandere phase," she did that <em>far</em> more often and usually had those arms acting as a kind of "cover," the closest she had ever gotten to wearing clothes unless one counts her going under blankets in beds or using towels to dry off.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl">Shameless Fanservice Girl</a>: She and every single one of her Shades goes around completely naked at all times. <em>All</em> times. Not "sorta-naked" like in underwear/a bikini/some other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> suit, not "technically naked" in the sense that they "wear" something not made out of traditional clothing material, and as the story goes out of its way to emphasis despite being prose not even nudity covered with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair">Godiva Hair</a>, her own magic, or anything else, and she's not inhumanoid enough to "get away with it" &mdash; she goes out full-frontal at all times, and has spent her whole life like that. Luckily for her it's legal by 2060. The closest she gets to wearing clothes is that she still (rarely, most of the time she just makes flames to burn the water off, if not skipping showering completely by using flames to burn any filth off) dries herself with a towel, goes under sheets when sleeping, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she was less-heroic she grew multiple arms and used them to form a fake-"dress,"</span> but all three of these happened pretty rarely. The story's pretty quick to not make much of a big deal of her nudity
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringyHairedGhostGirl">Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl</a>: Not a ghost or any form of undead but otherwise looks the part, with a seagreen-tinted wash over herself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinyGuyHugeGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinyGuyHugeGirl">Tiny Guy, Huge Girl</a>: Carlson's not "tiny" but Karen's still taller than him by at least a head.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">Violently Protective Girlfriend</a>: Oh, Carlson doesn't <em>need</em> protection, given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">Saitama-levels</a> of invincible strength combined with his ridiculous water powers. He can handle himself, and in a vacuum if you try to piss him off, you don't have to worry about him. Outside of a vacuum, if you try to piss him off, you have to worry about <em>Karen,</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>: Her first fight with Yuullieke/Lucy is the first battle in the story that she unambiguously <em>loses,</em> not counting her sparring matches with Carlson or Assily Blast retreated in their first fight. Bear in mind that she helped fight Flare Speed and Assily Blast (and Swinging Blade, but he barely counts) and is even the reason why Carlson could beat the latter, proving that it wasn't unthinkable that she could take on an Infernal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like Yuullieke herself</span>. It's also the first time in the entire story that various Shades of hers "die," including and starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Unitia Two,</a></em> although they can escape to the Generator in spirit/digital form and regenerate from there in about a week. Seeing Lucy "one-punch" her in one of most monstrous-looking forms while Lucy herself has a big smile on her face is meant to come off as <em>extremely</em> unsettling because of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The rematch is far more successful.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Yuullieke:</strong> This is the part where you panic. You <em>thought</em> you could just get mad and win. Finally save your "boyfriend" by beating me up. Now you see that I'm a Chosen, a Reincarnation, a Blessed, and I'm not the kind of person you can kill in a blind rage. Your anger turned in to fear, you're surrounded by all of your own corpses. Which gets worse as you think the Power of Numbers will get you out of this. Tell me, how many Shades do you think it will take? A million? Billion? Trillion? Septillion? It doesn't matter. Compared to me, you're, well, nothing! And anything times nothing is still nothing! <br><strong>Carlson:</strong> Y-yeah. K-K-Karen, remember when we sparred... she's like me.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: Her hair is a dark sea-green. Her eyes, nails, and even <em>blood</em> match this too. Apparently all "base" Shadebows/first Shades have her hair/eye/blood color scheme, and their second Shades always have a pink scheme to compliment it, but the "colors" of other Shades after that are random.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>: You'd be dead wrong if you assume that she does this with her Shades. No, just <em>one</em> Unitia is good enough to stand on her own against a supervillain. She only has a huge crowd of them attack someone if they're powerful (like an Infernal or another A-level or above threat [that's another thing this might adopt a similar tier system that <em>Intriguing Group</em> has that's just kind of a copy of <em>One Punch Man</em> except both heroes and villains use letters instead of just heroes using letters and villains using animal/monster names]) or she <em>really</em> doesn't like them.

<ul><li> The earliest chapters/Prologue of <em>-Roy</em> implied that spells worked much more differently, having abstract rules and powers more inline with other fantasy series. There was more emphasis on spells that forced people to tell the truth, command others to do as said, and requirements for casting those spells seemed very strict, with things like the demon transfer "requiring" a full moon. The hoops that the Kabus Legion needed to jump through to bring themselves back to life were similarly implied to be astronomic. Around the beginning of Season 1 this slowly shifted in to more of Water's usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> system in things like <em>Blessed, Unfortunately</em>, where "magic" was this sort of fundamental self-replicating "substance" that was mainly used to make matter and could rarely be used for other things, and a majority of spells were some variation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>. The "old magic" couldn't just go away (not just because Fan hates it when a story brushes off its earlier, odder quirks to its magic system like it just never had them in the first place, but many of those spells went in to Roy being sealed with the Kabus Legion, and Joy with the Syulk Legion, so they're important to the plot) so it sticks out like a sore thumb when it or things <em>like</em> it come up.

Another route/timeline pair ends with the universe itself breaking down, but the heroes escaping by "leaving canon." While this is the most open-ended of the three endings, the fact that it's a metaphysical "escaping the story's world"-type ending symbolizes that if we <em>do</em> see them again, it won't be the "regular" UPOIC any more. The last ending is the happiest, and <em>seems</em> like it should be some sort of And The Adventure Continues type of deal, but it has a Distant Finale after all the main characters have either died in battle or of old age, the last shot of that is their memorial building with their tombstones clearly visible in the back.</span> Unlike the first two games, there is <em>no</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> or direct hint that "maybe we'll see more of UPOIC after all," unless one counts that two out of three of the endings <em>didn't</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have everybody (except Margaret, who teleported to a different timeline) die</span>. Water outright said that not only is he not too big of a fan of piling on sequels (he prefers single, but <em>long</em> stories instead of series with multiple consecutive installments; <em>Joy+Roy</em> is an exception because apart from <em>Epilogue</em> being at the end the three stories can be read in any order, and <em>Unviewable</em> was an exception because the games were mostly just "testing grounds" so that Water didn't have to come up with as many new characters), but he doesn't really want to become that sort of person who always says that there's a "last update" or "the final part" of a story and then goes back to it anyway, so he made it as difficult as possible to follow the temptation to continue <em>Unviewable</em>. That, and he was exhausted with <em>3</em> anyway.

Yes, her own organization doesn't <em>genuinely</em> believe in the same things she does, the Virtues and Etabed are just all hypocrites looking for an excuse to gather an anti-demon army, meaning that she spends the whole story being played like a fiddle. Yes, she continues being played even in <em>Epilogue</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Etabed outright tells her that he's basically the exact kind of person she'd hate if he wasn't a god, and then abandons her to get killed by Team Syulk-Kabus while he fights Pumpkin</span>. Yes, she's anti-sexuality and anti-nudity in a story with a heavy focus on sex and nudity, so it's obvious that her viewpoint is not the author's. Which makes it all more surprising when Roxy says something that actually <em>makes sense.</em> Her [I'll need to think about some of the other stuff later.] Her biggest hit is in Season 5 when she flat-out asks the world if they want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">their next generations</a> to grow up to be like Daygelz, and she says they would if they were in a world where sex and nudity weren't treated "as that big of a deal." Even though the question was not aimed at Daygelz, it was still a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a> for her; Daygelz was in one of her lowest moments at the time and <em>seriously</em> felt terrible about herself, and knew she didn't want anybody else to feel like she was at the moment. Finally, she's smart enough to catch on to Lesuif's "imposing human-hating ruler" being an act and she's only faking it just as part of a bizarre <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTestOfCharacter">Hidden Test Of Character</a> to ensure that the Kabus Legion would change, and she's right in saying that it's not very healthy and she's a <em>terrible</em> legion leader because of that, as legions/hosts are supposed to be about honesty and unity. (Although her accusing Lesuif of being a deliberate, malicious abuser wasn't right.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was that he wanted to write a character in a way that almost <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">feels</a></em> like she's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">glorifying</a></em> prudishness and yet it's obvious from her horrible actions and the story's over-the-top explicit nature that she's meant to be the bad guy, and anybody who agrees with her on everything wouldn't actually read <em>Joy+Roy</em> except out of extreme spite. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a> that still has her moments of being in the right, and "sympathy" when we look at things strictly from her point of view.
</li><li> Etabed is <em>shockingly</em> good at reading people for a guy who is a deconstruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Dogged Nice Guy</a> trope. He's actually pretty spot-on when he says that Roy is just "[him] waiting to happen;" Roy himself admits that had he not had at least Ashley in his life to occasionally keep his ego in check, he'd probably turn in to an entitled asshole, and we see various "Evil Roys" (most of which were imagined by him and brought to life by psychic-related powers, especially in Season 5, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> could make up entire mind worlds and generate them in real life) that bear striking similarities to Etabed in terms of personality. Heck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the main villains of <em>-Roy</em> and <em>Joy|</em> and their Dragons could be seen as <em>like</em> foils to the main humans and their demon patrons if they hadn't met their respective friends or the legion<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1sph0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1sph0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1sph0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically, the "gods" are foils to the human leads of that story, and their Dragons are the foils of the demon companions of the <em>opposite</em> story. Roxy is like Nightfirma in that they're both stoic "fun policers" with a light theme and who devotedly follow a deity-like figure that cleary doesn't share their viewpoints. Joxy is like an exaggeration of Daygelz's teasing-ness and trollish habitats, but twisted in to outright sadism. Pumpkin shares Joy's "Why not be more efficient and let what's best work?" mindset, but exaggerated to social darwinism levels. And there's Etabed and Roy, both being people who see themselves as heroes to women everywhere and having egoes so large that they can't admit their own faults, </span>, but the Roy-Etabed foil is the only one where the hero was actually in danger of becoming even close to as bad as the villain.

When President Drygate randomly decides to call her just to give a thanks, it's entirely reasonable to think that it's some kind of scammer. After all, what the <em>hell</em> kind of completely random citizen would get a personalized phone call from the President himself out of the blue, and just to say thanks at that? She assumes it's a recording, but then pushes her luck by threatening to hack in to his life and harm his family. In Seal 11, Daygelz ends up taking this trope apart with her, by telling her own audience that even if someone does make a few genuine points you agree with, that doesn't really mean you should blindly listen to them, especially if the "points" are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousAesop">incredibly obvious.</a> (Roy ends up learning this exact same lesson around the same time, but in a different place under different circumstances.)
<div class="indent"><strong>Daygelz:</strong> Alright, show of hands &mdash; and I <em>ONLY</em> want what <em>YOU</em> think, I don't want to hear any sass about people outside this building &mdash; being morbidly obese is bad for your health.

It's almost inarguable that he's short-tempered and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, but his argument that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption">Violence Is the Only Option</a> has <strong>some</strong> merit to the protagonists &mdash; every single Virtue, Sin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> is <em>killed</em> outright by the heroes, and while they have a good track record of sparing nameless mooks and lower-ranking and even mid-ranking members of the evil organizations, they tend to at least rough them up first. The story says that Team Syulk-Kabus aren't hypocrites for condeming Sam's assassination plans yet killing the major villains because the Team explicitely <em>only</em> kills people who either have a long history of genocide (the Virtues in particular are the reason why the Chartreuse Class of demons had a period of time where they were near-extinction. Yes, in both worlds, because long ago several of them crossed in to Perp and killed plenty of the Chartruse demons <em>there</em> too) and/or are so overwhelmingly powerful and stuck with their plan to kill the Team that talking them out of it is simply <em>not</em> an option, and neither is so much as capturing them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21uqv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21uqv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21uqv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">their <em>spirits</em> are captured since they lack the extra magic behind the Power Speedos, Godhood, or Pacts, but this can only be done <em>after</em> killing them</span>. Sam on the other hand wanted to kill pretty much anyone who was even <em>slightly</em> against him in any way whatsoever, and basically nuke the whole country aside from his group, which only consists of three people.

<p><em>Joy+Roy</em> is a series of Fictionpress action/comedy/romance/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi">ecchi</a> stories by Great Pikmin Fan. It is primarily made up of two long stories set in different worlds that run "parallel" to each other, but other sorts of spinoffs and side material have been planned, at least one of which being a formal crossover between the two that acts as an epilogue to the saga. Both of the "main" stories, <em>-Roy: Master of Debate</em> and <em>Joy|: Cunning Underling</em>, are set in their world's New York and detail groups of humans who wind up getting pulled in to an adventure by a much bigger group of demons.
</p><p>One of the two main stories, the first published, is <em>-Roy</em>. Roy himself is a hard-working secretary in a highly successful delivery company. On Halloween of 2018, which is also his 24th birthday, he covers for a quick delivery that leads him on a long drive through the middle of nowhere on his way back home. On this drive, his car happens to break down while he's in the wilderness, but thankfully his neighbor and "trustworthy friend" Roxy "just so happened" to have been right behind him at the time. While waiting for assistance, Roy and Roxy are attacked by a demonic, bird-looking phantom that turns out to be a projection by the powerful demon known as Lesuif, leader of the Kabus Legion. This attack also results in the entire Kabus Legion being sealed inside of Roy, something he does not fully know until he ends up releasing Daygelz, their designated messanger and the weakest of the group. Daygelz tells Roy &mdash; and pulls in his three only other friends, Evelin, Ashley, and Mindy &mdash; that demons had been the underdogs of the Solar System throughout history at the mercy of the angels that really run the place, and the humans used as their pawns. The Kabus Legion's goal is to take over a mysterious group of angel supremacists known as the Order of Chaos, who are also trying to resurrect their god Etabed, and take over all of humanity, turning Earth in to a demon-ran dystopian wasteland. After a particularly nasty attack from the Order while Roy was just doing his job, also revealing that Roxy is actually a member of them, Roy and his friends now decide to help the legion take down the Order, while also finding ways to convince them to maybe <em>not</em> put humanity under them. In a mental conversation, Lesuif agrees that she will not overpower humanity by the time of her release if <em>every</em> single member of the Kabus Legion decides against the plan. Said legion has <em>666 members,</em> divided in to 74 groups of 9, each group &mdash; "Squad" &mdash; represents a different "class" of demon, which have different powers. Lesuif is also set to be the final demon released, and gives the group until her release before she comes to a decision on what to do with humans. Complicating matters is that Lesuif herself is <em>significantly</em> more powerful than almost anyone else in the story, and that she and Etabed knew one-another back from high school.
</p><p><em>Joy|</em> is set on a "parallel" world &mdash; actually nicknamed the Perpendicular World &mdash; where angels and demons had revealed themselves to all of humanity shortly before what would have been World War I. Also, life and the colors of things and even people are slightly different in this world. And their "angels" look demonic and use dark magic more than light, while their "demons" look angelic and use light magic more than dark. Joy herself is an amateur "adventurer" &mdash; someone who goes out fulfilling easy quests and slaying weak monsters, RPG style &mdash; living with the slightly more experienced and serious adventurer Riscend as her roommate and friend with benefit. A few hours before Roy gets the Kabus demons sealed inside of him, the power in Joy and Riscend's neighborhood goes out. Riscend leaves to take on a quest, while Joy goes out to find out why it went out. Along the way, a clearly unnatural earthquake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic">(not that that's anything new to her)</a> reveals a cave with a massive sword in it &mdash; said sword holds the <em>Syulk</em> Legion, a team mostly consisting of lazy or amateur demons who are nowhere near as good at combat as the Kabus Legion. Their own messanger, Nightfirma, warns Joy that there's a conspiracy involving <em>their</em> world's god, the demon Pumpkin/the Master, is hatching a plan to single-handedly take over the world with the help of the Dackhark Shipping Corporation. Unlike the Kabus Legion, the Syulk Legion's members have been raised in a more demon-friendly environment and have no ill-will towards humans or angels. However, almost none of them actually believe they should even bother helping their own overpowered leader, Rhislaujja, stop the Dackharks and the Master. This <em>would</em> be fine in the eyes of everyone except Rhislaujja herself. Even she doesn't think that the other demons would <em>contribute that much,</em> but she instead believes that she should have an army composed of nine members of each demon class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>, and refuses to fight the Master without the combined might of the Syulk Legion or an equivalent band of demons. Thus, the challenge the humans of that group &mdash; Joy, Riscend, and friends Etinal and Skyther &mdash; have is giving the demons proper motivation. Oh yeah, and the Master's top assistant is Joxy, a mysterious masked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Monster Clown</a> robot of sorts.

<ul><li> Parallel Earth was basically "the real world" with angels and demons going around in the shadows and people being hammier and stupider than normal. Things went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> around 2012 (and no, this has nothing to do with the Mayan Calendar).

This ended up kicking off what would become half of the Order of Chaos' founders to team up with their first half, kickstarting the Order vs Kabus Legion plot of <em>-Roy: Master of Debate</em>. It's implied that in "our timeline," there were <em>still</em> ten people from the Colonial Age who had frozen themselves as part of the prior god's wishes; they'd remain frozen until female toplessness becomes legal throughout the whole country, and people protesting against that happen upon the chest containing the <em>second</em> message directing them to the frozen people. Also, Great Pikmin Fan in this world exists as the elusive author "NeedsMoreDeepWater," and his Fictionpress stores (except <em>Unviewable</em>) exist as mature animated series.

Fan hinted [I did not (typing this in the Sandbox doesn't count), I will before this page is out though] that there <em>were</em> mostly counterparts of people across each world before the Intersection, and for several obvious reasons the shock from finding out about the existence of angels and demons made people... behave quite differently, which snowballed in to different relationships forming, different people being born, and generations down "Perpendicular Roy" or "Parallel Joy" just flat-out not existing.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedElements">Color-Coded Elements</a>: Demon and angel classes are identified by color, it's the color of the person's hair and eyes, and the associated "magic."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: Almost every character is in <em>at least</em> pairs, some have multiple foils. The most obvious are the main four humans of each group: each of those humans has a counterpart across the two worlds, a counterpart in the Ninja/Suits Squad (and of course for the Ninja/Suits Squads, counterparts in the main gang with the legion), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">and a counterpart across the two worlds and in/out of their respective squad.</a> They all have their associated colors next to one-another on the color wheel, or at least without any colors of the "other groups" in-between them. To sum things up:
<ul><li> <strong>The "Yellow Humans"</strong> are Roy, Joy, Lilith, and the unknown "amber" leader of the Suits Squad. Roy is an uptight hard-worker who prefers staying out of trouble and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">isn't liked by others.</a> Joy is a social butterfly with plenty of friends who loves wrecklessly going out on adventures. Lilith shares Roy's devotion to hard work, but she's far more relaxed and formal than he is,
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>: In both worlds, demons are all-female. Angels are all-male.
</li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>-Roy: Master of Debate</em></h2>
<p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>:
<ul><li> We're introduced to Roy working hard when nobody else described at the beginning is, showing how seriously he takes his job and his general devoted, determined nature. But it's also clear nobody likes him. When his boss (reluctantly) sends him to cover for someone else, Roy comes across someone running a religious charity. Roy starts <em>trying</em> to chew the guy running the charity out for being religious, but fumbles over what he says a lot, remarks that it would be a lot easier doing that over Twitter, and then he awkwardly drives off without saying much further. Hinting that he's a know-it-all and can be a bit of a dick. His <em>insistence</em> that angels/gods don't exist is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a>, since the very first scene of the story (the Prior Vessel sealing the Kabus Legion) confrims that the supernatural exists, and the very premise is that this "ex-atheist" will get a huge number of demons sealed inside of him.
</li><li> Evelin has two. First, she's seen working on something when Roy calls her asking for help, and then she leaves their appartment... by diving out her window and parachuting to her car. And most of her gear during this involves swords. So, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">cloudcuckoolander</a> inventor with a fixation on weapons. Her second one is in the next chapter, where she rides a motorcycle up to where Roy and the White Squad are, cuts a shadow ball in half, and then casually walks right up to Hyumultahs, who is five-stories tall and resembles an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelicAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelicAbomination">Angelic Abomination</a>, casually.
</li><li> Ashley is first seen casually relaxing on the couch of her, Eve, and Roy's apartment without pants. When Eve jumps out the window and leaves, Ash barely even bats an eye and doesn't seem to care too much, shrugging and figuring that Eve could handle saving Roy and Roy could handle being on his own, and she's right. Later in the same chapter, after Daygelz is finished explaining the story behind the Order of Chaos, Ashley is the only one who outright says how stupid she thinks it sounds. Rather bluntly, too. Unsurprisingly, she's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> of the group.
</li><li> On her introduction, Mindy
</li><li> Daygelz is introduced in the Mind Hub dive-bombing between Lesuif's legs just to deny Roy a view of her with those legs spread out. She casually and calmly explains Roy's alien situation, <em>sort of,</em> and then lies to him saying that if he gets closer, she'll move out of the way. She then pounces him and threatens to claw his eyes out, suddenly becoming <em>vicious.</em> That's a good summation of Daygelz; she's way less alien and eldritch than Lesuif behind her (speaking in English in contrast to Lesuif's insistence on using Decetongue even though she knows Roy doesn't understand her),
</li><li> When Azmelditas pops out in spirit form, she seems like the friendliest captain yet up to that point, happily greeting and giving positive remarks to the gang, aside from Roy. (Who she dislikes because of his personality, but frankly so do the rest of the gang.) Then she cheerfully says that she is full support of Lesuif's plan to take over humanity once the latter is out, and says in a casual manner that just about the only thing convincing her that humanity is worth joining the fight against the Order and other angel-supremacists is if they kill Hyumulahs. That gigantic, elite angel warrior who even Daygelz is scared of.
</li><li> Lesuif's proper introduction is also in the Mind Hub. She emerges from the shadows on a throne atop an obsidian mountain that Roy dreams himself on, she's at least twice his size, and she refuses to talk to him in anything other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech">Black Speech</a>, despite knowing English and knowing that Roy can't understand her. This sets her up as intimidating, powerful, and demonic. Then she very bluntly asks, in English, if Roy wants to have sex with her. The end of the Prologue has a second, "actual" moment for Lesuif when the reader gets a look in to her head when Daygelz talks about abandoning the "take over humanity" plan; she's <em>thrilled</em> about it. Her thoughts sound <em>completely</em> unlike how Lesuif had been presenting herself in prior, showing that in spite of her sheer demonic power, her "evil dark lord" thing was just an act and she's actually more of a dork than that. And friendlier. In-between those moments she also helps Roy out and telepathically tells him outright that she never really hated humanity, she just wanted her friends (the rest of the legion) to feel happy, but at the same time that part doesn't really <em>show</em> until the end of the Prologue.
</li><li> Roy had known Roxy for six years and had generally trusted her as a friend. But then Roxy turns out to be a part of the Order of Chaos at the end of Seal 0 Part 1. Well, is Roy going to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYoureInThereSomewhereFight">"I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight</a> with her and try to get her to join the Kabus Legion team? Seal 0 Part 2 puts a <em>serious</em> dent in that when she shows up in Roy's workplace, gets Roy to come out, and casually tries to shoot him in the face without even saying a word<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qs58');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3qs58" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qs58');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She <em>did</em> say "Welcome to the Order of Chaos, motherfucker" originally, but Fan cut this as he felt it was <em>wildly</em> out of character for her</span>. No, she's actually a terrible possible-sociopath and a sound aversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?</a> This also doubles as one to the Order of Chaos as a whole, showing that they're <em>easily</em> more evil than the Kabus Legion and the <em>real</em> villains of this story, being ruthless murderers in contrast to Daygelz's hammier but much more affable and less violent performance.
</li><li> Up until Hyumultahs' introduction, Daygelz had always been portrayed as a fearless badass who had effortlessly curb-stomped any enemies before her. So it's obvious that when he rumbles the ground and <em>Daygelz</em> reacts in fear, saying "I know that rumble," and then completely flips, this is <em>not</em> some fodder like the Order of Chaos Soldiers a second ago. The first part of him Roy sees and is described to the viewer is his speedo-clad crotch, as he's a giant and he happens to emerge from a point where his groin is at level with the building, setting up the first of many jokes about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis">Gag Penis</a>. He lifts the building with his <em>foot</em> and throws it high in the air, giving a good idea of how powerful he is. When he's finally "seen" in full and starts getting chattier, one of the first things he does is mock Daygelz for crying at the sight of him and telling her to kill herself, establishing him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">a complete fucking asshole</a> compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">the more teasing Daygelz.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeTwist">First-Episode Twist</a>:
<ul><li> Roxy working with the Order of Chaos is a major twist at the end of the very first chapter. Said first chapter sets her up as part of "Roy's Gang" and even teases her as a potential love interest, possibly even one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a> as she's the only one of Roy's four friends who doesn't walk in on him talking to the demons. Nope, she's not just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretSecretKeeper">Secret Secret-Keeper</a>, she knew about demons and angels <em>more</em> than any of the other main humans had, and she's one of the major villains. As she goes on to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> for the whole story, Fan barely hides this, and even lists her with the Order of Chaos on his profile.
</li><li> Daygelz having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> very early on and Lesuif turning out to be a huge-dork <em>personality-wise</em> (but she is <em>not</em> slacking in terms of <em>power</em>) that never really hated humanity, but just went against them because she thought it would make her friends happy, were large developments of the Prologue. Daygelz would go on to become the "main demon" and be an ally with more screentime than Roy's human friends, while Lesuif's character just becomes an easily-known part of the rest of the story.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentCohabitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentCohabitation">Innocent Cohabitation</a>: At first. In the beginning of the story, Roy lives in an apartment with Evelin and Ashley, and he even shares a bed with the latter. (This is because they could only afford two beds, and sleeping like that is considered <em>less</em> awkward than either of them sleeping with Eve, whom they both have a rather one-sided crush on.) The three of them all knew one-another since childhood, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> is still brought up here and there. Ironically the first of the humans in his group that he ends up sleeping with is also the only one of the three that he isn't living with. It has been confirmed that Roy will end up sleeping with Ashley and Evelin sooner or later, "sooner" for Ash's part and "later" for Eve's.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils">Lesser of Two Evils</a>: This kicks off the main plot. The four humans are caught between the Kabus Legion and the Order of Chaos, and at full, each of their leaders could potentially end the whole world, leading to demons or angels to dominate humanity (and the other species). However, while the Kabus Legion aren't <em>harmless</em> by any stretch of the imagination, they are much less violent, more reasonable, and more agreeable than the Order of Chaos, and they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> and a relatively noble goal that the Order lacks. So, the humans are trying to gain the friendship of the Kabus Legion, while the Order of Chaos are just genocidal assholes who attack the gang completely unprovoked and are only in this for themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">Rewatch Bonus</a>: Roxy's behavior in the first chapter makes <em>much</em> more sense after reading the chapter's ending and finding out that she not only knew about angels and demons, she was part of the Order of Chaos. [FUCK I never actually told this and did a <em>really</em> bad job at <em>conveying</em> it.] Her being behind Roy wasn't a coincidence, she managed to pin-point where the Kabus Legion was sealed and was checking on them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesEstablishingMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesEstablishingMoment">Series Establishing Moment</a>: Great Pikmin Fan says that the <em>intended</em> establishing moment is the White Squad's battle against the sex traffickers in Seal 0 Part 2. The fight was meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> towards the cliche of love interests, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">especially if they're supposed to be powerful fighters,</a> being easily overpowered by random nameless bullies/thugs/rapists and needing to be saved by the male lead. The White Squad is said to be the weakest of the Kabus Legion, and Daygelz herself is the weakest of the entire group. Yet even <em>they</em> completely curb-stomp and humiliate them while barely even taking the fight seriously. Roy <em>does</em> catch a glimpse of the fight &mdash; specifically the aftermath, with "Well Man" having had his teeth knocked out, been forced to wear a pink thong, with a pole shoved up his ass, and both dirty messages written on him and a spell that forces him to confess to cops &mdash; and he's horrified, showing that he's nowhere <em>near</em> as and certainly not more powerful than the demons. It's an early indicator that the Kabus Legion are not going to be helpless damsels in distress, Roy's far from a knight in shining armor hero, and this isn't your typical harem comedy by a long shot. When Daygelz <em>does</em> appear to be traumatized by Hyumultahs a bit later, it's because Hyumultahs is clearly much more powerful than some random criminal gang and it's meant to show that he's a major villain. Also, while <em>Evelin</em> plays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment and saves Daygelz and her squad, <em>Roy</em> is just as scared and cowering as Daygelz. A "main lead sums up his courage and will fight a seemingly impossible enemy to save his girl" story this ain't.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">Wham Shot</a>: In the first chapter, Daygelz describes the Order of Chaos' logo in detail &mdash; a question mark made out of several small straight lines. At the end of the chapter, <em>Roxy</em> pulls out a remote with that same insignia on it. Up until that point she was built up as being another one of the love interests, if an especially cold-hearted one, but it turns out she's one of the villains, and knew about angels and demons the entire time.

<p>Also it kinda shits on a lot of cliches and conventions. Like basically it <em>is</em> a "harem series" with one guy and a shitload of women but holy fuck, the one guy is <em>not</em> a power fantasy by any real stretch, at least not for the bulk of the story:
</p><ul><li> Roy, the MC of the Parallel World's story, is an annoying douchebag. And no, not like in the sort of "cool bad boy rebel" way, or in the edgy "hurr hurr hurr is he really the 'hero?!' well he is to people who like to fantasize about being all degerate and shit" but in the "nerd asshole who complains about petty shit and strokes his ego constantly" way. He's written to be purposefully <em>unlikeable.</em> By pretty much anyone in the story's target audience. He gets a lot better through just the first arc, but by the beginning he's awful...
</li><li> ...And yet he still gets laid anyway, more than the usual harem protagonist. So, like, sick and tired of the "wimpy" MC
</li><li> Daygelz ain't some kinda moeblob by a longshot. Like, she's introduced being all sexually explicit and unnerving and generally a bit of a jerk. None of this is an act. She's not one of those characters who <em>talks</em> all about sex and stuff but then flips the shit out on

<p>The worst thing is looking in to his notes <em>Zeksmit</em> could have been decent, like on paper it didn't sound too bad. A fantasy AU-reboot thing of <em>Total Drama</em> where only a few of the characters knew each-other, it was focused on dynamics between characters who rarely interacted, it goes out of its way to try not to either paint Courtney (or other characters but Courtney's the most important one frankly) as an innocent angel nor a horrid, tantrum-throwing monster but instead as a flawed person who gets better with a weird friendship with Lindsay and Beth of all people, and there's a plot about Izzy being mature... you could also tell even from what <em>was</em> written that even back in 2011 Water wanted to take Bridgette/Izzy <em>seriously,</em> like, an actual relationship and not OmG yOu GuYs SeXy LeSbIaNs HAWT. Future seasons would go more and more in to the fantasy elements and there was a nonet of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a> (seven "regular" elements (air, fire, earth, lightning, plants, water, "poison"), animal-themed powers, and undead-themed powers; and people without powers) with vaguely-thought out rules and weaknesses and stuff and there were "themed" groups of people, like full-on cities and stuff in the volcanos with fire-people, deep-sea ones with water people, etc. And fuck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers">Personality Powers</a>, the surfer Bridgette had fire powers, Gwen's the one with water powers and her blue hair is natural and a sign of that,
</p><p>But like the <em>execution</em> was a complete mess. It couldn't decide if it wanted to focus more on character or fantasy, so it went with the former... but like over time, it kind of abruptly and jarringly killed off its fantasy elements but kept the setting. The challenges made no sense whatsoever. Izzy's character arc is a rather abrupt 180 from her being all goofy and stuff to completely changing her personality just to appease Bridgette, all for a rather bizarre and stupid decision on her part. And then instead of going back and fixing it Water just had a "special" that ended with him killing Ezekiel off.
</p><p>Frankly this showed all the warning signs of some of the problems in <em>Joy+Roy</em> (although to his credit it's way worse in TZ, so, he improved?): way too many concepts spitballed together,
</p><p></p></div>
<p>Originally the Ninja and Suit Squads were going to stick around with the Order/Joxy until about Season 4, and just kinda stay stagnant apart from the whole "keeping Amanda as a sort of prisoner" thingy in <em>-Roy</em> Season 3 (that part was mostly unchanged), but I got the idea to have Roxy fire the Ninjas at the end of Season 1 from Prince Zuko's whole arc. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He starts out with his own ship and small Fire Nation crew in Book 1, then he loses that once he's exposed as the Blue Spirit and in Book 2 he's off with just him and Iroh</span>. So, if you liked that the Ninjas were only in the Order for a little bit and then got their own B-plot, and were clearly their "own party" and not just quirky extentions of the Order for half the story, you can thank <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> for that.

</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Blessed, Unfortunately</em>:
<ul><li> Canada, which took over most of the world in this story's timeline, has six major cities of note: Hill Town, in North America (by where Canada was prior to it becoming most of Earth); Watch City in Asia (our world-Japan); Cooper Domain in South America (our world-Brazil); Joshina Fortress in Africa (our world-Egypt); Hellguy "Village" in Europe (our world-United Kingdom); and the Quartz Market in the center of Australia. All six of these had gigantic coliseums built in the name of the Six Lesser Ones, and they all form the largest headquarters for Canada's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesRUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesRUs">hero organizations.</a> Hill Town is the main city, it's a decently-sized city in the middle of a forest with tons of factories and canyons on the outskirts, which was all formed out of a giant crator from a war with aliens a few years back. All five of the main characters (the Knights) live here and it's <em>also</em> where the Fabrics, the most major hero group outside of the Knights, operate. Watch City is a much "flashier," Vegas-esque entertainment center and an even bigger metropolis where Team G4M3R, the Inventor, and Henfight live/opperate, and it has a fair share of secondary characters as well. The other four cities, on the other hand, have much less relevance outside of their arcs where the heroes go there (and even then, Hill Town gets <em>three</em> arcs, while Hellguy Village and Quartz Market have to share one, and it's one of the <em>shortest</em> arcs), despite featuring more exotic designs as they go on: Cooper Domain (which can basically be described as a gigantic, futuristic water park-like city) houses AweZome and... a few other bit heroes, but that's about it. Joshina Fortress (the ruins of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> out in the middle of the desert that was rebuilt in to a city), Hellguy Village (a place that's horizontally the smallest of the six cities, but it's a <em>tall</em> set of vaguely gothic-looking towers and a vertical labyrinth) and the Quartz Market (basically a gigantic religious center ) don't even have a "main" hero to their name,

It's the one part of the game where you don't have access to the hub &mdash; it's a mostly-linear path <em>leading</em> to that hub, but you need to fight enemies and solve puzzles and the like before it.

Once you get access to the Capital and get a better item shop, and equipment shop, an inn, learn the Trio Attacks, and get more Duo Attacks as the game progresses, the game becomes significantly easier.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was an actual, honest-to-goodness villain with no positive traits and had a generic motive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. From the game onward a major guideline for writing the stories set in the verse is that we don't see any characters who are truly, completely pure evil and don't have some kind of nicer side to them. This started because of the criticism the antagonist got.
</li><li> Said villain was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. In <em>Siblings of Sanity</em>,

Marilyn still had her skimpy leotard, but the first two chapters had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of always having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor">carefully-placed objects covering the rear of it,</a> all while a bunch of other characters remarked in shock of just how much of her ass is hanging out, the joke being that in no panel could we <em>see</em> it for ourselves. (<em>This</em> is another piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> as later on nobody bats an eye at revealing costumes or even total nudity, in fact we see <em>royalty</em> dining with crazy, naked old men (plural) at their table as guests.) Given that this comic would feed in to the same game that pushes the boundaries of a T rating and feature nipples-but-not-really, it's almost unfathomable that it would refuse to show the reader a butt, let alone a butt that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThongOfShielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThongOfShielding">technically</a> clad in something.

The Siblings now have a truck instead of/in addition to their motorcycle and are seen standing on top of it, surrounded by mooks clawing at the base. Behemoth and Leviathan looked the same (but their expressions implied that their personalities were more threatening) but all four of the "humanoid" demons had some changes. The Dealer has a mask over half his face and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UhOhEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UhOhEyes">"Uh-Oh" Eyes</a> with several red and white rings. Fallen looked mostly the same, except with giant gaping holes in the place of her eyes and mouth. Trickster was much bigger and had a goatee and what looked like a visible dong, but otherwise looked the same. And finally, Legion, whose <em>bodies</em> stayed the same but her <em>heads</em> looked like twisting trees. This was a remnant before the "no completely terrible villains" rule struck, the demons were going to be more of a generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> lead by a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>, instead of what they ended up being. Also, the truck never appears in-game.

All three of them have dead-serious looks on their faces as they ramp up, and appear as silhouettes in the sky behind the moon. And said moon looks like its "bottom" was blown off. And there's two more, smaller moons orbitting it. Welcome to <em>Siblings of Sanity</em>, an out-there and over-the-top game that's also definitely <em>not</em> on Earth.

Between the city, forest, and the lake is a swamp Chapter 5 is set in, and it's mapped out so that it believably fits. Chapter 1 is set in the plains, Chapter 2 in a deeper, less-populated part of the city few dare enter, and Chapter 4 is by a pit that was created from a meteor impact ages ago, then set in a chamber later. The only "oddball" is that Chapter 3 starts out in a factory and then leads to an area <em>made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatMoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatMoss">Meat Moss</a>,</em> with said "meaty" region apparently being a natural geographic feature in their world.

</li><li> The Pirates, But Not Really DLC on the other hand plays this straighter. It's set in the neighboring lake, and there are four <em>major</em> islands of note that act as "chapters," all of which are closer to typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameSettings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameSettings">Video Game Settings</a> than the regions in the vanilla game or the Harder Demons DLC.

The <em>execution</em> on the other hand squarely puts it here: a lot of over-the-top random shit and slapstick happening, the monsters having absurd designs, things like a cave made out of flesh and bone being seen as a <em>normal setting</em> in their verse (although there's lore behind the flesh caves &mdash; yes, plural), and the frequent nudity of people of all shapes, sizes, and age (but seemingly being more common the older one is, and being <em>very</em> common with the elderly, to the point where finding an old NPC that's not naked is... rare) that nobody bats an eye at. Someone unfamiliar with the game getting their first impression off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> summed it up as this: "If you're familiar with pop culture you can just <em>tell</em> if something is 'Japanese' or 'American' by looking at it.

Yes I know it was developed by Americans but it sure as shit doesn't feel like it."

Then the game came out and most comments are drooling over the magician-demon in the shorts, the completely naked flirty purple man, the also naked, nipple-outlined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> woman, or the charming and genuinely likable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who technically gets stripped down to his underwear after he's beaten in battle. Many people who enjoy fanworks and the like are unfamiliar that not only does the game has its <em>strong</em> fair share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>, but the creator is also notorious for making a lot of grossout webcomics in the past, with his most known unrelated to the <em>Sanity</em> series being about a decet of aliens who have built their home on the assfat of a disgusting, overweight, middle-aged hairy man. Not to mention the plot, namely how it tries to avoid having any completely-hateable "pure evil" character and try to be morally gray instead. This is typically glossed over and just looked at as "the thing with the rainbow boob woman that's really 100 women in one."

<ul><li> Runes look almost like joke enemies, just being drawings of symbols on the ground that don't even move, but they're among the deadliest enemy type in the game and make the second half that much harder. All types of them have an annoying rapid-fire attack where they shoot their respective energy balls in quick succession at random siblings, and should a sibling get two or more in a row there's a <em>tiny</em> window to dodge them before being hurt again. Cursed Runes are the first of them in Chapter 4, they don't really have much except for their aformentioned powerful attacks. Then there's Yggdrasil Runes in Chapter 5, which come with massive vines and branches that make their attack even trickier. And finally, Horror Runes in Chapter 6, which make portals that place the siblings in different locations on the battlefield or just swap their places around, screwing <em>heavily</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">with your muscle memory.</a>

<ul><li> A good way to get skinned alive is to call Legion's bodies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">"Kage Bunshins"/"Shadow Clones" or saying that she uses "Kage Bunshin no Jutsu."</a> Not only was it agreed that of all the possible jokes to make about Legion, pop culture or otherwise, that one was beaten in to the ground the most and fastest, that's not even how her bodies work. They're not generated "clones" of her, they were all bodies born together that happen to share a same conciousness, they're not even "once-individual people joined together by the 'real' Legion." Even the developers themselves have commented that they disliked that joke thanks to overuse.
</li><li> Nicknaming Marty "Martyo" or "Marty-o" is generally agreed upon to be something only done by people who outright hate the game, newbies who barely understood what its gameplay was inspired by, or trolls. Yes, he is named after Mario. But it's really obvious. So much so that the nickname just feels more like stating the obvious,
</li><li> The only one that got the developers outright <em>angry</em> is spreading false "Japan vs USA" "version comparisons" of the game, especially pre-release. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Jimmy himself did this pre-release</a> by faking for an April Fool's joke that in the "censored version" (without specifying what region) Marilyn's leotard covers up much more of her rear, giving a side-by-side comparison. (Her leotard is a thong in all versions.) Some people took that out of context (the same post had a lot more, <em>far</em> more blatant jokes like an optional "Cat Mode" where the Sanitys have their heads replaced with cat heads, or a toilet boss with a deliberately terrible and basic-looking model that spews "crap" that's just solid brown spheres at you) and posted it by itself to bait others, and said others took it seriously and began raising hell over "censorship" that wasn't even real, not helping that pretty much everybody thought it was <em>their</em> country that was getting the censored version. Jimmy came to regret that and has openly said that <em>if</em> you want to complain about things like the CERO redesign of Legion that's fine, but please complain about censorship that <em>actually exists.</em>

This has caused a <em>second</em> split on whether criticising her look is bad since that was kind of the point, in the past she was ashamed of it and "hid" that body while her other 99 bodies would go out in public, she eventually learned to accept that "mutated" body and made it her "main" one.

I don't care about any of that" speech under a truth spell, confirming this &mdash; was to bring his daughter back to life. Like he did, they didn't care for the consequences of upsetting the balance between life and death, </span>. It helps that Dealer spends the <em>whole game</em> being genuinely likable, and even when he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> he doesn't really change

Yet even though Leviathan is the least-human-looking and on paper has the creepiest design out of the gang, the general reaction when meeting her is "Aww, I have to fight <em>her?</em>" Thanks to her cheery, friendly personality and how more of her traps and puzzles fail/backfire without the Sanitys doing anything than actually succeeding. She's also pretty much the only boss whose followup is <em>worse</em> than her personality-wise, with Legion technically being a gaslighter and a faint <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>, even if she's not too bad herself.

The few times the game pulls a tough puzzle on you (except for the Harder Demons dungeons, where it happens <em>all the time</em> thanks to those areas having far more difficult puzzles), her advice is extremely unhelpful and cryptic, or in the case of the last two Harder Demons dungeons she flat-out tells you she has no idea what hint to give. She's seen as not having much character beyond being overly whiny and crying too much in a game where the main leads are far more straight-faced badasses and already have a good dynamic going between them. She shares credit with the Sanitys for their achievements despite not really doing anything to help them, and story-wise she fits in poorly with the plot (you can remove her <em>entirely</em> and <em>nothing</em> would change). All of this is ignoring the elephant in the room, her "naked cherub-esque" design, which let's just say caused controversy and leave it at that. The backlash of her annoyingness being turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the first DLC lead to the developers to confirm that she won't be in the next two DLC campaigns (which unlike Harder Demons are not integrated to the main map/story and are set in completely new sub-regions with their own stories) at all unless explicitely called upon by the player for help, and that her advice will be more helpful.

<ul><li> This game's answer to Bros. Attacks are Duo and Trio Attacks, where Duo Attacks use a set amount of points per attack, and Trio Attacks are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>s that have their own gauge.

It helps that, aside from the beginning of the game refusing to introduce or explain anything like the Sanitys themselves, reading <em>A Brother and His Sisters</em> isn't required to understand anything about the game's world.

The original webcomic wasn't <em>terrible,</em> but it had rather flat and amateur art, couldn't decide if it wanted to be super serious or all-out silly, all three Sanitys were fairly one-note (Marty not even talking), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain">Generic Doomsday Villain</a> with a forgettable design, and it was very clearly "<em>Zelda</em> but with three oddball siblings as the heroes instead of a Link-expy."

It was going to go through the whole story, but Jimmy decided to drop it just a few pages in</span>) the criticism to heart, somehow assembled a team to turn his fairly non-standout webcomic in to a game, and he fixed most of the problems: the 3D models look <em>much</em> better and the prequel webcomic about Legion has a better artstyle to match, it firmly decided to be on the side of "goofy," the siblings grew an actual dynamic, Jimmy's response to being told that his villain was a generic evil was to go out of his way to plan a story where <em>nobody</em> was completely, pure evil, and the world got more of its identity rather than being the writer's favorite Nintendo (and some Microsoft and Sony) games mashed together.

<ul><li> Don't be fooled by Legion's true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>, kind of dorky nature you find out partway through Chapter 5. She can and will still kick your ass. Her battle has two phrases, <em>both</em> of which let her attack <em>three times in one turn,</em> a mechanic only seen prior with Leviathan attacking twice. First all 100 of her bodies are out at once and clumped on the field <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Dream World</a>-style, and must be hit with powerful multi-hit attacks that will beat them on the same turn. Otherwise, she'll spend her first move (but only her first move) with each of her KO'd bodies getting <em>fully</em> revived by a still-standing body, meaning you have to finish off <strong>fifty</strong> of them in one turn if you don't want an endless loop where none of them are defeated. Thankfully, you can weaken the individually... unless you're playing on Hard Mode, where standing bodies heal one-another too. If you <em>do</em> have the defeated bodies outnumber the still-standing bodies, the standing ones get pissed and start dealing more damage. Once Phase 1 is done, the bodies all form a giant pile together and share a lifebar, and she trades off being a "take out all the targets at once" gimmick in favor of hitting hard, <em>and she still has regen every first turn.</em> She can also inflict a while party-wide Immobilize, which is Stun/Frozen on steroids and has <em>no</em> gear that makes your party immune to it (and the gear that makes the Sanitys <em>resistant</em> to it is a very rare drop from a Chapter 5 enemy), which gives her an extra free three attacks plus however many she was doing before, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">during which you might as well just enter Windowed mode and close the game.</a>

<ul><li> The Quartet are the first of the extra DLC bosses and could be fought right after beating Chapter 1, and they have a silly pastel color scheme, so one might think they're the easiest, right? Wrong. They're considered the most ruthless by far. There's four of them, each with their own elemental resitances and weaknesses. [...] Holly, the white one, is by far the worst, being the healer of the team who will make sure they stay standing, <em>and</em> since she's a tank (she has the <em>highest</em> health and defense of the four) she'll keep herself standing pretty well too.

<ul><li> Chapter 5. The first half of it sees the Outskirts Swamp being blanketed with fog that reduces your visibility to almost nothing, and it's an extremely confusing maze littered with poison and slowing-mud, not helped by the fact that your standard interface game map is replaced by a vague drawing of the general area that gives you little to no indication of where you actually <em>are.</em> Once you read Legion's diary and she reveals her true nature, the fog of the swamp clears up and you've left with the second half. Also, you get a real map this time. Is it easier? Well yes, but barely, the enemies introduced in the later half are much tougher as you walk up a mountain to some random mansion (yes, you don't actually fight Legion in her house, there's a whole <em>different</em> spooky swamp house that acts as her arena instead), and Legion herself is absolutely not a pushover, as seen by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> entry.
</li><li> "Pirates" has Splash Island. Jimmy said he <strong>hates</strong> ice levels and refused to put any in the vanilla game, and while the Crystal Reflection from Harder Demons was considered okay (mostly because it lacked a lot of things other people hate about ice/snow levels, especially slippery surfaces), Splash Island is an outright nightmare. Dolphouls guard the lower, non-frozen areas and [...] Oh yeah, and since DLC 2's areas scale with player progression, no amount of grinding will save you.

<ul><li> The Demons got this to the point where Jimmy made them confirmed reocurring characters in potential future media instead of just one-offs like they were intended to be because he was afraid that by dropping them entirely for whatever sequel or followup he'd have "just taken lightning [he] caught in a bottle and threw that bottle in the toilet." While the first DLC didn't get any <em>flack</em> for not being a followup to the Demons, since the Demons themselves had minor roles in the plot and it was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Brutal Bonus Level</a> expansion than it was a new campaign, the Pirates But Not Really DLC took flack for its new storyline and set of villains not <em>nearly</em> being seen as interesting as the Demons themselves.

There is also <em>much</em> less grossout humor/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a> and more legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> than his norm. However, the original webcomic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a> status convinced him to shift gears a little, that and his relaxing standards on nudity in general. (The reason <em>why</em> he had so much grossout material was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at fanservice in general, ) Not only did it become his "main" series after the game's sheer explosion,

<ul><li> Amusingly, Jimmy absolutely <em>hates</em> Legion, for two reasons. [Originally this just had this sentence and then I forgot to add on to it. It made it look like it waas a dumb "the two reasons are each boob LOL" joke, which doesn't even make sense since technically Legion has 200 breasts.] One, he had a lot of trouble actually coming up with a design for her that he liked; he knew off the bat that she was going to be female and would have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> mechanic, right down to the 100 bodies, but he kept going around back and forth on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> scale (her original concept first seen in the "ending" of the <em>Brother and His Sisters</em> webcomic was that she'd have humanoid bodies but a twisted tree stump-like part in place of heads, at one point all her bodies would just be masses of tentacles, etc) and did a lot of touch-ups, and ultimately she had the <em>most</em> revisions out of <em>anybody</em> in the series, so he always associated her with being an exhausting task of finding the perfect design and got sick of her even when writing her in the game in the first place. Two, her fandom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> status. While he was okay with the Demons getting a lot of attention in general, he hated that Legion by far out-popularized all of them and especially because it was for what he thought was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestKnownForTheFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestKnownForTheFanservice">for the wrong reasons.</a> Jimmy has outright stated that if he were to start killing major named characters &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">for real, at that</a> &mdash; Legion <em>would</em> be the <em>first</em> on the chopping block. And he even reminded players that it's said in-game that if one body of a Hive Mind-Type Demon dies, the rest of them die shortly after. The biggest reason why he didn't is because he's sure the popularity of his game would tank without her there.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFourCreatorReactions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFourCreatorReactions">Rule 34 &#150; Creator Reactions</a>:
<ul><li> Jimmy's general stance is this: He's absolutely not surprised that it exists, especially because he's had it happen to his prior webcomics. (He <em>was</em> surprised to see porn drawn of his webcomics, but for two reasons: One, he assumed that they would be too obscure for any remotely talented artist to want to make lewds of even as a joke, and two, his comics were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrossoutShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrossoutShow">Grossout Show</a>s. The <em>Sanity</em>verse is much more well-known and has a lot of genuine fanservice and the like in it.) He <em>typically</em> doesn't judge. He <em>does,</em> however, strongly dislike doing anything lewd or even <em>joking about</em> anything lewd with the underaged characters of the game, and to the point of being "suspicious" about anyone who ages them up.
</li><li> The rest of the team on the other hand is a bit more negative with this.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>: Jimmy did not expect his webcomic to blow up the way it did.

<p></p><h2> <em>A Brother and His Sisters</em> Webcomic</h2>
<p></p><h2> <em>Siblings of Sanity</em>, base game</h2>
<p></p><ul><li>
</li><li> The buildup to the Fallen's fight is surprisingly ominous. Most of Chapter 2 has been themed around the ruins of a section of the city, leading to a gigantic church area where the music suddenly stops. You're climbing through a dusty, abandoned building that's falling apart
</li><li> Chapter 3. The first two chapters had different general settings, but both of them could still be described as "within the city." Want a change of pace? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: It starts off as what looks like an innocent stroll through a small meadow, before the Siblings abruptly fall down a pit made by the Trickster and wind up in an abandoned factory with killer robots, and then that leads out to a <em>flesh cavern</em> with horrible monsters that would make the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Crimson</a> enemies shit themselves. The further you go in to the cavern the yellower it becomes, as if it's rotting. Also, when you first enter the factory, it's the one and only moment in the game where you are truly trapped without any way to immediately backtrack to the main world, since you need to clear a few puzzles before you can make the ladder to get back up.
</li><li> Before you find out about Legion, the atmosphere of Chapter 5 is downright terrifying. You enter a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil">swamp</a> near the edge of the city and suddenly fog reduces your visibility to almost nothing, the game introduces both poison water that damages you and muddy water that slows you down (regular water <em>was</em> in before but it was mostly a decoration that never affected your speed, even if it was knee-deep), both of which help make you feel extra vulnerable. You encounter odd-looking naked women who keep giving you contradictory evidence/claims and point you in opposite directions, and the sign in the middle is illegible gibberish for a reason that's never explained. If you don't put together the clues and figure out that the "helpless and trapped" naked women <em>are</em> the chapter's boss, then said boss feels like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a> incarnate, as all four previous chapter villains introduced themselves fairly early in their arc if not sooner and told you everything you needed to know about them. If you <em>do</em> figure it out, then they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a> incarnate, you the player <em>know</em> that these are somehow the villain in disguise but the characters do not and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a>. The icing on the cake is right before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, where you go to a river and suddenly a <em>HUGE</em> figure (several of Legion's bodies playing shadow puppet tricks to make themselves look horrible), only visible as a shadow in the fog, rises up in the background, blocks off your escape, and starts rushing towards you. While your mobility is limited by the mud. Almost any player's instinct is to get the hell away from it, and the game makes it easy enough to do so (but not so easy as to take away the tenseness of the scene), but if you <em>approach</em> the monster or just stand there it suddenly vanishes. Then you enter a seemingly abandoned house with what looks like <strong>blood splatters</strong> on the floor and walls (really red paint) and the music screaches to a halt. Eventually you come across a diary, you are prompted to read it, but warned that something may happen if you do. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> players especially already have a bad feeling about that. Once you do and get a few pages in, the word "WAIT!" appears in giant, rainbow-colored text... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bathos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bathos">and then the lights click on, an embarrassed Legion casually walks in to the room with her hand out and the tense mood goes away.</a>
<ul><li> Say what you will about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Heyyin,</a> but if you try to get her advice while in the swamp, she sounds more scared and worried the further in it you go. It's one of the few times where she drops her usual smug jerk persona, and reminds you that she's at the end of the day a scared little girl who had just found herself in the unfamiliar world of being an Informant, and she wants nothing more than to leave. Note that she has a farily blase reaction to the abandoned factory or the flesh cavern.
</li><li> Following after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em>, every area has its own map, with fairly standard lines indicating "this screen links to here with this, this screen links to here with this," and so on. Prior to reading Legion's diary, the map itself of the swamp looks less like a game interface map and more like some poor, lost schmuck trying desperately to map out an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a>. The boxes representing the "screens" look like they're sketched on ruined paper with pen, there's all sorts of question marks lining the edges of certain screens, and most alarmingly, the map doesn't even tell you which screen you're in, which is especially bad because the swamp is the largest single area in the entire game, so it's <em>very</em> easy to get lost.
</li><li> Chapters 3 and 4 had some kind of simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">Broken Bridge</a> keeping you out of them, and since Chapter 1 was a linear romp through the Outskirts before you went to the proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubWorld">Hub World</a> that linked the other chapters (except 6), technically the only thing blocking Chapter 2 was that you had to go rather linearly through Chapter 1 until you reached the main city. Respectively, Chapter 3 was blocked by a giant boulder that you blow up by taking a bomb from the Fallen, and Chapter 4 was blocked off by a moving platform over a huge pit being depowered. Chapter 5? It's the only location with guards stationed in front of that explicitly <em>forbid</em> you from entering until you have the other four Shards. They don't even think that the Sanitys, who are celebrities well-known for their monster-hunting, have a chance to survive in the swamp. And if you fall in battle, you end up proving them right. <em>Siblings of Sanity: Legion</em> implies that the guards were stationed there because of
</li></ul></li><li> The second DLC also came with a free update to the vanilla game that, among other things, adds a day and night cycle. Visually, Chapters 3 and 4 are unaffected much, since most of them are set underground. Chapter 1 isn't really anything pants-shitting either, it's just a wide, open countryside. The dark aura around Chapter 6's location makes it pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysNight">Always Night</a> &mdash; it <em>is</em> a bit darker going there at the actual night, but it's hard to tell the difference unless you have a side-by-side comparison over twelve in-game hours. Chapters 2 and 5 on the other hand? Good <em>lord.</em> The run-down part of the city goes from being "maybe unsettling, but it has this cool feeling to it" to "Good lord I'm gonna get jumped in the streets at any moment."
</li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>Siblings of Sanity</em>, "Harder Demons" DLC</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> <em>All</em> of the superbosses (except maybe the Quartet, but ironically they're the most vicious of the bunch) look far worse and more threatening than their main game counterparts, and it's not helped that you fight all five of them in what feels like darker and more twisted versions of the setting of most of the chapter. Like their vanilla counterparts they turn out to be quirky and have their
</li><li> Bonus 1 is the only Harder Demons chapter set aboveground, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it when you wander in. Right out in the middle of the plains you see a forest that <em>clearly</em> doesn't look natural, and once Behemoth is defeated he grants you access to it and says that it was grown by his pissed off cousins just before the Sanitys arrived to town. The leaves blanket almost all sunlight (<em>almost,</em> as it's even <em>darker</em> when going there at night),
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li> Bonus 4 is set in a chamber deeper within the same crypt as Chapter 4. Unlike Chapter 4, Bonus 4's location is far more alive, with various cultist NPCs asking the team bizarre questions like "How do you live with the knowledge of death?" and "," you go up and down various floors that become more and more ominous and powerful, then you end up going through a portal at the end where you fight the only confirmed otherworldly boss in the entire game, the Creeper. Who looks like a much, <em>much</em> worse version of Lenore. And is significantly less friendly.
<ul><li> The entrance to Creeper's arena is a giant room with a circle-drawing in the middle, and a <em>gigantic</em> door with what looks like blood around the edges. Entering the room starts the cutscene that automatically leads to the boss, so you can only interact with the door after defeating Creeper. When you do, however, the general concensus of the party is that since they're already done with the extradimensional horror &mdash; or, okay, extradimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> &mdash; they have no need to open that door, and they really don't want to know what's behind it. Melanie is the only one who ignoes that and <em>tries</em> to open it, but when she tries she notes that she gets a very sudden compulsion telling her to keep it shut. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">This is never explained.</a>
</li><li> The creepiest thing about the crypt is that it's the only area in the game that definitely has more to it, and it's easily accessable in theory, but the party flat-out <em>will not let you go there.</em> In addition to the massive door, there's an elevator system used to go in-between the different "floors" of the Crypt, with the topmost one being Chapter 4. But the Sanitys themselves refuse to go too far down. A map implies that there are <strong>one hundred</strong> floors to this labyrinth, and each one gets worse and creepier than the last. The lowest floor you're allowed to access? <em>Five.</em>
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>Siblings of Sanity</em>, "Pirates but not Really" DLC</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> The "lake" is more like a natural harbor that leads out in to the ocean. Anyone who has played a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em> game and familiar with <em>this</em> game's humor (everyone playing this would fall under the latter at least, since beating Chapter 1 is required to access this) would probably think that sailing all the way out there might be a bad idea. They're sort of right; you get attacked by the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BorderPatrol">Border Patrol</a> <em>long</em> before you go near the river that leads out to the ocean. In this case it's a <em>huge</em> (bigger than No Beard's ship) thing that can best be described as a shark with a spider's face and legs. Yeah, not a pleasant way to go.
<ul><li> What's worse is that you can <em>see</em> the spider-shark monster under the water if you look carefully enough. The lakebed is fully modelled and it runs down <em>deep,</em> and while at no point do the Sanitys fall off their raft and have to swim through the lake, it's clear that
</li></ul></li><li> Central Island. It's an exceptionally tiny island with nothing but a strange statue on it of a big-eyed figure that looks nothing like anything else in the game, which only stares at you. And the music stops if you sail anywhere near it. Even with all three DLC packs on, you cannot do anything with it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">It's completely unexplained and just there.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wait around a bit, and the eyes start <em>following you.</em></span>
</li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>Siblings of Sanity</em>, "Legion's Legacy" DLC</h2>
<p></p><h2> Other</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> The reason why the Moon looks like its bottom part is blown off is because <em>it was.</em> Just a few decades in the past, a powerful wizard blew up the South Pole of the Moon for the hell of it. Power like that isn't <em>commonplace</em> in the <em>Siblings of Sanity</em> world, but it still happens "more often than you think."
</li><li> The official Twitter posted a map of the entire world. Similar to Earth, even if this ain't Earth, there's a major "western section" and a major "eastern section." For some reason, the east continents are <em>entirely</em> iced over and are said to be uninhabitable wastelands to humans, but thriving grounds for monsters. That would be an unsettling thought in of itself &mdash; <em>half</em> the surface of the world (and god knows <em>what</em> lurks in the ocean depths), but it's heavily implied that the reason for this is <em>not</em> natural. Especially since the ice looks purple-tinted.
</li><li> The world in general isn't a place most people would want to live in. Humanity is not only not the dominant species, but even the more populous sapient races (fairies and demons) are constantly getting attacked and torn apart by monsters, the only civilizations who can somewhat "reliably" survive them are fortified

While they're a weird bunch, they <em>are</em> pillars of sanity compared to the completely nuts town they spend most of the game in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMeanAndInBetween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMeanAndInBetween">Nice Mean And In Between</a>: Marilyn is the Mean, a rude and arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> that always bites off more than she can chew, and is always the first of the trio to give snippy comments towards other people and even the bosses of the game. Melanie is the Nice, the much more reasonable of the sisters who helps others out of genuine kindness and may even turn down rewards offered to her if she feels that they're too excessive. Marty is the In-Between, he's stoic for the most part, and while he turns out to be somewhat dorky and goofy as the game goes on, "nice" never <em>quite</em>

A seemingly normal girl who, along with her parents, were attacked by giant hellhound beasts before the Sanity Siblings rode in to save them.

Pretty much any time she's alone with any Sanity sibling, her real personality shines out. Plus, the player can find her diary by her house after every chapter, and putting it bluntly, her comments on <em>everybody</em> are not nice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>: In summary, she was designed the way she looks to try to force players to accept the game having a naked girl in it and making a point that she's not sexualized, unlike the nude adult characters like Marilyn, Marty, Trickster, and Legion; and <em>just like</em> various side characters used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a>, laughs, or both like the Gutter Bather or the Free Spirit. Specifically, this came about because someone criticized the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> of <em>A Brother and His Sisters</em>, Gate, for saying that her leaf skirt was too short and that he should redesign his fairies without them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">He did.</a>

She loves messing with all three Sanitys, especially Marilyn.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Medium Awareness</a>: She's the only character in the whole game that directly addresses the player and points things out to them directly, in and out of the "tutorial segments." It's implied that this is something specific to her species.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardCharacterDesign">Nonstandard Character Design</a>: She's the only <em>main</em> character with large, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes">Black Bead Eyes</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePop">(except for when she's surprised)</a>, even when she was in her "human form" at the beginning of the game.

Even more suspicious is that Gate is the only character from the original webcomic who flat-out <em>vanishes</em> (at first, Jimmy retconned in a quick blurb saying that she decided to stay ). Both of them even have names that are Navi references. (Navi + Gate = navigate, and Heyyin is a corruption of Navi's infamous "Hey! Listen!")

There is an achievement for Enraging each boss on the first turn and then beating them like that.
<ul><li> Despite being the first boss, Behemoth has the easiest way to piss him off; <em>any</em> water attacks will do it, by short-fusing his bombs. He and Legion are also the only two who have a Berserk Button not tied to gameplay; in his case, don't you <em>dare</em> make fun of his huge ass.

All six of them also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorContrast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorContrast">Color Contrast</a> to differing degrees with the area you fight them in:
<ul><li> Behemoth: Orange. His fur is brown, a dark orange, and the only things he "wears" are bright orange bands around his legs/paws and horns. He's fought near a giant, crystal blue lake. Symbolically, orange can be seen as representing anger or rage, and he's the most hot-tempered of the six.
</li><li> Fallen: Blue. She obviously wears blue robes, and her hair is blue. She's fought in the ruins of a church, which had become a faded brown from disuse. Symbolically, blue can be seen as a color of calmness or "purity," she appears to be calm and she fights in a holy-themed area,

He's fought inside a particularlly yellow-washed (for some reason better not thought about) chamber of a flesh cavern, and even before that the factory you go to to reach that dungeon is tinted yellow from rust. Symbolically, purple can be seen to represent love or lust, and he's the most sexual of the demons seen thusfar, being openly flirty with the Sanitys (or at least Melanie).
</li><li> Leviathan: Green. As a part-plant... dragon-looking thing, she's mostly green all over, and the walls of her pit are lined with green vines everywhere. The pit itself and <em>especially</em> her tomb are a dark, bloody red. Green is used to represent tranquility or nature, and she's in touch with both of them, being the calmest and nicest of the gang and having interests like hiking and camping.
</li><li> Legion: Red, the only one that's not immediately obvious. While Legion herself has a body for every color in the rainbow, her designated "main" body is half reddish-pink, and half cyanish-blue, and you most often see red paint around her home (which resembles blood). Fittingly for her being an artist, her Contrast involves the RGB/CMYK color model moreso than it does the RYB model for everybody else, as half of her "main" body is the opposite to red according to <em>that</em> model, and her region, a plant-filled swamp, is tealish, but has bits of green here and there. Red can be used to symbolize love, which she seeks more than the other five, or violence, which she's trying to go out of her way to <em>avoid.</em>
</li><li> Dealer: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Yellow/gold/white.</a> He's clad in a fancy gold suit at all times and has blond hair. The forest that held the Gem of Life <em>was</em> a peaceful green, but after he stole the Gem and shattered it in to five, it became a sickly, dark purple and black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">mordor</a>. Symbolically yellow can be used to represent optimism, which fuels his entire plan. Yellow also symbolizes fear and caution; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when his daughter was killed, he blamed himself for being too frozen in fear and ignoring his own instincts as a parent to save her</span>.

Hell, even in terms of how sexualized they are, it's balanced. There's a clothed/modest male member, a nude/sexy male member, and an inhuman-looking male member. A clothed/modest female member, a nude/sexy female member, and an inhuman-looking female member. All three DLC pack bosses follow similarly, except that in the first DLC, all the bosses fall under "inhuman-looking" to various degrees, while all bosses in the following two fall under "nude (or near-nude)/sexy," but in either case there are the same number of men as there are women<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11jfbp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11jfbp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11jfbp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, with <em>groups</em> it's a different story. Behemoth's counterpart for DLC 1 is a team of <em>four</em> women and Legion's is a team of 101 skeletons that, unlike her, are independant and not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a></span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a>: They're all at least 40, given that the prequel webcomic takes place about 15 years in the past and Legion is explicitely in her mid-twenties, and in the game proper an offhand comment from Fallen to Leviathan has her say they're all (referring to <em>all</em> the demons) about the same age except Dealer, who is later revealed to be 50. They look more like young adults instead (except Behemoth, who looks more like some kind of big dog creature with horns, and Leviathan, who looks more like a giant reptillian plant monster). Justified in that all of them are some kind of demon being, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">which stops aging in their twenties.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: All of them do the typical old RPG thing of "the boss is standing in the way of the path to go on," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">except they leave enough space so that it's possible to walk right around them.</a> If you do this and try to just walk to the Shard they guard, they get annoyed, and either trigger the battle anyway (Behemoth, Fallen) or the game automatically makes the Siblings walk back (Trickster, Leviathan, Legion), depending on the specific boss's personality. Dealer is the one exception to the rule because he's not guardian anything, the Siblings just need to go up to him and kick his ass.

<p>A giant beast that loves making bombs or just shooting explosive energy out of his hands/paws. He's encountered in the Countryside Outskirts, and at first he seems like a random monster attacking people before he reveals that he's part of a group after his defeat. Unlike the other Demons, he doesn't have a "base" set up per-say, because he doesn't think he needs one.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss">Warmup Boss</a>: The first boss of the game and he's technically fought in the tutorial.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>: Behemoth and Fallen were simple enough, they had very telegraphed attacks that told you which sibling they would target, and they both pretty much tell you their weakness. The biggest obstacle between the two of them was Fallen having exactly one turn devoted to giving a major sound-related debuff to the party at once, but this can easily be mitigated and most of those debuffs can be cured. Then comes the Trickster, the first boss that pretty much <em>needs</em> strategy unless you're horribly overleveled, unless you only want to deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to him. While his attacks aren't too nasty when it comes to dodging them, they hurt like hell, making it an early indicator that you can't really "tank" your way through this game, and that learning how to dodge and counter attacks is required.

<p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> of a hundred bodies that lives out (not "set up her base," her "base" is actually her <em>home</em> this time) in the swamp on the outskirts of [town name], also an artist with a fondness for tabletop games.
</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: She's openly friendly with the group even after revealing her true nature to them, and admits that her mind game with her bodies tricking them and luring them to different points of the swamp was just to try to get them away from her so that she wouldn't have to fight them directly. Even when "Enraged," she just comes off as mildly frustrated compared to the <em>far</em> angrier other bosses. The meanest she ever acts to the Siblings is right after her battle, where she's fallen on her face, dazed and surrounded by her other bodies. If you talk to her, she'll bluntly tell you "You have the Gem now so just go away please."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: She gave every single one of her bodies a name<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note137m4l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note137m4l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note137m4l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Amora" is the name of her in general, <em>not</em> her "main" body, that one's </span> but the only way to see them <em>all</em> in-game is through getting her Scan.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbieDollAnatomy">Barbie Doll Anatomy</a>: Like Trickster she's naked at all times (all her bodies are), but lacks anything <em>too</em> raunchy. Downplayed in that her breasts have visible "bumps" where nipples should be and her crotch has a visible swell indicating pubic fat (yes, again, for all bodies), which are things typically not seen in stories where the trope is at play. If <em>she's</em> given the Oiled debuff, <em>her</em> oil covers her in a way that looks like minimal censorship, and oddly enough she looks even <em>more</em> suggestive when covered that way. She and Trickster both seem to canonically have the "bits," as the spinoff webcomic gives both of them nipples, and opts to continuously use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryCensor">Scenery Censor</a> to hide them downstairs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a>: She was intended to just be one of the bosses in the game, if one of the exceptionally fanservice-y ones, and her story would mostly be done after beating her chapter. She ended up getting more "attention" than the developers predicted, and as a result she got herself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a> prequel comic spinoff detailing her romantic exploits with a boyfriend she mentioned in Chapter 5, and there's going to be an entire <em>third</em> DLC themed around her. (Originally, just two DLC packs were planned, Harder Demons and Pirates But Not Really, )
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatScare">Cat Scare</a>: While going through a river in her swamp, a <em>massive</em> figure obscurred by the fog will suddenly rise up and chase the party down. The intent was that this was easy enough for most players to get out of the way and assume that something would have happened had they been caught. Actually get caught, and the figure shakes, appears to break off in to several pieces, and then run away.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DCupDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DCupDistress">D-Cup Distress</a>: She hates being really busty, back problems being her biggest issue. Especially seeing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">situation.</a> On the other hand, she <em>likes</em> having (a) large ass(es).
<div class="indent"><strong>Legion:</strong> You've already heard about this, right?! Back problems caused by the puppies&mdash; no, these aren't puppies, these are <em>wolves.</em> <em>Hellhounds!</em> Well, picture that but multiplied by a hundred! If I'm not careful I have to deal with a <em>hundred</em> backaches at once!
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Didn't Think This Through</a>: Not nearly as bad as Leviathan or Behemoth, but she has her share of these:
<ul><li> When chasing the party through the swamp river, she failed to think of what she'd actually do if she <em>caught</em> them. The "large monster" was really just all of her bodies awkwardly piled together, if the Sanitys actually <em>saw</em> her they'd put two and two together and realize they were being tricked by the "helpless naked 'fairy' women" found in the swamp and that was what she was trying to avoid. If she "catches you" during the river chase sequence, you can see her visibly panic as she didn't expect it to happen, and then quickly take off and leave.
</li><li> The river chase also ends up making the Sanitys run <em>closer</em> to her home, which was exactly what she <em>didn't</em> want to happen.
<div class="indent"><strong>Melanie:</strong> Hey, uh. We know where you live now! <br><strong>Legion:</strong> My fault.
</div></li><li> Most of her plan hinges on the Sanitys knowing nothing about her. She failed to realize that she lives near the city and several locals have seen her and know about her. It's just through sheer, dumb <em>luck</em> that absolutely nobody told the Sanitys what Legion looks like prior to Chapter 5. And then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">for some reason,</a> once the chapter is over the townspeople won't shut up about her.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>: The holder of the final Shard, she's the last of the demons fought before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> himself and is the most threatening.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>: Plenty to the reveal that not only is she a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, but she's the true identity of all the colorful nude women seen throughout the swamp area:
<ul><li> Immediately after beaten the Behemoth, the party gets a vision of the King surrounded by silhouettes of all six demons. The Dealer looms on in the background, Behemoth is to the left, and in a circle from there they are in the order you fight them. Right next to the dealer appears to be three humanoid figures huddled up together, with a large indiscernable mass behind them.
</li><li> In an optional, easily missable conversation in Chapter 2, Fallen will explicitely refer to one of the later members of the group as "Legion," the only time prior to late-Chapter 5 she's referred to by name. The player knows right off the bat that there are six of them total, and with four of them taken care of by Chapter 5 and one of the only two left being known as the Dealer, that leaves Chapter 5 as "Legion's" chapter, so the players that managed to see that conversation should be expecting a character themed around a group in some way.
</li><li>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">Gaslighting</a>: Her bodies deliberately give the Sanitys contradictory evidence and mislead them at every turn in order to try to get them to go back and leave. Notably, she apologizes for doing that (but <em>not</em> actually <em>fighting</em> the trio, she says outright that she doesn't feel bad about that) if you talk to her after starting Chapter 6 and admits that's a dirty trick used by assholes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>: A variation where all of her bodies were originally and rightfully "hers," and were all born together. (Her mother was a giantess, don't ask.) She has a designated "main" body &mdash; the one that's half-reddish pink, half greenish blue &mdash; except since she controls all of them "equally" it's more of just what body she uses as her main avatar to talk to others. Uniquely, the reveal that she's a hive mind is <em>not</em> played for horror, and in fact it's when her chapter becomes more lighthearted.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicName">Ironic Name</a>:
<ul><li> The nickname "Legion" would bring to mind a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive">Mind Hive</a>, when she's the opposite of that.
</li><li> Her actual name is derived from "love," but she's had pretty bad luck romance-wise. Both back in school, and later in a prequel comic where she meets a messanger who eventually breaks up with her after disliking her siding with Luis. Granted, it's suggested she will get back with the latter after the events of <em>Siblings of Sanity</em> proper, but still.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a>:
<ul><li>
</li><li> The player can also <em>invoke</em> this. When she's standing in the overworld and available to talk to, normally talking to her face-to-face will give a regular message. Go around and try "talking" to her rear, and she'll give a comment. Usually in amusement, but do this right after her boss fight (where her main body is landed with her ass in the air) and she'll be annoyed.
<div class="indent"><strong>Legion:</strong> Haha, gazing upon my MASSIVE DUMP TRUCK, are you?! I'm gonna give a whole new meaning to the term "Swamp Ass," just watch! <br><strong>Legion, after her boss fight:</strong> Yes, yes, my butt is big. Please leave. You're in the Dealer's hands now.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>: Pretty much the only female character in the game who can best Marilyn at this. She's a completely nude <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girl</a> with a curvy, buxom figure &mdash; or, <em>a hundred</em> curvy, buxom figure. The game and its supplimentary material waste no time going over how she can basically be a "one-woman orgy,"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotDistractedByTheSexy">Not Distracted by the Sexy</a>: Astonishingly, <em>nobody</em> prior to Chapter 6 comments on her appearance aside from one minor nameless NPC, and the ones that do during Chapter 6 are typically bit characters. Marty is head-over-heels for Fallen for some reason but doesn't really care that a far nicer, far nakeder character would become his target much later. This is especially weird in contrast to Trickster, who has various characters pointing out the fact that he's naked at any time and find him seductive. If it wasn't for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a>s in her proper introduction, one could even believe that she wasn't even designed to be a fanservice character at all and it was unintended.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a>: Downplayed, her <em>bodies</em> have the same exact bodytype, but her hair is styled to be unique. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>d by saying that the bodies of Hive Minds all share nutrients with one-another and roughly develop and grow in the same way, meanwhile it's much easier for Legion to just take her hair(s) and stylize it in one fashion or another.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F-Strike</a>: It's censored, but she drops the only swear in the game.

The place is a complete acid-trip to so much as look at &mdash; it looks like it's both inside the stomach of some giant red fleshy monster <em>and</em> there's a visible Alien Sky with clouds, stars, and a moon in some parts, giving it the image of a place where you're not sure if it could be considered "inside" or "outside." Everything twists and turns around, and while most of it looks organic, other parts look to be made out of Hard Light. Except for the Garden of Pete, a relatively normal looking garden admist a world of chaos. That's just the looks, concept-wise it's weirder: it's not a physical "location" normally, it's some kind of "side space" that runs <em>parallel</em> with the "normal" reality, it's just that neither can percieve one-another normally without a great source of magic, and the Big Bad is distorting space so that the Spirits and the Four Humans end up there. It's described as "linear" and space and time do not work like normal, and the clearest example of this is that if you keep walking in any given direction, space will appear (to the minds of "Extants") to warp around so that you eventually end up being faced with an inhabitant called the Wall, a horriffic-looking if friendly mass of flesh that shows a poor understanding of terms of relative location and freaks out when Soap curiously asks what's "behind" him. Also, everybody treats the Garden of Pete like it's some kind of horrible Genius Loci, and it's unclear if it really is or if that's just because to them seeing something "normal" looks weird. Surprisingly, most of the inhabitants are friendly, with the exception of the Royal (the <em>most</em> human-looking). Also, You Cannot Grasp the True Form is <em>not</em> in effect; this is what Nonexistence "actually looks like," and how it actually is. We can't normally see it not because our brains won't let us, but because "seeing" and "spacetime" work <em>completely differently,</em> you need to fuck with space and time to reach it in the first place.</span>

You are on a time limit, but it's <em>very</em> generous &mdash; ten minutes, they can easily be beaten in under three. The latter is the only battle/date in the entire game where you can heal, and the Cloaked only has three main attacks, one of which is <em>short-ranged</em> in a schmup game where you could likely attack across the screen by that point, and their health is pitiful. The former boss fight at least has the excuse that, like Photoshop Flowey, it came in with several Anti-Frustration Features to combat the "shift" of the fight. But the latter is closer mechanic-wise to a typical Date and has no such excuse.

Their true nature is an entity from an Eldritch Location that's normally friendly in spite of its distorted appearance, and they came to view their homeworld as disgusting and boring, wanting to conquer Earth instead. After creating a human avatar and spending over a century trying to build up a good reputation, the Royal decided once all pieces were in place to start a plan that involves locating a Charge, an exceptionally powerful human who can freely use their own magic and gain strength by taking the magic from other humans, and sending them on a horribly traumatizing life to get their powers to awaken faster. In the meantime, they got [One] exiled out to the Spirit Society as a teenager. With Sandy being the Charge they were looking for, the Royal kills their birth parents in an attack that burnt down their entire home town, sends hunters to kill their adopted wolf-parents and force them in a circus, and they lead two more humans in to the Spirit Society so that they can use Sandy &mdash; who is still only ten years old at the time &mdash; as a battery to drain all the captives. When a portal to her home, Nonexistence, was finally opened, they made a vow to bring their weapons in and crush Earth, and end up killing two of the four humans they trapped, and nearly wipe a third, Soap, from existence outright. When challenged, the Royal beats up any of the love interests Soap had dated, and threatens to erase them from existence as well, painfully altering and distorting all of them as they make the threat. Soap is presented the option to kill them or try to help them after the fight; picking the latter results in the Royal laughing at Soap for ever trusting them and "corrupting" the ending photo, implying that they're going to strike either in-world or on your computer. While Soap and their harem survives the fight, [One and Two] do not even in the best ending, and a traumatized Sandy teleports/time travels to parts unknown. Sadistic and selfish, the Royal used humans, nymphs, and even their own world's inhabitants as pawns in a game of world domination, killed millions, and had no problem harming children along the way. While the Cloaked is fought "after" them, the Cloaked is more of a Well-Intentioned Extremist and has too many noble traits to count, in spite of being a step higher on the villain heiarchy.</span>

<ul><li> The general reaction was that while the endgame itself <em>was</em> shocking, a lot of the "surrounding" portions of it... well, opinions on that are a lot more mixed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Namely, if you save while in Nonexistence, then close and open the game, it tries to pull a "creepypasta" where the game looks normal until you go to the save in Nonexistence, which appears glitchy. Interacting with it suddenly distorts the music, has the 16-bit sprites of the Spirits woo'd distort and appear to lose their heads, and the background turns in to that of Nonexistence/the same background that's serves as that to the Royal fight. The icing on the cake was the original, pre-1.1 patch text, which read "Enter the nightmare?" which some fans thought was <em>way</em> too on the nose. 1.1 changed the text to a more subtle "Are you sure you want to access Save [number]?" (the normal text is just "Access save [number]?"), but everything else stayed. Also, in the playable epilogue, walking up to a seemingly random <em>car</em> gives you the option to "Go back in time before the nightmare," meant to prevent 100% completion from being permanently missable since you can't woo any new Spirits in the epilogue (just re-date old ones and do the minigames), which comes off as sounding really awkward. Especially since if you <em>do</em> go back in time, then go to where and when you <em>would</em> trigger the endgame, the game just tells you if you want to skip "the nightmare" and go back to the epilogue. (This one was also changed in a patch, saying instead to skip/time travel before Act 6, but the use of time travel comes out of nowhere.) Basically the insistence on calling the horror part of the game "The Nightmare" can be groan-worthy to some.</span>

<ul><li> Right off the bat, the premise of a human wandering to a faelike world and trying to seduce multiple partners at once rose eyebrows. There's a small yet vocal subset of the game's critiquers who believe that the game is a cheap harem fantasy where dozens of women are treated as objects and gathered together to be trophies for the player, with no concern for their own being, and that the option to select the sex of your player character and the Spirits are seen as a clumsy way to "downplay" this with a half-assed "but you can do the exact same thing to men too." The creator and main developer is an openly gay woman. The view died down significantly once the game was released and it was made pretty clear that it's <em>not</em> exactly "Talk Your Way in to the Metaphorical Pants of Some Fairies Simulator Without Caring About Them and Then Cheat on Them 20[insert second half of a year number here]"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14egq1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14egq1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14egq1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Soap never cheats on anybody; it's an open polyamourous relationship, they always tell the other Spirits about their prior partners on introduction, and said partners tend to interact with one-another. Building relationships is also not based on making correct choices but instead through linear progression and playing through a minigame, so it isn't a matter of Soap just finding the right thing to say to manipulate anyone. Lastly, the game "presents" options to do something bad but refuses to let you do them <em>because</em> of Soap themselves (your actions are only "things Soap could potentially do"), and trying them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a> that gets you called out rather mercilessly.

The <em>menu itself</em> is normal... until you go to a save file set in Nonexistence. The box itself appears to be glitchy and distorted and in place of most stats is garbled nonsense. In the place of the playtime is tiny text reading "thereisnotimehere" looped over and over. Actually <em>select</em> the save file and suddenly the game appears to freak out, the music "freezing" in place and turning in to a whine repeating whatever note it was on during the selection, the background turning to a garbled mess that's half the usual sky and half the "sky" of Nonexistence, and <em>the copyright information</em> freaking out and turning in to quickly-shifting random characters. And normally, the save file has small 16-bit RPG sprites of all the nymphs you've charmed. They're still here, except their sprites are glitched so that their heads are missing &mdash; as though the Prince/Princess <em>decapitated</em> all of them. The only clear text is "Are you sure you want to access File (number)?" a subtle change from the "Access File (number)?" that plays normally, that all adds up to make you <em>really</em> not want to load that save. If you back out, the menu suddenly goes back to normal. It's like something out of a particularly unsubtle creepypasta.

You're wandering around, enter this cave in the overworld, and after a suspiciously long fade to black, the game fades in to show a very realistic-looking dragon-like monster staring right at you. With what looks like giant fireballs for eyes. And the Dragon talks. Not talks as in the usual "text box with words in it," he actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyVoiced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyVoiced">TALKS.</a></em>

Stepping through reveals a massive wasteland that appears to be made <em>entirely</em> of bones, and with a pitch-black sky. Then a skeleton slowly closes in on you. If it were not for how that same skeleton, moments later, begins joking
<ul><li> What's worse about the "bone wasteland" is that this is all-but said outright to be what the exterior of the Gathering looks like. Think, it's explicitely said to be a place "in the middle of the four worlds," but once you are teleported there, you spend most of it indoors, and all the "windows" are opaque.

<p>You start the game off being told if you want to play as a man or a woman, and if you want to date men or women. Then you're just immediately dumped off to it. You wake up naked in a forest &mdash; and while I'm trying to do this review/analysis in the same rough order a playthrough would go, not spoiling much ahead, I will tell you right now that you are never given any explanation why you're naked at the start. None of the other humans who end up on the Lost Path lose their clothes when they cross the Miasma and your character in a flashback is seen clearly wearing clothes... I don't know. Anyway, you are naked and have what might be the <em>smallest</em> censors I've ever seen in a game, by default it's just a tiny black circle over your groin and if you pick Fem Soap two more over the chest. You can adjust the settings to change it to pixellation, a blur effect, steam, light motes, "dark motes," heart symbols, star symbols, or even JPEGs of the developer's face, but all of them are really small and give away that your character doesn't have anything to hide downstairs and <em>does</em> have something to hide upstairs if a woman, if barely.
</p><p>What I find very interesting is that this game shows so much with this sequence right away. When the camera is automatically moving by itself, it's always faced so that you <em>only</em> see this beautiful forest behind you that Soap starts out facing once they wake up. However, if you're the exploratory type and turn it around, you will immediately see something jarring. This massive, giant field of jagged black... stuff. It looks like a huge wall of black chalk with dark colored scribbles in the middle. You find out soon that this is called the Miasma and it is possible to go through most of the prologue without ever seeing it, despite being this giant wall that's right behind you at the beginning. It's pretty surreal. Anyway, this is one of those games that's really nit-picky about what you do and won't let you live this down, in other words it's one where your choices matter a great deal.

</p><p>Here's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Blazblue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Blazblue">Izanami's</a> old nightmare fuel entry, please don't delete it:
</p><ul><li> <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant">Izanami</a>.</strong></em>
<ul><li> She's a malevolent goddess of death who wants to turn the world into a desolate wasteland, and the true antagonist of the series. Despite seeming like a straight-laced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain">Generic Doomsday Villain</a>, her actions are the reason why current world of <em>BlazBlue</em> is so messed up. She conspired with Terumi and Relius to destroy the Amaterasu Unit, which required a vessel with enough power to contain her. That vessel just so happened to be Saya, Ragna &amp; Jin's younger sister, whom Terumi had kidnapped. As Terumi was the founder of the NOL and Sector Seven, he pulled some strings in order to allow Izanami to become the Imperator, supplanting the true royal lineage - the Amanohokosaka family. She orchestrated the Ikaruga Civil War not only in a bid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">wipe out the royal family</a> but also to satisfy her twisted whims. Under her rule, the NOL became an iron-fisted dictatorship that used subjugation, memory-alteration, and black ops to create more death and tragedy. Once she starts getting involved in <em>Chronophantasma</em>, shit hits the fan. She coldly betrays Terumi and Relius without a second thought, leaving them for dead when their plans are foiled. Izanami is so powerful that not only does she survive Hakumen's Time Killer (his ultimate technique which literally erases your existence), but she can summon and command Gigant: Take-Mikazuchi, a gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>, as well as the Black Beast itself. The last part she uses with sadistic glee as she forces Ragna's powers to awaken and go berserk.
</li><li> Her role in the story is terrifying enough, but once she becomes playable, her attacks involve utilizing all sorts of arcane necromancy magic, like conjuring will-o-the-wisps and summoning skulls to trap her opponent. Her Exceed Accel, however, is a perfect example of the terror she brings: <em>her face becomes a skeleton with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> while a bloodcurdling scream plays in the background.</em> Izanami then proceeds to impale the opponent with her hand while a <em>very</em> sinister laugh plays. Even worse? The Active Flow version involves chains surrounding the opponent and the screen <em>turning red</em>. Izanami is everything you fear about the concept of death made manifest, and she wants you to know it. An even more frightening prospect occurs when you realize that unlike Nine's trailer, <em>Izanami's Astral Heat isn't shown</em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXAJb5zNeqM">Her Astral<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was left out of the trailer for <em>very</em> good reasons. She grabs the opponent and opens a portal to the land of the dead, which sends dozens of spirits spiraling upward in a hurricane. As they fall, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/images/b/ba/BBCF_Izanami_Tokoyo_no_Yami.png">a picture of Izanami<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">suddenly appears</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord">an appropriate sound effect</a> showing her with <strong>completely blank, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyelightsOfUndeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyelightsOfUndeath">Glowing Eyelights of Undeath</a></strong> and a <em><strong>nightmare-inducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> on her face!</strong></em> As if that wasn't terrifying enough, she starts fading away into shadow with the background turning into skulls, then seven gigantic skulls crash down on the opponent, devouring them and sending them into the underworld as an afterimage of a skull flashes upon the screen and the same scream from her Exceed Accel blaring in the background. The way she suddenly appears is framed so that she's not looking at her opponent... <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">SHE'S LOOKING AT YOU.</a></strong></em> And to top it off, if she's not talking, she's doing a bloodlusted snarl, like a rabid dog ready to kill someone. It's now the page image.... which is basically replaced by a much more terrifying image mentioned below. Sweet dreams!
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/1E2xzx0LaXk?t=532">This is a higher quality video showing Izanami's Astral<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which shows that her glaring eyes aren't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyelightsOfUndeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyelightsOfUndeath">Glowing Eyelights of Undeath</a>... she actually has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyesAndShrunkenIrises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyesAndShrunkenIrises">very small pupils</a>, which actually make her look more terrifying, since it only further drives the point home that she's staring <em>directly</em> at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">player</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Act 2 gives us some more horrifying details about her. The body she's inhabiting (Saya) isn't even human, and Izanami herself is described as "the manifestation of 'her' Drive". We have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> on our hands.
</li><li> The preview of Act 3 is relatively tame, showing the current states of the characters, until near the end... a static image of Izanami, shown above, suddenly pops out, <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackEyesOfCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackEyesOfCrazy">sporting COMPLETELY EMPTY BLACK EYES</a></strong></em> <em><strong>and a terrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a>!!</strong></em> Talk about wanting to scare us even after her act. That very same image, without static, appears in her Act 3 ending. But of course, it starts with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a>, with the image suddenly appearing in negative colors until it becomes normal coloration, showing that <em><strong>her skin and face have become a ghastly, pale white</strong></em>.
<ul><li> The full picture is even more terrifying in full without the static. You can see the effects of the deterioration on Izanami's body. <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlayingAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlayingAlive">There's no skin on her right arm</a></strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hell, even her <em>themes</em> are pretty terrifying, even if they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyAwesome">Creepy Awesome</a>. Her main theme has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">Ominous Latin Chanting</a>, a frenetic pace as if you were being chased by a gigantic monster, and what sounds like ghostly screams at the beginning. Her theme when fighting Ragna has even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">Ominous Latin Chanting</a> and a very dark sound to it.
</li><li> In Ragna's Act II arcade ending, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit">LETS HERSELF BE STABBED</a> just to show Ragna what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a> means. The cutscene then changes to her with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">eyes wide</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile">Slasher Smile</a> all while BLEEDING ALL OVER the place. The scene itself is full of static and Izanami's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a>.
</li><li> <em>Act 3</em> introduced even more gameplay-related terror. How? <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">UNLIMITED</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">IZANAMI</a></strong>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">She's made up to be as close as possible with the ''Goddess of Death'' she really is in story</a>. If you defeat every opponent with Overdrive Finishes, you are rewarded with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a> as the ending credits are interrupted with static, and then Izanami's Drive emblem flashes on the screen while she says her Astral quote. When the match starts, you'll notice that she starts out with that barrier-consuming shield automatically out, meaning <em>you cannot damage her for as long as that shield is up</em>. She also has a much creepier looking version of Ragna's Dead Spike that propels her forward. Her projectiles now act as a boomerang that can richochet and hit you twice from the screen. She also has the teleporting counter move used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">Shadow Dio</a>. Also, her portrait gives new meaning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">Red Eyes, Take Warning</a>.

</p><p>I actually wouldn't mind using an RYB-based "rainbow group" of something so much if it was a group of twelve+ that used the tertiary colors too, I mean I just like blue-greens and using RYB but only the primary and secondary colors means there's no blue-green. You just skip straight from green to blue.
</p><p><em>Bl:oo&lt;dswap</em> is just getting the one rewritten chapter and then it's going on hiatus until the limeblood powers are revealed.

After that I don't know.
</p><p>This was on a really old thread way back when called "Oh... oh my (Western Animation Edition)" for like stuff that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> or So Bad It's What the Hell am I Looking at, this was in either <em>the</em> opening post or it was one of the first ones and I want to know what the hell this film is:
</p><ul><li> It was 3D CG.
</li><li> The main character looked kinda like a member of KISS or something? He was a... demon? Demon hunter? Demons played a role in this.
</li><li> He had a sidekick that was basically a talking skull attached to a gun.
</li><li> The beginning might have involved like a slow pan through of a graveyard or something, with weird-ass names written on the graves.
</li><li> There was a clip with the Skull Guy dropping a lot of f-bombs left and right. At least one. The movie didn't shy away from swearing. At all.
</li><li> At one point the Skull Guy talks about how he wishes he had a dick or something KISS Guy asks about the gun he was attached to. Skull Guy replies "That's me gun."
</li><li> There was at least one devil demoness or something that KISS Guy like blows up near the beginning(?), maybe two. I also remember there being a good demoness but like she was identified as a hero because of something shiny she wore(???).
</li></ul><p>I once Googled "bad CGI movies" and got nothing. That was mostly just bad CGI <em>effects</em> <strong>in</strong> movies.

To quote the article, "Several weeks ago, another distinctly canine trait showed itself. For the first time since her ordeal, she met her father, and she forgave him completely."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/article750838.ece">Danielle Crockett<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (now Dani Lierow), whose biological mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">is still insisting</a>, even after getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">probation</a>, she loved and took care of the girl despite confining her to one room for the first seven years of her life, never teaching her even the most basic English, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless">leaving her mute</a>. Dani, now 20, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/girl-in-the-window/neglect-feral-child-ten-years-later/">lives in a group home for developmentally disabled adults<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in Tennessee, where her adoptive father still visits her.
</li><li> There are several apocryphal stories about various rulers, including e. g. the medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Emperor Frederick II</a> and King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick II of Prussia</a> having children raised without motherly care, taking infants from their families and giving them to caretakers who were instructed not to cuddle or talk to them. All the babies supposedly died.
<ul><li> Possibly died. The experiment ended when the people conducting the experiment found that "the children could not live without clappings of the hands, and gestures, and gladness of countenance, and blandishments." This can be taken to mean the children died, or that the natural inclinations of children to smile, wave, hug, and otherwise be affectionate could not be repressed.
</li><li> A variant of the story - which goes back at least to Herodotus' <em>Histories</em> - has the caretakers not being allowed to talk to the babies because the monarch wanted to discover the original language of humankind that way. (Some later versions have the language turn out to be Hebrew).
</li><li> There's an experiment with baby monkeys where the monkeys were offered two "mothers": one made of wire which offered food, and one made of warmed terrycloth and offered comforting arms but no food. Every single baby monkey consistently chose the mother's arms over the food, going to the wire mother only when hungry, and scampering back to the terry mother the moment their hunger eased..
</li></ul></li><li> There are many examples of allegedly "feral" children recovered from the wild in real life. However, it is virtually impossible to definitively say how long they have actually been living in the woods. Children raised in isolation demonstrate a lack of socialization that looks like autism or Asperger's syndrome &mdash; but there is also the suggestion some of these children may have had developmental problems before being abandoned.
</li><li> The 18th century medical literature discussed several such feral children, most of whom never learned to speak, wear clothes or adapt to society and ended up in mental asylums. There are a few such "wolf children" in existence even today, ranging in age from a man in his 40s to a teenage girl. Most of them were orphaned children in Eastern European states which were part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics prior to its collapse in the 1990s. Some claim to have actually been raised by wild dogs or wolves in the woods. The good news is, the modern-day wolf children have learned language and adapted to life among people, even though the girl still refers to herself as a wolf, not a human.
</li><li> In 27 May 2009, a 5-year-old Russian girl <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5393378/Feral-child-barks-and-hisses-after-being-raised-as-a-pet.html">was found<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in a filthy apartment imitating the cats and dogs. Officials said the girl had feral characteristics and barked like a dog, lapped food off a plate and seemed to have been "raised" by the animals.
</li><li> A Russian boy was found in 2007 after apparently having lived with wolves/wild dogs. He feared humans and acted like a dog. Unfortunately, he escaped soon after being found.
</li><li> There have been cases of parents locking their autistic children away from the world because they're embarrassed by their lack of social skills. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Because you know, being locked up for the entirety of their childhood is totally good for their social skills</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Hauser">Kaspar Hauser<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is of the most famous historical examples. Showing up in a town apparently able to say nothing but "I want to be a cavalryman, as my father was" and "Horse!", he had a letter written by his supposed caretaker addressed to the commander of the local military post requesting that he be made a soldier or executed. Originally thought to have been feral, he later learned to speak and write, and claimed he was raised locked in a small room like an animal; only being let out when he was sent into town to deliver his letter. Possible subversion in that there were significant inconsistencies in his story and manner, the handwriting on his caretaker's letter matched his own, and he quickly developed a reputation as a habitual liar. Some experts of the time, and many modern researchers, considered him to be a fraud and a swindler, possibly mentally ill or developmentally disabled; and that he could not have survived the childhood conditions he described.

If its any comfort, she's doing well now.
