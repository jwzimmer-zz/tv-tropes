They can save your life. Few non-military/police heroes ever wear one, unless they are a major character and it is dramatically required that they get shot. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">we're not told about it in advance and they'll look dead for a few moments</a>.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTropes">military or combat fiction</a>, the bulletproof vest goes hand-in-hand with the Kevlar helmet. Any character who removes his helmet when a gunfight has seemingly stopped automatically takes a round in the head, unless that character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelmetsAreHardlyHeroic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelmetsAreHardlyHeroic">hero</a>, and needs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">show his face</a> for some dialogue. A common way for the military <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> to bite it.
</p><p>In fiction, a bulletproof vest is capable of stopping anything up to and including armor-piercing bullets fired by centerfire rifles. The shot might knock you down and leave you with a hole in your shirt, but you'll get up just fine. In games, vests either stop all damage or reduce it, but are often destroyed when they take enough damage (See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyArmorAsHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyArmorAsHitPoints">Body Armor as Hit Points</a>). Video game injuries are a matter of mathematical equation, whereas in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> there is a great deal of randomness involved.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In reality, the low-level vests issued to police officers are usually only rated to stop small-to-medium-caliber handgun rounds. Shotgun rounds are largely ineffective against armor, due to even the stiffer shot loads being only equivalent to 30-something caliber spherical balls &mdash; not good for piercing. Top tier soft armor will stop all but the nastiest handgun rounds, and hard armor is impervious to handguns(kind of). Rifle rounds and very high-powered handguns usually require hard armor plates. These can be made of either metal (usually steel/titanium) or ceramic. Ceramic plates, when defeated, are known to disintegrate, shatter and fall apart. Metal plates also tend to remain functional nearly indefinitely unless actually pierced, while ceramic plates will break and need replacing after a few rounds of ammunition have impacted.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The difference is that steel and other metal inserts are more multihit resistant, while ceramic has the advantage of sheer strength, and higher strength per area, as well as weight. Plates designed to stop the bigger bullets are also very bulky and not very form-fitting, thus unlikely to be worn underneath clothing. Soft armor imparts great impact, but hard armor plates are basically immune to it, only really bruising with heavier rounds from snipers.
</p><p>Fictional bulletproof vests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">may also stop blades, ice picks, or similar weapons</a>; however, in real life, soft armor vests intended only for protection against bullets are ineffective against stabbing. This is because the armor uses high-strength fiber cloth to spread out the impact of a bullet, but the point and edge of a knife can slip between the weave of the fabric and cut it open. There <em>are</em> actually vests for defending against stabs, though. There are two different stab vest styles. One is designed to protected against engineered blades, such as those belonging to knives. The other is meant to protect against spike type blades, like those typical of improvised stabbing weapons, such as screwdrivers and shivs. Most military body armor will hold up fairly well against slashing attacks, though, because the designs are meant to protect against fragments, which are flying, sharp bits of metal. Hard ballistic plates will defeat any kind of blade attack, however.
</p><p>And don't forget, when someone does get shot when wearing a vest, has been mistaken for dead, gets emotionalized over and then sits up with a bewildered look on their face, they will always, ALWAYS part their shirt to reveal the vest, usually with bullets showing in it. They will then immediately remove the vest, even if the danger might not be over.
</p><p>When bullets are stopped by things that cover very little area in addition to being unlikely to be effective if hit, yet do so by sheer force of sentimentality, that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketProtector">Pocket Protector</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield">Bulletproof Human Shield</a> is the trope when bullets are stopped by an unwilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> or bystander. If a vest is worn by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit">Badass in a Nice Suit</a>, it will overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaistcoatOfStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaistcoatOfStyle">Waistcoat of Style</a>.
</p><p>Nowadays, modern vests of various types can double as bulletproof vests by having armor plates inserted into it.

In the manga this is treated reasonably well, in that when hit with a shotgun (at long range) it hurts quite a bit, the wearer obviously bleeding through the ruined vest. One scene earlier on when the vest takes a close-range shot with a .45 caliber revolver with no effect is a little less defensible. It should be noted .45 isn't the, uh, most high-velocity hit, but, still...

One mook's vest let him take about a half dozen rounds from Kosuna's handgun at very close range and Kanta's helmet on two separate occasions protected him from <em>sniper rifle</em> fire. Basically, every part of the suits are stated to be made of some kind of Aramid (a classification of strong, heat-resistance material that Kevlar belongs to), even the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">hats</a></em>.

Duke empties his M-16 rifle into the glass, cracking it so the final bullet can pass through the hole unimpeded and kill his target. This scene is basically a rehash of one from <em>The Professional,</em> Golgo 13's first appearance in anime. In <em>The Professional</em>, Golgo 13 also shot clean through the windows of another building that was between him and his target (he couldn't shoot directly from that building because the feds were staking it out).

Only an utter monster like Bean can wear something so absurdly heavy; when Misty nudges it off a dresser, it <em>breaks her foot.</em> On top of that, Bean wears a <em>headband</em> of the same construction. It deflects a 9mm <em>contact shot.</em>

</li><li> Most modern incarnations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> have him wear batsuits that are essentially advanced suits of lightweight armor that also allow him to be as nimble as he ever is. Furthermore, in the classic comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>, the yellow ellipse bat chest symbol is explained as a psychological lure for criminals to shoot at his heavy chest armor and away from his head. Why he tends to wear a similarly bright yellow belt has never been explained.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> Batman story "The Curse of the Four Fates," one of the criminals has been told that "Metal will still your beating heart." He naturally dons a protective vest. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But he's forgotten that he has a bullet lodged in his chest from an earlier shooting. A strong blow against the vest dislodges the old bullet and drives it into his heart.</span>
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> story plays with this trope.

The last brother, who wanted to go straight when the others found him, left the gang. He died when he took his vest off to connect downed powerlines to help an emergency surgery and was gunned down by a vengeful goon. Batman and Robin acknowledge the last brother's good nature before he dies.</span>

</li><li> Played painfully realistically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Copperhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Copperhead">Copperhead</a></em>: Sheriff Bronson and her deputy wear armor that's resistant to small arms, but the previous sheriff was shot right through it with a weapon stronger than it was designed to stop. Bronson still wears the armor he died in due to lack of funds.

Joe</a></em> comics. Here they avert the "stop everything" aspect, and it is several times discussed how different firearm rounds have different levels of penetration.
</li><li> Treated fairly realistically in Matt Fraction's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a></em> run. Clint is shot at close range by Madame Masque, and despite wearing a SHIELD-issue vest he's knocked flat and is next seen in a medical ward. He outright says it felt like being hit by a truck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KidColt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KidColt">Kid Colt</a></em>: Iron Mask, Kid Colt's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, was a blacksmith who constructed a suit of bulletproof armour for his career of crime.

He confidently approaches the white spy, who is leaning on a bridge railing. The white spy tosses a large magnet off the bridge into the water below, dragging the vest and its wearer along.
</li><li> Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Punisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Punisher">Punisher</a> originally used a similar trick, wearing heavy body-armor with a white skull that drew attention - and fire &mdash; away from his head (not to mention that the symbol's "teeth" section is a handy place to have ammo clips). Later incarnations are simply too badass to die.
<ul><li> Spoofed with his parody Frank Casket (nom de guerre: the Pulveriser) in the parody comic <em>What The...?!</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pulveriser</strong>: Bet you punks can't hit the skull! <br><strong>Pulveriser's VO Box</strong>: I won the bet. My medical bills told me that after criminals, doctors would be the next to go.
</div></li><li> Played straight and slightly averted during the MAX arc <em>Up is Down and Black is White</em>, where the Punisher survives being shot at near point blank range by a shotgun with no apparent serious injuries due to his bulletproof vest. Averted in the sense that although it didn't kill him, it <em>hurt like hell</em>, and it leaves him completely unable to move until help arrived.
</li><li> Other instances can be explained by the fact that Frank has unbelievable pain tolerance.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>, Doc Brown gets shot up at the beginning of the movie.

Marty travels back to the present... just in time to see Doc get shot again. Marty runs over, mourning him... but, of course, Doc finally took the warning, and was wearing a Bulletproof Vest, which he probably modified to stop rifle fire (this type of vest won't do so in real life).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em>, Tannen watches a movie set in the Wild West where a man survives gun shots thanks to this, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> for the next sequel; In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">Back to the Future Part III</a></em>, Marty hides a stove door under his shirt just in case, and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>, acts out a scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFistfulOfDollars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AFistfulOfDollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a></em> with Mad Dog Tannon.
<ul><li> The stove piece is actual Truth in Television. During the era of the Wild West outlaws and sheriffs would occasionally don makeshift vests, and "iron shirt" if they heard an enemy was in town. The armor was typically the strongest flattest piece of steel or iron around, the back plate of a stove happened to be the perfect shape for this.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Batsuit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Batman (1989)</a></em> appears to be made of a rubber-like material. In the film's opening a random mugger empties his gun at batman and while it knocks him down, he's immediately on his feet a moment later none the worse for wear. Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em> shows that Catwoman's claws go right through.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em> establishes that the Batman's suit is a $300k body armor, so it's somewhat justified that it works pretty well. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, Bruce asks Fox to redesign the suit to be more resistant to dog bites, realistically showing a common weakness in ballistic armor. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gordon takes a bullet for the mayor while wearing a standard kevlar vest and is injured badly enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">to convince everyone he's dead</a>.

The moment Kiriyama's out of sight, however, the victim jumps to his feet and gleefully declares that he's been saved by his awesome bulletproof vest. It turns out that Kiriyama was hiding nearby while stalking someone else; he hears this and uses a katana to slice the student's head off. Kiriyama then puts on the bulletproof vest, which somehow protects him from being stabbed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigGame">Big Game</a></em>, Morris wears a bulletproof vest, although the strongest it's pitted against is an arrow. It bounces off harmlessly, even though the type of vest he's wearing doesn't stop sharp objects in reality. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Double-subverted, as the arrow managed to hit a bullet fragment embedded in the bad guy's chest, and the vest doesn't protect from the <em>force</em> of the impact, which is enough to dislodge this bullet splinter into his heart.</span>
</li><li> Notably averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown">Black Hawk Down</a></em>, when the US soldiers remove the reinforced steel plate from their kevlar body armor before the mission to lighten their load. Because past experience had led them to assume that they would not be fired upon, the soldiers chose to sacrifice protection for maneuverability. Ultimately they find themselves in a heavy fire-fight and suffer casualties that might have been prevented by the steel plating. Ultimately the real event helped create a restructuring of military policy that prohibits soldiers in combat zones from leaving behind their assigned equipment, though some still do.
</li><li> As a variation, The Ching Emperor in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingTemple">Blazing Temple</a></em> wears a sword-proof vest. It doesn't proect him from being attacked from behind by the Shaolin monk playing both sides, and didn't protect him with his throat being slit by a small dagger.

It works well against gunfire, as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em>, Batman's cowl even deflects a point-blank gunshot to the back of the his head, although it clearly still <em>hurts</em>. The same fight also show that, like a real bulletproof vest, the batsuit is less resistant to knives, since Batman gets stabbed through it.
</li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWish3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWish3">Death Wish 3</a></em>, the gang leader is revealed to be wearing a vest after Paul Kersey empties his gun at him.

He goads Ramone to shoot him in the heart, which Ramone does repeatedly to little effect. Ramone is terrified and quickly wastes all his bullets. It's portrayed pretty accurately; boiler plate, being made to handle steam boilers, <em>is</em> strong enough to block a bullet, and Joe does get knocked back from the hits. He just gets back up afterwards. Also, rifle rounds of the period, while still more powerful than pistol rounds, were round-nosed and comparable to modern-day high-power pistol rounds like a .357 magnum, which a sufficiently thick boiler plate could stop.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon3">Lethal Weapon 3</a></em>, the plot revolves around the sale of "cop killer" bullets that pierce through police armor. In one scene, a character survives by simply wearing <em>two</em> vests on top of each other.
<ul><li> Made more baffling by the fact that earlier in the same scene the bullets are shown shooting through the front plate of a bulldozer. The bullets are also demonstrated by being fired into a vest hung on a stand. The bullet easily passes through both the front and back sides of the hanging vest, thus proving the bullets could easily penetrate a double thickness of vest.

This also happens in the book, though he is stabbed by an orc and suffers a greater injury from the impact: the mithril coat prevents him from being stabbed, sure, but the sheer force from the spear thrust still knocks him out, drives the rings of the mail coat into his body and badly bruises him.

Encyclopedia and his client Herb Stein go up against a bully, sixteen-year-old Biff Logan, who stole Herb's bicycle and threatens to punch anyone in the stomach if he doesn't like them (and has carried it out a few times); Encyclopedia prepares for this encounter by donning a piece of sheet metal and covering it with his clothes. It nearly doesn't work because Biff's switched to punching in the eye after the last kid he hit couldn't eat for a week and almost starved, but Encyclopedia dupes him into aiming for the stomach instead, since that way it won't leave evidence. Biff falls for it and badly hurts his hand as a result.

<ul><li> Played straight in the same show, in the episode First in Line, Wordy is shot by the subject, and the bullet does little more than make him sit out the rest of the episode. Wordy is hit again in season 2, and is in considerable pain but still participates in the take-down of the subject at the end of the episode. Also seen in the ridiculously fast recovery of Roy Lane after being hit in the vest in "The Other Lane."

<ul><li> The series also subverts it in an episode where a defective military vest that failed to protect its user is a key plot point.
</li></ul></li><li> Right after Charlotte is introduced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> episode "Confirmed Dead," Ben shoots her.

The premier, knife sticking in his chest, falls off the dais onto a cart and cake as the U.N.C.L.E. agents rush into the room to apprehend Alexander. It is then that the premier rises from the cart, and reveals that, having been warned of the murder attempt, he was wearing body armor that saved him.

The two FBI agents escorting the captured drug dealer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> are shot by his fiance, who was on the jury as a way to free him.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Narcos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Narcos">Narcos</a></em>, bulletproof vests are not very effective, spelling disaster for Colombian politics.

The characters spend some time joking about it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until Kate is shot in the head</span>.
</li><li> In "Devil's Trifecta", an assassin shoots Fornell in the chest while he's at a fast-food drive-thru. Fortunately, Fornell was wearing a bulletproof vest because he was at an FBI take-down earlier and was too tired to take it off; not only does it save Fornell's life, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingInSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingInSelfDefense">it gives him the chance to grab his gun and shoot back</a>.
</li><li> In "Bulletproof", the team investigates a number of defective vests that were worn by soldiers who died or were crippled in combat because of the faulty vests&#146; ceramic plates shattering into shards and digging into the body upon bullet impact, making their wounds worse. The vests were from a batch that should have been destroyed, but were sold on the grey market as surplus body armor instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When confronted, the person responsible dons body armor and opens fire on Team Gibbs. Bishop is shot but survives with only bruised ribs because she was wearing a working bulletproof vest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">The perp is also shot in the vest, but because she was wearing one of the defective vests - which were worse than useless - she bleeds out</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> is very good about characters wearing their vests, as well as showing the limitations. When Kensi is shot in "Blye, K Part One", she's in a lot of pain and with obvious bruising through the next episode. She also makes reference to the shot being off-center (she was running) or the sniper bullet would have torn through the vest and killed her.
<ul><li> Averted in "Parley." The criminal assisting them is gunned down and shown to be wearing a bulletproof vest. While the vest clearly stopped the bullet, she is still badly injured and unable to get up, requiring the agents to call an ambulance for her.
</li><li> In "SEAL Hunter", Sam takes a bullet to the vest. Because he's a badass who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, he's able to keep fighting along with the rest of the team, even dealing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to a failed marine who spent the episode posing as him.

<ul><li> Depicted very realistically. Both the good guys and the bad guys survive getting shot in the vest but it knocks them out of the fight and leaves them seriously bruised afterwards.
</li><li> When Reese goes undercover as an armored truck guard, he is shot in the back. While he survives due to his vest, he loses consciousness and wakes up in the hospital. The other guard also survived getting shot in the vest but while he was lying stunned and defenseless on the ground, the bad buy finished him off.
</li><li> When Reese is fighting a sniper, he grabs the guy's sniper rifle and shoots him from close range. He is astounded when the sniper's vest absorbs the shot. The sniper's boss is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> and made the guy wear a top-of-the-line vest that can stand up to a rifle bullet. However, the sniper is still completely knocked out by the force of the bullet and is likely to have internal injuries.
</li><li> The identity-stealing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> in 'Proteus' mentions wearing body armour at one point. After Carter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">saves Finch</a> by shooting the killer, Finch mentions how good the man was at impersonating an FBI agent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">realises</a> that included the armour. Cue the man getting to his feet, <em>immediately</em> followed by Beecher shooting him in the head.
</li></ul></li><li> Mocked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reno911">Reno 911!</a></em>. The ladies are all issued new vests in the form of Kevlar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfCorsetsSexy">corsets</a>. Pleased with the amount of attention they're getting, they just pin their badge to the vest itself and go out on patrol. They're loving it until, on a drunken dare, Junior shoots at Kimball and it goes right through the vest like butter.
<ul><li> Parodied another time where the department is testing new bulletproof vests. Suffice it to say, the shot landed elsewhere.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RookieBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RookieBlue">Rookie Blue</a></em> has two incidents where officers wearing vests are shot, leaving bruising and broken ribs. Hence played fairly realistically.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SEALTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SEALTeam">SEAL Team</a></em> includes Clay's taking a hit dead center on his chest plate. He temporarily can't breathe because the impact paralyzes his diaphragm and he sustains a concussion. The large ugly bruise remains on his chest over the course of the next few episodes.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>, when Shane is shot through a door during a raid, while wearing a Kevlar vest. He is knocked down by the impact, and sustains heavy bruising from the impact (it's noted in the show that the door slowed down the bullet, which prevented him from sustaining broken ribs on top of the bruising).
</li><li> Early in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan">The Six Million Dollar Man</a></em>, one of Steve Austin's friends had developed a vest of new design and asked Austin to give it a try. The new design proved its worth later in the episode when a <em>heavy-machine-gun burst at pointblank range</em> knocked Steve down but didn't penetrate. He made a point of murmuring a "Thanks" directed at the inventor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> episode <em>Shield</em>. Clark catches a bullet just before it can hit Cat Grant, then proceeds to imbed it into her vest while pretending to tackle her to the ground, allowing him to save her life without revealing his superpowers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> In "Smoke and Mirrors," when Senator Kinsey is shot by a sniper. Anticipating the attack, he was wearing a bulletproof vest that saved his life... though the shot still dropped him like a sack of hammers, and necessitated that he be hospitalized and operated upon.
<ul><li> "Heroes Part 1" had Sgt. Siler demonstrate new body armor made to resist Jaffa weapons (the regular sort don't- in fact making it worse). A test shot blasts him clear off his feet and lightly sets him on fire, but he's able to get back up with help. The new armor saves Col. O'Neill when he's shot later on, but he still gets knocked out, and has to spend quite some time in the infirmary afterward.
<ul><li> It also saves Mitchell, when they are ambushed by the Sodan Jaffa.
</li></ul></li><li> This becomes a major plot point when Anubis' Kull Warriors are introduced. Their armor disperses energy blasts and is also made of a kevlar-like material to stop ballistics. In order to capture one, the SGC resorts to tranquilizer guns, on the logic that the darts will penetrate between the fibers, and tipped with the strongest metal in the known universe (still doesn't work because of their metabolism).
</li><li> Another episode plays with it, where toward the end O'Neill, who was clearly wearing a vest, is shot in the arm to prevent him from capturing an escaped Goa'uld. Carter reaches him, and O'Neill groans that next time, he wants sleeves on his bulletproof vest.
</li><li> Inverted in later seasons. During Earth-based operations, strike teams often wore Kevlar vests <em>over</em> their shirts instead of hiding them. Naturally, they never get shot (with bullets, anyway&mdash;and Kevlar is useless against zat'n'ktel).
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS09E02DevilMayCare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS09E02DevilMayCare">"Devil May Care" (S09, Ep02)</a>, the demons who possessed Navy soldiers put these on, which is odd since demons can only be killed by bullets from the Colt. Maybe they were trying to be nice to their meat suit.
<ul><li> The demons were working for Abaddon, who they had previously defeated by carving a devils trap into the bullet and shooting it into her. She was taking precautions to make sure it didn't happen again to either her or her followers.
</li></ul></li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger">Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger</a></em>, Commander Doggie "Boss" Kruger is shot right as he returns home from an off-world Deka meeting by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> Gigantes (AKA Hoji/Deka Blue's old friend Vino), immediately after Hoji realizes what Gigantes was up to. Fortunately, he was wearing a Bulletproof Vest and survived little less for wear (it's implied that Hoji warned Swan about Gigantes and she alerted Doggie just in time), though considering how he's shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> in later episodes, one wonders if he really needed it...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> The presenters are presented with and wear them on the first part of the Middle East special as they travel through Iraq. As they travel through the Kurdistan region, they discover it is actually quite peaceful and decide not to wear them anymore. However, when they get to the Turkish border, they are horrified to discover their poorly planned route to Bethlehem puts them back in an active warzone and so they have to don them again.
</li><li> One episode in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlue">True Blue</a></em> had two criminals rob a bank wearing full body armor, requiring the police forces to use a high-powered rifle to take down one of the criminals.
</li><li> A realistic portrayal in the otherwise very-non-naturalistic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>. Agent Cooper's life is saved by a bullet-proof vest when he is shot in the first-season cliffhanger ending, although he is wounded by one of the bullets because he had pulled the vest up to get at a wood-tick. He describes the experience as "the sensation of having three bowling-balls dropped onto your chest from a height of about nine feet.", and suffers broken ribs from the impact.
</li><li> One character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnusuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUnusuals">The Unusuals</a></em> is paranoid about dying (he's 42, his father was 42 when he died, <em>his</em> father was 42, etc.) so he always wears his vest.
</li><li> Kind of subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">Walker, Texas Ranger</a></em>, where any main character who wears a bulletproof vest will take the shot, recoil, then continue, while any secondary character or redshirt will either have the round penetrate the vest anyway via "cop killer" armor piercing bullets or just get shot in the head instead.
<ul><li> Played straight (and more realistically) in the last episode of the Chairman arc, when Trivette actually goes down from a shot to the chest. After about a minute of appearing to be dead, he manages to recover and get up. Body armor to the rescue!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> has a tendency of making bulletproof vests useless. In season 1 it's noted that while a bulletproof vest was found on one of Omar's men, it didn't do him much good against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">46 spent shell casings</a> found around him. In season 4, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> for Marlo teaches his soldiers to aim for the head if close enough, or to shoot low enough to get under where a vest would protect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And ultimate badass Omar, who seemingly never leaves home without his vest on, gets killed by a kid that shoots him in the back of the head while buying a pack of cigarettes.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>: In "Young At Heart" Scully is shot by a criminal during a sting operation, but she's saved by a hidden vest.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk2020">Cyberpunk2020</a></em> describes bulletproof vests along with bulletproof trousers and kevlar helmets as mandated protection for soldiers (and usually cops). They are portrayed quite realistically being very good against shrapnel as well as against small and medium-calibre weapons fire, but just slowing down assault rifle bullets. Heavier armor types are available but are marginally better, and of course armor-piercing bullets make short work of all types of armor.
</li><li> The bulletproof vests available in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> do not inspire confidence, but they can make the difference between dead and dying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones">Hc Svnt Dracones</a></em> a bulletproof vest has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorAsHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorAsHitPoints">hit points</a> equal to a physically weak character, but covers very little and is easily bypassed by aiming single shots. However, there are also far heavier armors.
</li><li> Flak vests (and flak helmets, jackets, pants, and suits in the expanded 2nd and 3rd editions) are the most widely available armor in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> tabletop role playing game and are actually reasonably useful against most of the common weapons a player character might face, such as slugthrower pistols and melee weapons. Once lasers and other exotic weapons come into play (particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">flamers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm">heavy needlers</a>, basic flak armor generally falls by the wayside for something sturdier.
</li><li> The second edition of the role-playing game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Recon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Recon">Recon</a></em> had a somewhat confusing discussion of body armor. In a description of a soldier getting ready for a mission, he chooses not to take body armor, it being "useless dead weight". However, he does volunteer to carry the squad's machinegun ammo belts, because they provide good protection from bullets. (The rules didn't actually rate ammo belts as protection.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Expatriette</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em> can wear one (it's called a Flak Jacket in game). It has the effect of completely nullifying any attack that does three or more points of damage before being discarded. This includes everything from mundane gunfire to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">9999 damage</a> energy blast from the setting's universe-destroying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.

</div></li><li> Body armor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> just gives you a better chance of shrugging off injury, rather than actually preventing damage per se. Unless one has a ridiculously high Body attribute (easily gained by, say, being a Troll), just one layer of ballistic armor won't cut it against anything above light pistol fire. But that's civilian- and security-grade armour. Military-grade armor makes one totally immune to anything of too low a penetrating power, but still does not save one against being shot with an Assault Cannon set to full-auto.
</li><li> Flak jackets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> are standard equipment for basic Imperial Guard units. They're nicknamed "T-shirts" because they're so flimsy in comparison to the much heavier armors available in the game.
<ul><li> In the RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em>, guardsman flak is actually one of the best armours that can be obtained regularly. Mesh armour is a little worse, but weighs around 2kg for a full-body suit (and is ridiculously hard to get without the right connections), carapace armour is heavier and a little stronger (and about equally hard to get) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour">Powered Armour</a> finally means pretty much nothing short of anti-vehicle/anti-materiel even can touch you - if you can get your hands on a set and are not too distraught about the civilian capacitors only lasting for between one and five hours of operation... Still, against normal weapons (autoguns and lasguns), flak armour works pretty well.
</li><li> Imperial Guard flak armour shines through in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OnlyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OnlyWar">Only War</a></em>. In fact, it's even better this time round, because you can acquire it right from the get-go if you choose/create the right regiment for your characters, and upgrading the armour to Good Craftsmanship is relatively inexpensive - even Best Craftmanship is somewhat reasonable. This is countered by the fact that should your regiment not specify full Imperial Flak on creation, then they start with just the vest and helmet, leaving your arms and legs vulnerable.
</li><li> Flak Armor has been stated to be impervious to bullets from stubbers, resistant to autogun fire, and might save you from a lasblast, if it's a glancing hit. Considering that Imperial Autoguns fire 8.25x56mm <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2krmv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2krmv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2krmv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> this is estimated from the 820 meters per second muzzle velocity and 8.25mm caliber</span> bullets with muzzle velocity slightly lower than the average 7.62x51, it's actually arguably better than modern armor. Of course, there's also the theory of the entire uniform being to that standard of stubber immunity, which would mean that the entire uniform is made up of ballistic textiles capable of shrugging off bullets from modern rifles, and that the hard portions are quite possibly able to take a hit from a HMG at some angles. Something to think about.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Games&nbsp;</div><div id="folder8" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em>7.62 High Calibre</em> has several types of armor and helmets available. The first one available, the M200 Concealable Vest, is stated as being suitable for stopping small caliber ammunition. Unfortunately, 50% of the bandits you're likely to run across are carrying sawed-off Mosin Nagants, which fire a (admittedly slower velocity) 7.62x54mm rifle round, meaning the vest is almost worthless. Later vests are slightly better at stopping higher caliber ammunition, and can include ceramic or titanium inserts for better protection (ceramic is stronger, but breaks after a few shots, while titanium is weaker, but more durable). There's also a game setting that can be toggled on so that vests actually provide full body protection. Otherwise, in addition to considering how heavy and protective a vest is, you also have to take into account just how much of your body that vest actually covers.
<ul><li> Vests are also depicted very realistically: they can only protect from a handful of shots, some damage can still get through, and even if they protect you from any damage you'll still get stunned by the impact. The concealable vests without the ability to accept plates are especially weak, and typically they're only good enough to protect the victim from being instantly killed or incapacitated. And since they don't last forever, your mercs will need to constantly buy, find, or scavenge new vests (hope you missed the armor when you killed that soldier!).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol">Alpha Protocol</a></em>, bulletproof vests are generic sources of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoint">Hit Points</a>, which also block knives and fists and explosions. You can also convince <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ronald Sung</span> to wear a bulletproof vest if you uncover a plan to assassinate him. Doing so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">will save him from being killed by a sniper with a high-powered rifle, which makes one wonder just how much kevlar was in that vest.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyMen">Army Men</a></em> series, Sarge can pick up "flak jackets", which take up an equipment slot and reduce damage until destroyed. Though in real life, "flak jackets" were too bulky for regular troops.
<ul><li> Not an issue, as <em>Army Men</em> is about the little green plastic kind of army men (Who shoot the little tan, red, and blue plastic kind of army men) and never pretends to be any more accurate about details than a toy would be.
</li></ul></li><li> Huge, heavy, and customized battle armor is worn by both Rios and Salem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyOfTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyOfTwo">Army of Two</a></em>. This includes steel masks to protect the face.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em>, James Gordon takes a bullet for Warden Joseph during the climax. While it clearly still hurts, he gets back up and is still in good enough shape to fight side-by-side with Batman.
<div class="indent"><strong>Warden Joseph:</strong> Thank God you had your vest on.
</div></li><li> A certain type of soldier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlakeStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlakeStone">Blake Stone</a>: Aliens of Gold</em> wears a bullet-proof vest; the machine gun-type weapons are the only ones that can hurt them. And even then, the first burst only knocks the soldier down, and you have to wait until he gets back up to finish the job. Makes you wonder what Blake himself is wearing.
</li><li> Just like in real life, kevlar armors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> do little more than increasing your firefight life expectancy from 2 seconds to 3 seconds. Kevlar helmets, meanwhile, are only effective against pistols and <em>maybe</em> against 5.56 mm rifles.
<ul><li> See <a class="urllink" href="http://www.schuzak.jp/other/dmgchart.html">this list<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for all weapons stats. Basically, every weapon has a pre-assigned damage value for each part with and without armor. Against grenades and most sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistol it can reduce damage by 40-50%, but only reduces damage from rifles by about 20-30% and does basically nothing against sniper rifles.
</li><li> Armor does however prevent aimpunch (meaning you crosshair isn't randomly thrown off when you get shot) making it a crucial buy.
</li></ul></li><li> Escape From Tarkov is... Weird about this. Due to it using a mix of realism and balance, armour is in a strange place. Add to that the armour having no distinction frm hard plate areas to soft armour zones, and the arms, torso, are suddnely encased in GOST 6A body armour, when the plate is merely a thorax protective.
</li><li> Played fairly realistically in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em>. All of the American soldiers and about half of the North Korean soldiers wear kevlar vests, helmets, and ceramic plating on their torsos. Rather than simply giving them more health, as in most other FPS games, <em>Crysis</em> actually models subsystem damage as well as velocity loss over range for the sake of verisimilitude. For reference, the basic rifle-caliber firearms (FY-71, SCAR, Hurricane, Shi Ten) deal 90 to 120 damage, and lose 0.1 points of damage for every 1 meter past 50 meters (meaning that at, say, 300 meters, they lose 25 damage per shot). By default, shots to the head deal 5000% damage (i.e. instant kill), torso shots 120%, leg/arm shots 65%, and feet/hand shots 30%. Body armor reduces the torso damage multiplier from 120% to 75%, meaning that North Korean soldiers (who have from 180 to 250 health points) go from taking one or two assault rifle bullets to the torso kill to taking two to six, depending on the soldier, caliber, and distance. <em>However</em>, body armor obviously does not affect the multipliers to the legs, head, and hands, as those parts of the body remain exposed (except for the helmet which is only designed to stop shrapnel and pistol rounds and would be useless against a rifle anyway).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">F.E.A.R.</a></em>, the player can pick up protective helmets and vests which not only protect him from pistol rounds, but also from rifled rounds, shotgun blasts, explosives and laser guns! However, melee attacks still do a great deal of damage. All of the standard Replica Soldiers and ATC guards wear armor too, ranging from only soft vests to vests backed with ceramic plating to stop rifle rounds.
</li><li> Body armor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline">Girls Frontline</a></em> can only be equipped by shotguns (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualFighter">M16A1</a>). They increase the armor stat at the cost of evasion, which isn't important for shotguns anyway. Since armor directly subtracts the damage taken, a shotgun equipped with decent body armor can essentially shrug off anything smaller than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">Jaeger</a> fire, making them excellent against general enemy formations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a> 2</em> has bulletproof vests as a reward for completing the diamond smuggling crime ring. They only reduce damage and don't guard the head or limbs; fortunately, this also applies to mooks wearing them. As a result, you can kill armoured mooks much faster by going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">Boom, Headshot!</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nightfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nightfire">NightFire</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters">TimeSplitters</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em> you can pick up a bulletproof vest that essentially acts as a second health bar. Headshots still hurt, though.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> uses an energy shield that has the same effect, except that it does block head shots.
</li><li> Additionally, <em>Nightfire</em> plays it with surprising realism. It's only durable against handguns and small semi-automatics like the Storm M32. One sniper round or shotgun blast is enough to wipe out half the armor; another shot will erase it completely <em>and</em> take some of your regular health with it. Obviously, you're <em>dead meat</em> against explosives and grenades.
</li></ul></li><li> All the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> games have body armor that act as a second health bar. Depending on the game, it won't protect you from drowning, hunger, car explosions (while inside them) and high falls.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a></em> games come with a range of body armour, helmets and, in Jagged Alliance 2, armoured trousers, as well as handy chemicals with which to reinforce them. These range from the common or garden flak jacket and steel helmet, which is about as effective as putting on an extra T-shirt, to full-body <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_molecular_weight_polyethylene">Spectra<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which will let you survive a point-blank burst from an M16 with only multiple flesh wounds (and sudden severe exhaustion on account of having the wind knocked out of you). There's also a kevlar-reinforced leather biker jacket, which is the only body armour upgrade one character will agree to wear.
<ul><li> <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em> also allows various attachments to armour like knee protectors and armour plate inserts. Full SWAT gear with inserts and no damage gives an insane amount of damage resistance that can make non-armour-piercing rounds do 0 damage if they hit. You don't even want to <em>know</em> how much damage the EOD Suits can resist. Really.
<ul><li> Note that all body armour bring stat penalties for wearing it. Heavier armour, use of chemicals, ceramic or titan plates increase the effect.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> and its sequel has the Flak Jacket, the Kevlar Jacket, and the Kevlar Jacket &Omega;, which can be bought in succession and provide a 25%, 50%, and 75% reduction in damage respectively.
</li><li> A good number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> games feature body armor that gives 50% damage reduction, but not invincibility. It started in the <em>X</em> series, and in some games gave a new weapon, but later spread out into the other series.
</li><li> Snake can find a bulletproof vest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> which cuts all damage taken in half while it's equipped. It is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown">fairly useless</a> as it's far more economic to keep rations equipped which automatically get used if your health reaches zero.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em>, Raiden's sword easily damages Solidus Snake through his armored suit, although the sword is, itself, made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Phlebotinum.</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em> gives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raiden some karmic payback;</span> the non-metal parts of his armor don't stop Vamp's blades. Minutes before is a subversion, if a thin one; Old Snake, unseen by the enemy, takes the time to line up a perfect shot with his M4 on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vamp's un-armored</span> head. His shot hits dead-center in the forehead, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vamp, effectively immortal,</span> spins around once as a startled reaction to the momentum, lands on one knee, <em>catches his cell phone from falling</em> to finish talking, gives his troops an order, and then informs them he'll be "taking a nap" before falling over dead. He re-animates shortly thereafter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> has several tiers of body armor, ranging from the classic bulletproof vest to a fully decked-out suit of ceramic-plated armor. Heavier armor offers more protection, while lighter armor lets you move faster and possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DodgeTheBullet">dodge bullets</a>. Like in real life, armor offers little protection from melee attacks and is vulnerable to high-caliber sniper fire; <em>unlike</em> real life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingShieldStaticHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingShieldStaticHealth">it can repair itself after a few seconds in cover</a>.
<ul><li> On the cops' side, Maximum Force Response units have ceramic chestplates that are completely invulnerable to normal gunfire. Their helmets, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">are not so bulletproof</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal">Postal</a> 2</em> has Kevlar and Ceramic Armor, which reduce damage until destroyed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> franchise plays the bulletproof vest trope fairly realistically, even in the more action oriented games, such as Vegas. Light body armor will not save a player from most types of gunfire, and armor that can reliably stop bullets is bulky and slows the wearer down.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Rebecca Chambers wears one which effectively stops a bullet, but is otherwise realistically useless against the monster slashing slaws. The fifth game plays with this by allowing different types of armor for gunshots and knife attacks.
</li><li> As does Brad Vickers who wears a bright yellow ballistic vest, the type meant to resist debris kicked up by blasts and which fits a metal or ceramic plate over center-of-mass front and back. It makes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">zombified self</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> highly resistant to your guns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge">notoriously difficult to kill</a>, unless you put two-and-two together and let him bite onto your foot after knocking him down which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">lets you kill him in one hit by stomping his unprotected head</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a>: Chaos Theory</em> actually plays this quite realistically; if Sam triggers two or more alarms, guards will don body armor and helmets. While the armor is relatively effective against his rifle and renders his pistol practically useless except for headshots below the helmets' brims, his knife goes straight through their armor, and his nonlethal unarmed attacks, which aim for the base of the skull or nose, still knock enemies unconscious.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunsetRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunsetRiders">Sunset Riders</a></em>, kind of. All bosses can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">take some 20 bullets</a> before dying; the final boss takes about 30, then his bulletproof vest falls out, and then he needs 30 more before he drops.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4">SWAT 4</a></em> has you and your team wear light Kevlar vests and helmets by default. You can take heavy armor in multiplayer, and the expansion pack allows you use no armor if you so please. AI-controlled suspects also get armor in some missions, again just kevlar vests; the bulk of them just go around in their clothes though. Due to the game being big on realism, the vests (not being hard rifle-proof plates) can stop only a few pistol rounds and are as useful as paper against rifles. Notably, the game also lets you pick whether to use FMJ or JHP rounds, with the former being more effective against suspects in bulletproof vests, but slightly less effective at inflicting wounds and prone to overpenetrating walls, which could potentially lead to civilians getting hit accidentally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> plays this fairly realistically. The player always comes equipped with a flak jacket which will completely protect you from bullets until destroyed, with headshots being the only exception. Armored enemies, on the other hand, can be damaged by shots to the extremities, and can be taken down with headshots. This is usually how you want to kill them, since you can take their flak jackets to restore your armor.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM">XCOM</a></em> games unarmoured soldiers will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">die with disgusting ease</a>. Personal Armour and even Power Armour is available but by the time it's in use, most aliens are packing weapons which will still inflict lethal damage no matter how heavy the armour, and mobile nightmare objects the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Chryssalids</a> ignore armour anyway.
<ul><li> Primarily because the RNG is horrible/evil, and your soldiers can take up to <em>200%</em> of the listed damage shown in the UFOpaedia. On the other hand, they can also take <em>0%</em> of the listed damage, depending on what the RNG rolls. So your troopers can literally survive a point blank headshot without taking a single point of damage. Sometimes, the RNG only ever rolls 200s or 0s. This can lead to interesting situations where a soldier survives half a dozen heavy plasma shots only to get pinged to death by a plasma pistol shot the next turn.
</li><li> <em>Apocalypse</em>, the third game in the series, breaks from the mold of the previous two by giving your characters armor at the beginning of the game, rather than forcing you to send your troops into battle wearing cloth jumpsuits. However, the armor <em>still isn't very effective</em>: the aliens will start the game firing Brainsuckers at your troops, which are completely unfazed by armor, and spitting acid, which the armor isn't effective against. In addition, the armor either slows soldiers down (standard Marsec armor), or is prohibitively expensive while being barely more protective (flying armor).

<ul><li> The phrase "bulletproof vest" is often a misnomer. Many military vests or helmets, particularly those made before the modern era, are actually intended to prevent injury from the fragmentation cast about by explosions. Some observers have commented that helmets or vests were "useless" because they did not stop rifle ammunition. This is a fallacy, as most injuries in warfare are caused by fragmentation, against which helmets and armor were rather effective.
<ul><li> The term "proof" historically referred to being tested (as in proof reading), not being invulnerable &mdash; indeed, it is so statistically difficult to say that any piece of armor is guaranteed to stop a given bullet that vests usually report what test loadings the vest has a 50% chance of stopping. The shift in meaning has led to conscientious makers and writers calling the vests "bullet resistant".
</li><li> Like any other type of armor, ballistic armor is not supposed to prevent you from being hurt; it's to prevent you from being <em>killed</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nij.gov/topics/technology/body-armor/Pages/standards.aspx">Not all body armor is created equal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Different levels are made to resist different calibers of ammunition; Levels I, IIA, II, and IIIA will resist most pistol rounds, but only levels III and IV will resist rifle rounds.
</li><li> Anti-ballistic armor works by dispersing the force applied to the person by the bullet across a wide area of the body, preventing the bullet from piercing the body and wreaking havoc on blood vessels and organs. Compare the lethality of fists with knives: They deliver about the same amount of energy to the target, but the latter attacks a much smaller area. For the same reason, bullet resistant armor protects nicely against shrapnel produced by fragmentation explosives like typical grenades, but is far less effective against an explosion itself (which will apply the same amount of force anyway).
</li><li> Modern military body armor:
<ul><li> The Soviet Union did perhaps more than any other nation in the development of the modern military body armor, especially thanks to the development of three specific pieces. The 6B2 (6&#1041;2) was introduced in March of 1979. While it used the traditional flack jacket formula of metal plates and aramid fibres, it set the style for future armors, vests, and plate carriers by having solid front and rear sides, and being donned over the head and adjusted by straps on the shoulders.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://ra.spetsnaz.su/wiki/6B3">6B3<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (6&#1041;3) and <a class="urllink" href="http://ra.spetsnaz.su/wiki/6B4">6B4<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (6&#1041;4) were introduced in the summer of 1979, and were revolutionary advances in body armor. These were the first widely-used systems to offer more than just protection. They came with integrated pockets for magazines, grenades, and other items. They had projections on the shoulders to allow soldiers to comfortably sling weapons and equipment over their shoulders without it falling off, the vests could be adjusted from both the shoulders and sides, and they were modular, with a baseline amount of soft armor integrated into the vests, with the option for soldiers to add more or less armor as they wished, thanks to using smaller plates housed in internal pockets, meaning that protection could be precisely tailored and taking a hit did not necessitate replacement of all the armor. The supplemental armor plates were also made of materials which would become global mainstays. The 6&#1041;3 used titanium plates and the 6&#1041;4 used ceramic plates. Lastly, the 6&#1041;3 was the first vest in the world to be widely supplied with camouflage covers which could easily be added and removed as needed in the field.
</li></ul></li><li> U.S. soldiers in Iraq have reported being hit by rifle fire and not knowing they were hit, due to the modern heavy body armor they are wearing. Many injuries are due to explosives, which pierce the armor, or more often, damage parts of the body which are not protected. The force of the blast also is not reduced by much, which can cause brain damage when the brain is bruised against the skull. However, such body armor can only withstand one or two hits - at medium range.
</li><li> The effectiveness of body armor is highly underestimated. As <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7321647.stm">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> article demonstrates, modern body armor can receive a full-contact grenade blast.
</li><li> Many army medics in Iraq reported that soldiers who survived an IED blast would often have shrapnel injuries on the limbs that would stop in a very neat line where their body armor started.
</li><li> The latest trend in body armor? Ballistic shorts which provide coverage to the groin area. This being intended to address a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">major problem</a> for troops riding in vehicles that roll over landmines or IEDs. Various styles are being evaluated, including "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.stripes.com/blogs/stripes-central/stripes-central-1.8040/ballistic-boxers-might-just-save-your-tail-1.122993">ballistic boxers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" to shorts made from more conventional body armor materials. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Puns</a> abound, obviously.
<ul><li> This is just formalizing what some soldiers have jerry-rigged for decades. Many US Army helicopter crews in Vietnam were issued flak jackets. Since helicopters were mostly shot at from below, the jackets were often used as seat cushions rather than worn conventionally. Bomber crews during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> would often do the same with <em>their</em> flak jackets for similar reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> Several variations of armor are used by US personnel, the most common ESAPI stopping two 30.06 AP hits, while the best stopping three M993 hits.
</li></ul></li><li> A black joke appreciated by British troops in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">Northern Ireland</a> (and probably today in the Sandpit) is that wearing the issue flak jacket/protective armour ensures that if you are blown up by a terrorist bomb, at least the jacket will keep enough of you together in the same place afterwards to justify a coffin at your funeral, and make it easier for Forensics to identify the bits. So always paint your name on the flak jacket to make sure your family get the right corpse.
</li><li> A primitive version of such a vest is reputed to have been used by tax-gatherers. It consisted of a plank of wood hanging under the clothes on their back, and apparently it was not unknown for them to go about their business with arrows sticking out of it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NedKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NedKelly">Ned Kelly</a>, outlaw and Australian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero">Folk Hero</a>, is famous for his standoff with the police with him and his gang dressed in body armor made out of plow parts. Unfortunately for the gang, they didn't armor their legs and only Ned survived to sit trial...
</li><li> The infamous shootout in North Hollywood persisted because the two robbers were well-armored. Police, unable to penetrate their armor with their service pistols and shotguns, nonetheless put up great resistance without any loss of life; several officers also went to a nearby gunshop to procure rifles that could penetrate the armour. Then the SWAT team arrived. Like Ned Kelly above, these guys suffered from both a lack of mobility and leg protection, which is how they got cornered. Phillips eventually committed suicide (and was shot in the spine with a rifle) after his gun jammed and he was shot in the arm. Matasareanu was crippled by gunfire to his legs and died before aid reached him.
</li><li> People who make chainmail as a hobby can make good money not only by making costume-armor for Renaissance fairs but also selling mail vests to police officers looking for greater knife-protection than what their standard-issue body armor provides. However, according to research carried out by the British army in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1">WW1</a>, chainmail will actually make a gunshot worse. It's not strong enough to stop a bullet and will actually fragment, carrying more shrapnel into the body, as well as making it hard to reach the wound for treatment. Additionally, any stabs that do get through the chainmail will drive part of the mail into the wound, which can easily lead to infection. Also, while high quality chainmail coupled with effective padding is effectively knife proof, lower grade chain is not.
<ul><li> Chainmail is also pretty heavy and cumbersome as it hangs from the shoulders. Thin steel panels are much lighter and provide comparable knife protection.
<ul><li> Modern aluminum alloys are stronger than low-grade steel and weigh one-third as much. Titanium weighs 2/3rds as much as steel and is stronger by weight but not volume; however, unlike aluminum, which can be reasonably priced, titanium is ludicrously expensive&mdash;until the FFC Cambridge process enters the public domain in 2018, soon after which the bottom will drop out of the titanium market. We may be due for a maille-armor re-renaissance.
</li><li> The popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SocietyForCreativeAnachronism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SocietyForCreativeAnachronism">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> song "I'll See Your Six" tells of Sir Trude, the first of the Lady Knights, who wore her SCA armor home through the streets of New York City. She was accosted by a mugger and his three cronies...whose switchblade failed to so much as faze her due to the heavy chain-mail she wore. All four were chased off when she responded by drawing and brandishing a three foot broadsword at them that they hadn't noticed her carrying earlier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster">Mugging the Monster</a> at its finest as well as an example of how chain-mail can at the very least reduce damage from blade slashes.
</li><li> A very similar story is told about an early 90s Russian LARP enthusiast who wore a chainmail shirt under his jacket. Only in that case, the story has a punchline: the muggers thought that the "victim" was Duncan McLeod the Immortal because of the guy's immunity to knives and him carrying a sword.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Silk armor:
<ul><li> Silk was used in various items of medieval armour, notably by the Samurai and the Mongol warriors. Though it wouldn't stop a blade or arrow, rather than being cut it would stretch and be pushed into the wound allowing for easier extraction of arrowheads which would otherwise require (probably fatal) surgery or result in (also probably fatal) infections.
</li><li> When he was shot dead in 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was wearing a silk bullet-proof vest. These vests were starting to become obsolete due to faster bullets, but the point was moot because he was shot in the throat. In other words, if he had worn a bulletproof scarf, he could have saved thousands.
</li><li> A new method of making <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/676644/thai-university-develops-silk-bullet-proof-vest">bulletproof vests with layers of silk<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was adopted by the Thai police, in an effort to reduce costs in having to import kevlar by using their own Thai silk instead.
<ul><li> Thailand is a rare case of a country using silk because it is cheaper for them to do so, since they have a thriving silk production industry.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishAmericanWar">the USA's campaign to subjugate the Philippines</a>, natives would wrap thick ropes around themselves as armor against the the standard .38 Long Colt revolver round the Army had at the time. This led the Army to temporarily bring the Single Action Army in .45 Colt back into service, and led to the development of the more powerful .38 Special round and the M1911 pistol with its even more powerful .45 ACP rounds. The ropes actually didn't provide much protection against bullets, but they did restrict circulation, making it take longer to bleed to death from bullet wounds.
</li><li> During the 1920s/30s, a typical bulletproof vest worn by a bank robber or bootlegger was just a vest with thick layers of cotton padding and cloth. These vests, up to 20 layers of cotton, with a few thin steel plates, were still quite effective against the standard issue .38 Special revolvers used by most police officers at the time. One rather well known hitman was killed while wearing one by a officer using a BAR, essentially a light machine gun.
<ul><li> These vests had a very unfortunate consequence for the criminals wearing them: to not lose the police market to Colt and a M1911 pistol variant chambered for the proprietary .38 Super round (that <em>could</em> pierce those bulletproof vests), Smith &amp; Wesson and Winchester developed the .357 Magnum round (including armour-piercing variants) with the Registered Magnum revolver, renamed the Model 27 in 1957. The bulletproof vest disappeared very quickly.
</li><li> Also worth noting, many types of ammo were less powerful than their modern-day counterparts, due to newer guns being made of stronger materials. Very important if you buy a vintage gun and try loading it with modern ammunition, which can easily overpressurize the firing chamber and cause the gun to explode.
</li></ul></li><li> Scientists from China, the US, and Switzerland developed a body armor made from <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/March/16031001.asp">cotton t-shirts<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>. The process involves soaking the shirts in a boron/nickel catalyst, then heating them to over 2,000 degrees Farenheit, which turns the fibers into boron carbide, the third-hardest material on Earth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Nobody Doesn't Like Molten Boron?</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Not as effective as it sounds</a>, because the material's hardness means it would fracture where softer materials like steel would bend against similar impacts.
</li><li> In Mexico, there is a clothes designer who specializes in making very stylish, bulletproof sports jackets, coats, T-shirts and the likes which cannot be easily visually distinguished from their normal brethren.
</li><li> Dragon Skin armor was an armor made by Pinnacle, which went under afer a massive controversy, where they claimed superior multiple and high power hit protection to standard armor, but the military reported massive issues such as over twice the weight, and horrible reliability issues. The point is now moot due to the fact that armors today achieve better protection than both the IBA and the DS armor.
</li><li> Bulletproof armor is much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">than steam</a>. Back in the Middle Ages, the invention of firearms didn't immediately end the use of armor. Blacksmiths actually shot their own armor, showing their customers that the armor would protect them &mdash; The marks left by the bullets being deflected off the plate would be the 'proof' of the armor's ability to stop bullets. However, the steel plating used in typical infantry armor did get almost twice as thick up until about 1600. This still wasn't enough to keep pace with the developments in musket power, so in the 17th century infantry slowly began abandoning armor altogether. Even for cavalry, a full suit of knight-style armor got too heavy and expensive to be practical. But as they could take a heavier loadout with them than infantry heavy cavalry compromised on slowly decreasing the amount of armor being worn, and armor survived in the form of breastplates worn by heavy cavalry (and cuirassiers in particular) in many countries throughout the 19th century and into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW1">WW1</a>. While it was vulnerable to medium and short-range musket fire during the Napoleonic Wars, it was effective against swords, lances, and bayonets, and also had a great psychological effect on both cuirassiers and the enemy.
<ul><li> Also note that throughout this period, the armor had exactly the same problems the modern variant does: it was more often than not ineffective at stopping a musket ball at short range, but with some luck protected against attacks at larger ranges, or with pistols or non-firearm weapons.
