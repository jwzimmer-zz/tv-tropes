</p><p>Or to put it another way, every hero worth his salt must be physically attractive, or at the very least, better-looking than half of other people his or her age.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood">Always Lawful Good</a> races will almost <em>always</em> play this straight, sometimes to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace">inhuman beauty</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>: If you're attractive (or at least ordinary) without looking downright creepy, then you're likely a member of Class-E in one way or another. The only exception to this seems to be Koro-sensei and the four 3-E delinquents (not counting Karma). It's even lampshaded when two girls in a higher-ranking class note that 3-E's PE teacher, the young government agent Karasuma, is rather attractive, and that all of the guys and teachers in their class are ugly and mean.
<ul><li> Koro-sensei's appearance plays with this trope. His face will change from "good" to "evil" (pitch black for extreme anger) if anyone tries to push his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> (hurting his students or seeing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itona Horibe's tentacles</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in Takaoka: his cartoony (well, more cartoony) smiley face masks a vicious streak a mile wide.
</li><li> The doctor who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turned an extremely skilled but still human assassin into the superhuman Koro-sensei</span> looks rather attractive at first; then he starts referring to his secret human test subject as a disposable guinea pig ("he doesn't have a family registry so it doesn't matter if he dies"), smashes a vial of <em>something</em> on an assistant's head, and strikes his other assistant/slave/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wife via arranged pity-marriage</span> on the head with a computer tablet <em>repeatedly</em>. By the time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the (first/original) God of Death</span> KO's him through a solid plexiglass barrier his good looks have gone a bit off.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a>: Innocence</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii">the director</a> laments that he asked the animators to make sure a young female character was <em>NOT</em> cute. But they just couldn't help themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> examples (basic fact: since about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> nearly all major characters were relatively beautiful unrelated to their alignment. Even the franchises' morally ambiguous masked men hardly ever wear them to hide ugly scars and the like.
<ul><li> The most obvious subversion would be Dozle Zabi. While the ugliest of the Zabi family by far, he's also probably the nicest aside from Garma. His final act in the One Year War is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> to buy time for his wife and daughter to get to safety.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>: When OZ goes to apprehend Duo's space shuttle, Lady Une muses that they should kill the pilot if he's attractive but let him live if he's ugly. Her reason: they can use an ugly pilot as a scapegoat when they do bad stuff; but if the pilot is handsome, the people would be more likely to sympathize and follow him. Her orders, however, are just to kill him. In the actual series, everyone is attractive <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rze2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1rze2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rze2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Well, OK, except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a> who trained the pilots. </span>, so it's the same difference.
</li><li> Many of the Gundam series also feature this distinction between the heroes' Gundams and the bad guy's mobile suits. The Gundams almost always have a very humanoid appearance and more human-like faces. The bad guy's mobile suits typically almost always are more mechanical and aggressive looking, such as the cyclopean Zakus and many other Zeon mobile suits, and machines like the walking tank Anf of Gundam 00.

However, note that almost all of the "grotesque but benevolent" mutants in the X-canon are male. There's a definite double standard there. And they're still frequently drawn as being generically attractive.
<ul><li> In an arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a></em>, one of the characters, Karma, was possessed by the evil Shadow King, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakesYouUgly">who caused her to become morbidly obese from overeating</a>. In the following arc (after Karma rejoins the team), Karma is promptly (and conveniently) dropped into a desert where she sheds her fat in record time and becomes hot again.
</li><li> Perhaps the biggest X-Men example is Marrow, a Morlock with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftianSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftianSuperpower">Lovecraftian Superpower</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWithTheBone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWithTheBone">pulling her own bones out to use as weapons.</a> She first appeared as a terrorist; she was distinctly unattractive, with random bones sticking out of her body and skin like a prune. Marrow was later plucked from obscurity and reimagined as a member of the X-Men, but the writer apparently didn't like the idea of having an ugly woman on the team. To fix this, he had her get badly injured during an off-world mission, which led to her being revived via an advanced alien medical device. The procedure had the convenient side effect of transforming Marrow from a hideous freak into a pouty-lipped babe with flawless skin, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Gambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Gambit">Gambit</a> speculating that the machine had given her more control over her mutation. She still had the bones sticking out, but those were eventually done away with too in the later <em>Weapon X</em> series. When she returned to villainy years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em>, she went back to having a homely appearance (though not <em>nearly</em> as ugly as her original look).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a></em> number 47 (entitled "My Heart for the Highlands"), several of the team find themselves in 14th century Scotland and fight on behalf of Robert the Bruce. Afterward, Doug Ramsey has a question, and the answer implies this trope:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Doug:</strong> Pardon my asking sir, but&mdash;Aren't you afraid of us? We pop up out of nowhere, wielding fantastic powers. You've only our word that we're not demons or worse. <br><strong>Robert the Bruce:</strong> True Douglas&mdash;But any hadesspawn able to assume so young an innocent, an' noble a seeming deserves our respect rather than our fear&mdash;for that demon has become more human than most men.
</div></li><li> In the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the only two conventionally-attractive members, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, were also the only members who weren't actually evil, and soon did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>, the distinction between in-group (elves) and out-group (humans and trolls) has been striking from the get-go. Elves are the embodiment of otherworldly beauty, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreUgly">Humans Are Ugly</a> and idiosyncratic and trolls are bulbous and warty. While a few humans and the occasional troll are easy on the eyes, they are nothing compared to the elves &mdash; even evil elves, even genocidal elves, they're never ugly. See, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">humans are</a> the enemy and trolls are untrustworthy, but "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">All elves are one</a>". You can kill humans and trolls in self-defense, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">Elves Don't Kill Elves</a> no matter the provocation. Recent years have seen these principles change. More and more humans have been joining the list of allies, so the in-group/out-group distinction is weakening significantly. The "Elves Don't Kill Elves" prohibition has been broken on a few occasions and no longer elicits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">agonizing guilt</a> that Strongbow felt over Kureel (the first such killing). Now that Wendy Pini isn't [always] doing the art herself, certain artists draw humans all but indistinguishable from elves (which means as beautiful as elves). They look so similar that a human wearing ceremonial elf ears leaves you wondering, not about the ears, but if his <em>thumb and four fingers</em> are a mistake &mdash; a confusion that would never have been possible in the early books. The whole thing is at least mildly justified, anyway: elves are a different <em>species</em> from both humans and trolls, usually have access to healing magic that the latter don't, and their ancestors deliberately took forms that would appeal to humans in preparation for making contact (they just didn't count on getting thrown thousands of years backwards in time and losing most of their magic in the process). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has it that the Wolfriders, the tribe who had to fight humans most often, even went out of their way to deliberately prevent or eliminate <em>scars</em> whenever possible in order to present a more formidable face to their enemies, who'd just have been encouraged by the notion that their weapons could actually leave marks on the 'forest spirits'.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Alien</a> civilisation in the story has 'a psyche that is their form' and anyone significantly hideous is invariably murderous, stupid and evil. The planet the Doctor has landed on is their form of an 'asylum', a planet where the suns give out a special radiation that allows these people to live normal lives. The Doctor cluelessly helps them off the planet, and when they're away in the spaceship they transform into horrible monsters - the Doctor then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">tricks them back into returning to the planet for their own good</a> and cries about it in the final panel. It's pretty grim for a strip aimed at eight-year-olds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> are pretty bad for this. If a character shows up in a comic who looks mean or ugly, you can bet dollars to donuts he's a rotten guy with no redeeming traits. Ethel Muggs started out as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Abhorrent Admirer</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> and was pretty hard on the eyes, but as the comics have gone on she's been redesigned to be quite pretty along with being a much nicer and likable person (<a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/ethel_muggs_6176.jpeg">compare her old and new designs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>). The only subversion to this is Cheryl Blossom because she's played up as a rival and enemy of Betty and Veronica, and she's not <em>that</em> bad to begin with since she's basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> who does have some genuinely redeeming qualities.
</li><li> Prevalent, if only subtly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>.

If she <em>does</em> come up against a beautiful female villain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> will often come into play, especially during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">the Golden Age</a>. On the other had, one of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">arch-enemies</a> the God of War Ares, who is usually depicted as a sinister red-eyed armored figure whose evil children happen to look ugly because of their parentage, is revealed to be <a class="urllink" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6535/5822352-aresrebirth.png">very handsome underneath<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Reborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Reborn">Reborn</a></em>, individuals are reborn in the afterlife in fantastical new forms depending on whether they are good or evil. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroine">Bonnie</a> turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">young and voluptuous blonde woman</a> upon dying of old age in the human world and ending up in the next one while her best friend Estelle turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner">tall and beautiful fairy queen</a>. On the other hand, evil people turn into Darklanders, who range from ugly to outright demonic: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Lord Golgotha</a> (who used to be a serial killer on Earth) looks like a grey skinned demon and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> from Bonnie's high school becomes a cybernetic abomination.

<ul><li> Made explicit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em>. All three characters are unscrupulous to some degree, but the most conventionally handsome character, Blondie, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, is "the Good," and the de facto hero. However, the villain of the film is the hawkish featured "Bad" and not "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">the Ugly</a>," who is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> to boot).
</li><li> Zig-zagged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadTheWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadTheWeird">The Good, the Bad, the Weird</a></em>. Do-won, "The Good", is ridiculously good looking, but so is the "Bad", Chang-yi. However, the "Weird", Tae-goo, who is stout and pudgy, was, at least in his past, arguably the most morally repellent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> plays this straight with all human characters, to the point that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> shows both Palpatine becoming the way he looked in the original trilogy within minutes of the Jedi discovering he's a Sith Lord, and Darth Vader lost his once good looks shortly after turning to the dark side.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, the Good Witches are pretty, and the Wicked Witches are ugly. Glinda says straight up that "Only bad witches are ugly". (And yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">she had to ask</a> if Dorothy was a good or bad witch.)
</li><li> Conversed and played completely straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">sequel</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zenon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zenon">Zenon</a></em>. When the aliens finally show up at the end, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> who travel in a butterfly/manta ray style space ship that shifts between pastel, Easter egg colors of pink, blue, yellow, etc. When a character asks if these aliens might be hostile, Zenon replies, with no irony and a completely straight face, "Nobody could have a ship that beautiful and be evil." She was right; they were good aliens who saved their lives and repaired the space station.
</li><li> At the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable">Unbreakable</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> describes a comic cover in art-critic detail, commenting on the villain's inhumanely big head. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the movie, he reveals to the hero that he was always meant to be the villain because of his brittle bones. "They called me 'Mr. Glass'"</span>
</li><li> This trope is always so much fun to observe whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryOfScotland">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> pop up. If the story is focusing on Mary, she will be rather pretty, whilst Elizabeth will look like an ugly old hag. But if it's Elizabeth in the spotlight, she's always portrayed as having far more grace and beauty, whilst Mary is transformed into a woman whose bitterness is shown quite clearly on her plain (if she's lucky) face. Expect the ugly one to have crows' feet, and any ugly Elizabeth will have hair exactly the wrong shade of red and far too much white makeup on. The irony of this is that both Elizabeth and Mary would have been seen as <em>absolutely freaking gorgeous</em> in our time at age twenty-five - they both resembled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicoleKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicoleKidman">Nicole Kidman</a> in face and in body. Neither of them aged as well, but what can you expect in the 16th century?
</li><li> This comes in three layers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTaleOfDespereaux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTaleOfDespereaux">The Tale of Despereaux</a></em>. The cute mouse and porcelain-skinned princess are good, the plain but not hideous Mig and Rascuro are susceptible to evil urges, and the ugly other rats are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. Although the movie does state that the princess was partly at fault, for being rude to Mig and flat-out screaming at Rascuro when he tries to apologize.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/INowPronounceYouChuckAndLarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/INowPronounceYouChuckAndLarry">I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry</a></em>, anyone who disagrees with gay marriage (or homosexuality in general) is noticeably unattractive. Watch again and you'll see. Characters who are borderline attractive are also on the fence regarding gay rights, and invariably back up the titular couple in the end. Obviously, this isn't so much "good and evil" as it is "backing up our message with visual cues," but still.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliceInWonderland2010">Alice in Wonderland (2010)</a></em> plays this trope straight. The White Queen is gorgeous and Alice is pretty as well, whereas the Red Queen is very strange-looking. But it also seriously subverts it with the Mad Hatter and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Bandersnatch</span>. And also Tweedle-Dee, Tweedle-Dum, and the March Hare. It's also worth pointing out that the Red Queen herself is aware of this trope, telling her sister at one point that she can't get her way for once just by blinking her "pretty eyes".
</li><li> Played straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">film version</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matilda">Matilda</a></em>. All the evil characters are either unattractive or just average, whereas Matilda's heaven-sent teacher Miss Honey is probably the only good looking person in the movie. Not counting the cute little innocent kids, that is. This gets a bit silly when the tackily-made-up, unattractively-voiced Mrs. Wormwood starts lecturing Miss Honey about the merits of books versus looks. That's how it was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">the book</a> as well. If anything, the drawings of Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood were <em>uglier</em> than their live-action counterparts (Mr. Wormwood looked a bit like a rodent and Mrs. Wormwood is described as being plump, with obviously-dyed hair and a "suet-pudding" face).
</li><li> Played very straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SolomonKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SolomonKane">Solomon Kane</a></em>, where Kane in the start is ragged and crazy-looking with his messy beard and hair, and his crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> expressions, but after doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> he smoothes out his facial hair and becomes ruggedly handsome. Likewise, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> recruits warriors, he does some kind of demonic possession-thing where the recruits receive horrible scars, black eyes and bad teeth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">all which go away when they die.</a> Oh, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> himself is horribly scarred under his mask, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFaced">Two-Faced</a> appearance with his tattoos.
</li><li> Played depressingly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPacifistPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPacifistPeople">The</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish">Bak'u</a> look like catalog models, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">the Son'a</a> look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> after 20 too many facelifts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>'s 1968 pro-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> project <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenBerets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenBerets">The Green Berets</a></em> played this straight with a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei">George Takei</a> as a handsome South Vietnamese commander, and his Viet Cong counterpart as anything but.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OzTheGreatAndPowerful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OzTheGreatAndPowerful">Oz the Great and Powerful</a></em>, all three witches appear beautiful at first. Her stunning appearance is what convinces Oz that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Glinda</span> is good, though, given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> character, it's not perhaps astounding that a pretty face turns his head. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thedora's</span> transformation into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> into the Wicked Witch of the West</span> is accompanied by her becoming quite monstrous. And in the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Evanora's beautiful appearance is caused by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">Glamour</a> and she's really an old hag</span>.
</li><li> It's implied that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> serum in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em> horrifically mutates bad men and amplifies the attractiveness in good ones. This would explain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Red Skull</a>'s deformation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Steve</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild">getting more buff</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men Film Series</a></em>: As a consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>, Charles Xavier's good looks are emblematic of his good heart in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">First Class</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenApocalypse">trilogy</a>. Even when his younger self is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em>, he's still an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty">Unkempt Beauty</a>, which means that his heroic side has merely been suppressed, not extinguished.
</li><li> Played straight with Adam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IFrankenstein">I, Frankenstein</a></em>. At first, he's very obviously a creature stitched from different parts, as shown by the stitches on his face. However, throughout the movie, the stitches get less and less noticeable. By the end, he could easily pass for a human with a few scars. It doesn't hurt that he looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronEckhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronEckhart">Aaron Eckhart</a>. This signifies him moving away from being a mindless animal who is only out for himself and finding a purpose in life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and developing a soul</span>. Averted with the gargoyles and the demons. They both look unattractive in their true form, while their human appearances vary.
</li><li> The Autobots in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em> have humanoid appearances so that audiences can identify as them as the good guys. They have humanoid faces and bodies and five-fingered hands, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Jetfire</a>. Also, they always talk in English, even when there are no humans around. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sentinel Prime subverts it.</span> Meanwhile, most Decepticons have animalistic appearances and communicate with animal noises and Cybertronian language, in order to highlight their alien nature.
</li><li> The Kurosawa film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sanjuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sanjuro">Sanjuro</a></em> inverts this with Chamberlain Mutsuta and Superintendent Kikui. The Chamberlain describes himself as having a "horse face", which lead the warriors to mistrust him despite his being an honorable man, while they initially assume that Kikui is a good man who will aid them in dealing with the corrupt officials because he's handsome when he's really their ringleader. Also inverted with a couple of ugly but well-meaning young sidekicks. Played straight with Sanjuro, who is scruffy but very handsome.
</li><li> The Cosmic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> initially played this straight with its alien factions, but started to play around with it later.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, the heroic extraterrestrials (Asgardians) are Human Aliens primarily represented by a tall muscular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hunk">hunk</a> in Thor. The villainous aliens, the Chitauri, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens">Humanoid Aliens</a> with visibly different hand and leg structure and faces that resemble a combination of human skulls and birds.
</li><li> Similar story in <em>Film/Thor</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em>, with the Asgardians being much more attractive than both the Frost Giants and Dark Elves - and, as <em>Ragnarok</em> reveals, the Fire Demons. Even Asgardian buildings and landscapes are beautiful compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor</a> realms that the latter three races live in.
</li><li> Continued in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, where the villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> (Sakaarans) are humanoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens">Insectoid Aliens</a> while the 'good' races seen on Xandar are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> at best (e.g. pink skin and eyes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyEars">Pointy Ears</a>), with many being outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>. The heroes themselves are a human, two to three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> (the only things distinguishing them from humans being green/grey/blue skin and some markings that may or may not be tattoos), a raccoon, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">cute</a> tree-like alien. Though the <em>main</em> villain also resembles an attractive blue-skinned human man. The villain of the sequel is a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingPlanet">Living Planet</a> who can take any form in an avatar, though for most of the film he looks like <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussel">Kurt Russel</a>.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>, the only sign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gamora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gamora">Gamora</a>'s cyborg augmentation is some ridging on her face, which looks as if it might even be her species' natural bone structure. By contrast, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> and former friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NebulaMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NebulaMarvelComics">Nebula</a> has a metal strip across her face including a cybernetic eye and one clearly cybernetic arm. In the sequel, it's explained that Thanos used to make the two of them fight and would order a piece cut off the loser and replaced with cybernetics. Gamora kept winning the fights, so she didn't end up with as many cybernetic parts as Nebula. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also, Nebula makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> after the two of them reconcile.</span>
</li><li> Finally subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel">Captain Marvel</a></em>. The former has noticeably more inhuman aliens such as Korg and Miek being among Thor's allies against Hela and her undead troops (who are Asgardians, albeit rotten desiccated ones in the latter's case), while the latter has two races of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">Rubber-Forehead Aliens</a> as the main factions with the Kree being noticeably more attractive and human-like than the Skrulls. It turns out that the former were more or less playing on this trope as part of a ploy to convince the titular hero that they were the good guys and the Skrulls evil aggressors, when in reality it was the other way around.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in two German live-action adaptations of <em>Frau Holle</em> (in 1977 and 2008): the bad sister is, in fact, a lot prettier than the good one &#150; and because of that, she's not merely lazy and rude but also extremely vain. Then double subverted as these adaptations are also the ones to include a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> for her (combined with washing off the pitch).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> is very rife with this: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Spartans</a> exemplify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GorgeousGreek">Greek beef-cakery</a> with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">heroically buff and muscular builds</a>, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">evil Persians</a> run gamut of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrotesqueGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrotesqueGallery">Grotesque Gallery</a> with several monsters in their army and even the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalHarem">harem girls</a> look bizarre</em>. Interestingly, of the two Spartan traitors, Ephialtes is highly deformed but is the most sympathetic at least compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Theron</a>. The second movie tones this down by presenting the Persians in a more conventional manner and the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">Artemisia</a> being a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">Evil Is Sexy</a>.

<ul><li> Played uncomfortably straight with the Cylons&mdash;the good (or at least sympathetic) Cylons are played by attractive young actors and actresses (Six, Boomer/Athena, D'Anna, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anders, Chief Tyrol</span>), the more morally doubtful (Leoben, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tigh</span>) are older and less conventionally attractive, and the outright evil (Cavil) is the ugliest and oldest of the lot. Then again, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tory</span> is both young and attractive and also morally doubtful, and her actions have resulted in her seeming far less sympathetic. And given D'Anna was willing even in her last (S4) appearance <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to wipe out humanity even after they helped resurrect her</span> she probably deserves to be in the morally doubtful region along with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tory</span>.
</li><li> The (only) perfectly upstanding character, Karl Agathon, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">named after</a> this trope (see "Kalos kai Agathos" above).
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps surprisingly, given its self-awareness, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> often falls victim to this trope. Apart from the Slayers themselves (who are all stunning), all the other major good guy characters are attractive, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> Willow, while the demons are usually hideous. True, there are <em>some</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">good looking villains</a>, (Spike, Angelus, Faith, etc.), but most of these characters were either very minor or ended up performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, or ended up <em>looking</em> really, really monstrous. Glory is the only good-looking seasonal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who was presented entirely without sympathy. (Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">The First</a>, able to look like anyone it wants to as long as it's dead and given to appearing like Buffy, might count.) And, of course, Willow was recast from the pilot to be cuter. The original tends to be known on the Internet as "Fat Willow", with forum posters complaining about how the show would have been ruined...
</li><li> May or may not have been intentional with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed (1998)</a></em>. Piper, Phoebe, Paige, and Prue are all gorgeous women. Their enemies in the first season were commonly monstrous-looking, and when they began to look like ordinary humans, they were usually greasy and dirty looking, as if they'd been living in a cave. Although quite subverted with the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Zankou</a>, who is implied to have had a relationship with the stunning Seer, Kyra.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> None of the Doctors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> were victims of savage beatings with the ugly stick (or at least not for long), but most of them are or were unconventionally handsome. Most subversive is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> (the Fourth Doctor), who was not what you'd call the most traditionally handsome of men, yet was easily the most popular and well-recognised of the Doctors in the classic series (though that second is partly longevity). The <em>companions</em>, however, are almost invariably traditionally beautiful, with their beauty often being the main indication that the Doctor is going to pick them up.
</li><li> The more conventionally handsome Doctors tend to be the more "human" in outlook, tending to form strong emotional attachments with humans and converse with them on their level. The odder-looking ones tend towards being more prickly or more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">psychologically alien</a>. The Fourth Doctor, played by a forty-something actor with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBlueEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBlueEyes">eyes that literally stick out</a>, wild hair and a huge nose, had what <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipHinchcliffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipHinchcliffe">Philip Hinchcliffe</a> called "Olympian detachment" and tended to avoid committed relationships even with companions; the Eleventh Doctor, a handsome twenty-something, was what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> called "a boyfriend-type Doctor" and had a whole arc about his marriage.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor even lampshades this trope and his odd appearance when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowingOffTheNewBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowingOffTheNewBody">pulling faces at himself in the mirror after his new regeneration</a> &mdash; "can't say much about the physiognomy".
</li><li> Played with by the Sixth Doctor, who (at the beginning of his tenure, anyway) is probably the most conventionally attractive of the classic Doctors, and is initially alarmed, then pleased by how good-looking he suddenly is, doing a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowingOffTheNewBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowingOffTheNewBody">Showing Off the New Body</a>. Unfortunately, he's also a tasteless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> egomaniac and one of the most bastardly of all the Doctors thus far, especially in contrast to his incredibly sweet and human previous self. As he gets nicer, he gains weight, ages and gets worse hair.
</li><li> The Eleventh Doctor also plays with this. He has an unusual sort of face that looks extremely handsome from certain angles, and extremely ugly with other ones &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> said he looks like "a caricature of a handsome man". The camera crew exploit this, making him look handsome when he's being noble and kind, and ugly when he's being frightening and weird.
</li><li> <strong>Really</strong> played with when it comes to the Twelfth Doctor, whose actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> was the second-oldest of the numbered Doctors when cast. He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyGood">Creepy Good</a> to the core, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeanAndMean">Lean and Mean</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows">Big Ol' Eyebrows</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glares</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero">Pragmatic Hero</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> who alienates his companion Clara &mdash; she knew Eleven well (and also met Ten and the War Doctor) and knows he needs her still as Twelve, but almost leaves him for good during his first season after a well-intentioned act of his comes off as cruel and condescending. Twelve is <strong>also</strong> a less boastful man who wants to be more virtuous than his previous selves were, and capable of incredible empathy, compassion, and forgiveness. His look softens as time passes, and while he is often grumpy and always a dangerous man to cross (the final stretch of Series 9 has him temporarily become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> drives him mad), he also has a tender, poetic soul. When he encounters his time-hopping wife River Song post-Series 9, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes the "sweetie" she pined for, the lover that Eleven never could bring himself to be, ultimately staying with her for twenty-four years</span>.
</li><li> The Doctor and the Master go back and forth on this one. It does often depend on the viewers&#146; opinion of each actor&#146;s attractiveness because neither (with the exception of the Crispy Master) is ever outright horrible-looking, but there is still often a general consensus one way or the other.
<ul><li> The Third Doctor and the Delgado Master invert it. While both are reasonably attractive and sophisticated older men, the Delgado Master is far more smooth and charming than the Third Doctor, who by comparison can often be awkward and off-putting to the people around him. This is best seen in &#147;The Time Monster&#148; serial, in which the Master easily charms a woman into falling in love with him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">(only to use her for his plans, of course)</a>. Meanwhile this incarnation of the Doctor never wooed anyone, always coming across as a more grandfatherly figure instead.
</li><li> The Fourth Doctor and the Crispy Master play this trope VERY straight. Although the Doctor is in one of his more awkward-looking incarnations, he is nowhere near the rotting corpse abomination that the Master has become in this form.
</li><li> The Tremas Master inverts it with every Doctor he encounters. While not to the same degree, he does still capture much of the Delgado Master&#146;s &#147;suave older gentleman&#148; charm against multiple goofy-looking and awkward Doctors (Four and Seven in particular). The Fifth and Sixth Doctors, while more conventionally attractive, still play into this inversion for being less charming than he is. Additionally playing into this inversion is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">The Rani</a> gets thrown in as a third-party to their rivalry, and when she does, she outdoes even the Master in terms of both good looks and evil, further inverting this trope.
</li><li> The Eighth Doctor and Bruce Master play it straight again. The Eighth Doctor is one of the most conventionally handsome incarnations of all, against a snake-eyed, acid-spitting, decaying (albeit nowhere near as badly as the Fourth Doctor&#146;s opponent) version of the Master who has terrible dress sense to boot.
</li><li> The Tenth Doctor plays it straight against the Yana Master, mostly due to their extreme age gap, but once the Yana Master regenerates into the much younger Saxon Master, they are more or less completely even in both charm and looks in general.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor and Missy Master invert it again, where both are older than their predecessors but Missy is FAR more charming and approachable than he is, and noticeably younger too. While Missy&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCheekbones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCheekbones">Villainous Cheekbones</a> might have otherwise been a hint that she&#146;s the evil one between the two, the Twelfth Doctor&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlEyebrows">Big Ol' Eyebrows</a> and stern face cancel this out. Then the Saxon Master comes back during this time and inverts it with him as well for similar reasons.
</li><li> The Thirteenth Doctor and O Master play it straight again, although only very slightly. Both are very young and attractive and charming, but the difference is that this version of the Master has such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> that he loses his charm extremely easily. Working in the Doctor&#146;s favor as well is that she is the closest the Doctor has ever been to outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a>, with a cuteness level that only the Eighth and Tenth Doctors have come close to.
</li></ul></li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens">monsters</a>" are generally unattractive by human standards, but it's often subverted with the revelation that they're not really that monstrous. <em>Some</em> of them are capital-E-Evil, but some have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, some of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a>, and some of them are actually the good guys.
</li><li> Played straight in the first Dalek serial, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks">"The Daleks"</a>. The two races on Skaro are the Daleks, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenManInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenManInACan">Little Green Man in a Can</a> species with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboSpeak">Robo Speak</a> voices whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">mutated form is never shown aside from the reactions of the people who see it</a>, and the Thals, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace">Inhumanly Beautiful Race</a> who are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleOfHairColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleOfHairColor">blond-haired</a> and tall. While the Thals initially attempt to give medicine to the crew and the Daleks imprison them out of paranoia, it's notable that the Daleks aren't really all that bad in their first story, as the viewer is assumed to want to side with the beautiful Thals over them on sight. The Daleks also soon got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">full-on space-racists</a> with no sympathetic qualities at all. When <em>Doctor Who</em>'s writing improved and the Thals-versus-Daleks dynamic became the relic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks">"Genesis of the Daleks"</a> showed the Daleks as the genetically brain-damaged followers of an evil mad scientist, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> the Thals' supposed pacifism and their patriarchal, beauty-fetishising culture, showing them mistreating Sarah Jane because of her sex and putting anyone visibly deformed from chemical weapons as a subhuman slave caste.
</li><li> Zigzagged in the William Hartnell-era story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E3TheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E3TheRescue">"The Rescue"</a>. The TARDIS lands, Barbara and Ian go out to investigate, and an insect-like, googly-eyed monster, named Coquillion, attacks Barbara. When Ian returns to the Doctor, the Doctor reveals he's been on this planet before, and the natives are a very nice species who live in isolated, egalitarian and cooperative social groups of about a hundred and have nothing to gain from becoming violent, and refuses to accept the terrifying appearance Ian claims Coquillion had as evidence he would ever kill anyone. However, the Doctor and Ian get trapped in a cave with a different, lizardlike monster while investigating, and assume it's going to eat them. Later, Barbara (who survived) shoots the monster from the cave because she thinks it was attacking an orphaned human girl, but it turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">it was a herbivorous creature that she treated like a pet</a>. At the end of the story, however, the Doctor corners Coquillion and reveals that what we assumed was his face was actually ceremonial dress used in his people's religious rituals, being worn by a human man who claims to have committed genocide against the natives of the planet. The man is then attacked by two natives who survived his genocide, and we see that they are actually beautiful blond men similar to Thals.
<ul><li> Even so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E1Galaxy4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E1Galaxy4">"Galaxy 4"</a> still partially plays it straight &mdash; the first indication that the Chumblies aren't as hostile as they appear is that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMachines">super cute</a>, with Vicki remarking on it.

Grades and academics are much more important to chubby Josh than handsome Drake, who knows how to play the guitar but generally doesn't take anything else too seriously. (As Josh says to him once after Drake fails to get his drivers license despite getting along very well with the female instructor, "You can't just coast through life on good looks, charm, and cool. Okay, you can. But it's not going to get you everything.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> has this in spades, although it's often subverted in later seasons. Rygel, arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero">least heroic</a> member of the crew, looks like a cross between a miniature Jabba the Hutt, a moth (look at those eyebrows), and a melting frog. Scorpius, who served as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> between seasons 2-4, is a dead ringer for a desiccated corpse in a gimp suit. And let's not forget Furlow, the filthy and, er, "solid" mechanic who betrays the Moya crew at every available opportunity, eventually even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leaving John Crichton to die a painful and irradiated death. Thankfully, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackupTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackupTwin">a spare</a></span>.
<ul><li> As mentioned above, this trope becomes less egregious as time goes on, and is downright subverted by Season 5, with the introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">Commandant Grayza</a> as the new antagonist and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Scorpius' ascent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> status</span>.

<ul><li> Many characters admired or trusted for their beauty&#151;such as Cersei, Joffrey, and Margaery&#151;are actually villainous, cruel, or manipulative while more honorable and compassionate characters like Tyrion and Brienne are mocked or despised for their unattractiveness.
</li><li> Other characters play it straight.

<ul><li> The assertion that 'beautiful is better' is very prominent in <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek/Roman Mythology</a></strong>. Most gods and goddesses are described as possessing a beauty so transcendently beautiful that they can't even be looked upon with mortal eyes. Hephaestus &mdash; god of blacksmiths, craftsmen, and artisans &mdash; was said to have been thrown from Mt. Olympus because his mother, Hera, was ashamed of having an ugly child. Most of Zeus&#146;s and Apollo&#146;s philandering was often caused by them falling head over heels at the first attractive person that they saw. In fact, the famous Trojan War was set off both because Paris thought that having the most beautiful woman from the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, was a better option than being freakin' king of half of the world or genius of warfare offered by Hera and Athena. In the Classical view, beauty isn't just in the eye of the beholder, it's an objective reality that even divinity doesn't ignore.
</li><li> There is a sect of Hinduism that believes that if a woman is not beautiful, she did something very bad in a past life and the gods are punishing her.
</li><li> To Catholics and Orthodox Christians, the Virgin Mary is said to be the very essence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady">the perfect woman</a>, and accordingly, is always described as being <em>extraordinarily</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman">beautiful</a>, on the grounds that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">predestined to be</a> the Mother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> and so was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">perfect</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineRaceLift">Moreover, the exact description changes depending on the culture of the describer, always conforming 100% (or more) to whatever the ideal of feminine beauty happens to be in that time and place</a>. Interestingly, her looks are not even so much as mentioned in passing, at any of her (very few) appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">The Four Gospels</a></em>. Many Christian denominations also believe human souls will be reunited with their bodies on Judgment Day, and their bodies will be transformed. The righteous will receive beautiful, glorified bodies that resemble extremely idealized versions of themselves, while the wicked will be placed in twisted, pain wracked versions of their old bodies.

She is a goddess of love and beauty, and earlier editions had game mechanic rules stating that her clergy had to satisfy a minimum level of physical attractiveness (as measured by the charisma stat) in order to serve. The goddess herself requires her servants to promote beauty and love even among the ugly: the vanity and prejudice is chiefly the result of her clergy's collective fear that ugly or even average-looking priests or priestesses would 'sully' the church's reputation. Clerics who weren't part of the church structure would receive answers to their pleas regardless of their physical appearance, but the organized church wouldn't welcome them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem">Hero System</a></em> games, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em>, postulate that the average man on the street has stats of 8 in all categories, including physical appearance. Player Character, on the other hand, get a 10 in each category because they are the heroes. So your "average hero" is notably better looking than a regular schmoe. The stat that reflects your good looks is also by far the easiest one to buy up, so most heroes end up having supermodel good looks because there is very little downside to it.
<ul><li> This has changed in 6th Edition, which removes the Comeliness stat altogether. Instead, Players who want a character who looks significantly outside the norm can purchase Striking Looks, which can add to certain social skill rolls and abilities. Notably, Striking Looks includes not just unreal beauty, but unreal ugliness, a truly alien appearance, and just about any other kind of appearance, all with similar effects on mechanics (though different kinds of SL will apply in different circumstances).

The Evil Wizard from the Castle sets has the same face as Ogel, so that's another one. The Bulls of Knight's Kingdom have are scarred, clad in rusted armour, and have silver eyes. Things get far worse, of course, if you consider the Pirates to be bad guys, what with the hooks, peglegs, eyepatches, and scars. To give LEGO some credit, they have had scarred or deformed heroes, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidMiners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidMiners">Rock Raider's</a> Chief (prosthetic arm), Power Miner's Rex (facial scarring), Dino Attack's Viper (more facial scarring), and Lego Island's Captain Click (a pirate skeleton). Still, ugly villains greatly outnumber even unattractive (if they were real) heroes.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> does an almost facepalmingly straight adherence to this rule. Almost all the good guys will be bishonen, ruggedly handsome men, hot chicks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guys</a> (sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox">good looking for their age</a>, too) and most of the bosses will be <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Heintz">old<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Glass_(character)">plain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Gheb">gonks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. They'll attempt to mix things by always adding <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Gonzalez">one or two gonks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and a <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Makalov">non hottie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to the good guys side, and typically the bad guys will have one or two good looking guys on their side, however they'll usually be either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">good at heart</a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Narcian">wear an unflattering facial expression on their portrait<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Sometimes a few of the ugly minor bosses will hint or be revealed to not have been bad at heart after their death. The simplest way to put it is ugly characters are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a> for the good guys and attractive characters are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a> for the bad guys. Ugly good guys far outnumber attractive bad guys, seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">Evil Is Sexy</a> is not one of Intelligent Systems' favorite tropes. This can sometimes make sense (Most of the early foes are low class bandits, the latter ones are old nobles are in some games a separate species, while most player characters are nobility or young), but often doesn't.
<ul><li> This trope is very much enforced when it comes to female bad guys, no exceptions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">Expect any good looking female villain who is well-aged, or young and beautiful to be an anti-villain.</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Brunnya">Yes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Ursula">any<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Selena_(The_Sacred_Stones)">cute<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://fireemblemwiki.org/wiki/Aversa">woman<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. All of the female villains to be unsympathetic are either poorly aged with wrinkles or wear a very unflattering expression with evil-looking eyes.
</li><li> If you're a sympathetic character in <em>Fire Emblem</em>, you're either at least quite attractive, or you're old. And if you fall into the latter category, you were likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasQuiteALooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasQuiteALooker">quite a looker when you were younger</a>. There are only a few major exceptions to this (i.e. most axe-users).
</li><li> This can get particularly funny in the first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>, where you <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/fdEtPKl.png">get a look at the princes of Verdane<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. Three guesses which one is playable.
</li><li> It would be easier to list out the exceptions of this trope, many of which are in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">The Binding Blade</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.feplanet.net/media/gallery/view.php?id=241">Dorothy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>'s main trait is being plain-looking compared to the rest of the army. Gonzales and Garret are reformed bandits who look like they could be early-game bandit bosses, yet join your army all the same. And <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/f/f7/Niime_%28Artwork%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20160614032743">Niime<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is perhaps the only elderly woman playable in the entire series. Fighters also tend to be less pretty, but in a more <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/f/fa/Bartre.png/revision/latest?cb=20151014150231">dumpy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/1/13/LotArt.png/revision/latest?cb=20160613164054">plain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> sense than an outright ugly sense.
</li><li> A major and famous exception is Oliver, from the Tellius games. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a></em>, he's a regular boss who has to be disposed of (and there's a good chance that an ally character kill him for you), and he's an insufferable narcissist, viewing himself as the epitome of beauty... Despite the fact that he <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/f/f8/OliverFE9Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20090516082642">looks like this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. He makes his return in <em>Radiant Dawn</em> where, against all odds, despite being once again the boss of a chapter, he <em>is</em> recruitable. Except that, well, he hasn't changed much (if at all) between the two games: he's still the same vain, self-absorbed character, who only joins you as a protector of beauty (he's quite fond of herons). Though they decided to make him <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/0/0b/OliverFE10Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20090516082710">less evil-looking<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, he's still the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a>. Heck, even Ike begs him to return on the enemy side.

</li><li> Interestingly, due to the Capture mechanics of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, while this trend is still in play with a number of villains, this can be subverted with a number of Gonk-ish or not-conventionally attractive villains, who can be convinced to join your side. Of course, since they aren't plot important, you can off them anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting">Art of Fighting</a></em>, King was a villain with a more masculine build and a homely face (presumably to help hide the twist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">her being a woman</a>). After making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> in the sequel (complete with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> establishing that she had actually been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> during the first game), she was given a slimmer frame and more conventionally attractive facial features. From then on, all of her appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> series and the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcom">intercompany crossovers</a> have depicted her as a gorgeous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a>.
</li><li> Reversed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwoWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwoWorlds">Two Worlds II</a></em>: at one point, the protagonist is begged by the helpful leader of a nearly-doomed colony to hunt down the reason of their misery - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an evil witch, who not only lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwampsAreEvil">deep in a swamp</a> but who is indeed hideous</span>. However, instead of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing the witch, the protagonist can also listen to her unexpected pleas</span>. Doing so opens an entirely new subplot, which eventually reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the real Evil Force was actually the charismatic leader, while the witch was the true protector of the people</span>. The reversal is <em>then</em> reversed in the end of that subplot, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the witch's beauty is magically restored upon the demise of the real villain</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em>: Played straight. Another layer is added on with the impossibly beautiful and pacifistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elves</a> and the horrific designs for the monsters, who are bloodthirsty and primitive. These other creatures are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">rarely seen</a>, however. And really, what's more beautiful than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">a baby</a></span>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> generally averts this, although sometimes small bits get through.
<ul><li> In the <em>Classic</em>, the Alliance had all the pretty races while the Horde had the ugly ones. However, the Horde was not evil, merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savage</a> in a morally gray fight over the land to live on. <em>Burning Crusade</em> further muddied the trope by giving them the pretty Blood Elves.
</li><li> A little shade of it was in the Draenei and their changes over the years. Originally, they were an ugly race with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily">More Teeth than the Osmond Family</a> and raptorish feet, which nevertheless were allied with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> Illidan and opposed the demonic Eredar (who had typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">Horny Devils</a> appearance.) In the <em>Burning Crusade</em> they were retconned to being a fallen and mutated Draenei - and we were introduced to the proper, clean and pretty Draenei as a playable race, directly allied with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">the Naaru</a>. The previous Draenei, now called Lost Ones, were portrayed almost exclusively as insane villains. The newly introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Ugly Cute</a> Broken were also made antagonists, but it was due to being enslaved by Illidan gone mad, not being inherently evil. Furthermore, the trope was averted with the Eredar, who were shown to be Draenei that fully embraced the demon powers - they look just like Draenei, only red instead of blue.
</li><li> The expansion &#145;&#146;Mists Of Pandaria&#146;&#146; brought back two NPCs from previous expansions, an ugly orc, Bloodhilt, and Marshall Twinbraid, a handsome dwarf. The previous depictions of the characters gave them personalities opposite their appearance, with Bloodhilt being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">gruff but honorable</a> commander interested in protecting his allies, whilst Twinbraid was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> who killed the native people for peacefully protesting against his pillaging of the land. However &#145;&#146;Mists Of Pandaria&#146;&#146; completely overhauled their characterization in adherence to this and traditional high fantasy tropes such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a>. The ugly Bloodhilt became a one dimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Evil</a> bad guy who wanted to oppress the pandaren and was wrongly blamed by the writers for crimes he never did. Whilst Twinbraid was treated as a hero trying to protect the Pandaren from the evil of the Horde.
</li></ul></li><li> The only nice demon bound in Jerro's Haven in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> is also the one who goes around disguised as an Eladrin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>, if the player character goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>, s/he develops pale whitish skin and yellowed eyes.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, Saren, the apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game, is clearly weird-looking by Turian standards, sporting glowing blue eyes and cybernetic implants on top of the spikey Turian exoskeleton. On the other hand, Benezia is much more attractive but still acts as Saren's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> for much of the game. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's revealed that both of them have been brainwashed by Sovereign, and both of them get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAsYourself">Dying as Yourself</a> ending (optional in Saren's case). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Sovereign</a> himself is a giant insectoid spaceship and makes use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> behavior</span>.
<ul><li> In the second game, quite a few of the villains are even more monstrous: the Collectors, for example, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsectoidAliens">Insectoid Aliens</a> equipped with a lot of repulsive-looking organic technology, and serve the Reapers in abducting human colonists for use in their experiments. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Once again, it's revealed that the Collectors are just brainwashed servants of the Reapers; before they were enslaved, the Collectors were the equally bizarre-looking Protheans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentPrecursors">Benevolent Precursors</a> to the current galactic civilization.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, picking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Renegade</a> choices will make Commander Shepard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">post-resurrection</a> scars appear wider and glow red (a rather disturbing picture <a class="urllink" href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Morality#Renegade_2">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).

To go even further, in social psychology there exists such a thing as "self-fulfilling prophecy" which further cements the "halo effect". Those who are treated as good or bad people (even if only on the basis of their appearance) will be prone to behave accordingly.

Kennedy</a> had won the debate, while those who listened on the radio thought the sweaty, uncomfortable-looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> had won. Of course, TV being a relatively emergent technology that was only just starting to be adopted at the time could have resulted in differences in the demographics of television owners and non-television owners. And, of course, while it might be a poor reason to not vote for someone because they look like a slightly-crazed, paranoid, crook, the fact that Nixon, in fact, turned out to be a slightly-crazed, paranoid, crook is of no little relevance.
<ul><li> Even more interesting: While Kennedy was the president who brought the US military into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> full-force (before then, we were supplying troops but it was not an official war), the less-attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> has tended to receive the lion's share of the blame for the conflict. Nixon was the one who eventually pulled us out, but this is rarely mentioned, mainly due to (a) his "tough talk" rhetoric that made this <em>seem</em> unlikely (even though it was actually key to executing the policy at all), (b) his initial escalation of the fighting, and (c) did we mention that this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>?
<ul><li> Although here a number of other factors are at least as important, if not more so. John F. Kennedy's image was retroactively enhanced by his assassination, which conveyed a kind of secular sainthood on him and made a lot of people forget how controversial he had been in life, and also by the fact that there weren't many news stories involving Vietnam during his administration. Johnson, in contrast, had to deal with bad news from Vietnam throughout his two terms. And while Nixon got the US Army out of Vietnam, the way that happened was perceived as a humiliating defeat, with the images of the hurried evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Saigon sticking in the public conscious for decades to come.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During the Victorian era, this concept was widely held to be true; a person's physical appearance was a reflection on their morality and social standing. The introduction discusses 19th Century quackery discourses of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">Phrenology<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy">Physiognomy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as an attempt to quantify and qualify these dubious claims. While the latter discipline was not unique to the 19th Century, its influence and popularity reached a zenith during the Georgian, Regency, and especially, Victorian eras. This wasn't surprising since one's wealth typically coincided with the degree of their access to proper necessities which made beauty even <em>possible;</em> as a result, today's "average" was yesterday's "god-like."
</li><li> In Spanish, "to be" can be translated as two different verbs (<em>ser</em> and <em>estar</em>) "ser buena" (to be good) means to be a good/nice person, and "estar buena" (literally translated also: "to be good") means being physically attractive (although usually "hot" more than "beautiful"). This might be because <em>ser</em> means "to be a certain way inherently" whereas <em>estar</em> draws its distinction in definition from meaning something more like "to be a certain way at a specific time." In other words, "ser buena" most means "to be good inherently," whereas the most literal translation for "estar buena" could be "to be good for the moment" and not necessarily as a regular thing. This suggests that Spanish-speaking cultures are probably at least somewhat aware of beauty's tendency to be fleeting and superficial, and have therefore linked it to temporary and superficial goodness in their language. The connection&mdash;however tenuous&mdash;between being physically attractive and being morally upright is still there, however.
<ul><li> That whole mess can technically be avoided with other adjectives (bonito/a, hermoso/a, guapo/a, etc.). In these cases one can say, for example, <em>ser bonita</em> (to be naturally pretty) or <em>estar bonita</em> (to be pretty at the moment, by dressing up for example).
</li></ul></li><li> In French, one way of saying "she's hot" is "elle est bonne", which also translates as "she's good". Strangely, this expression is not used in the masculine form.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">ancient Greeks</a> took this very, <em>very</em> seriously. <em>Kaloi k'agathoi</em> ("the Beautiful and the Good") was what Greek aristocrats called themselves. To be beautiful was considered a gift from the gods and was a sign of their favor. This allowed good-looking Greeks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImBeautiful">get away with things just because they were beautiful</a>, and occasionally hurt ugly people when accused of a crime. For instance:
<ul><li> Phryne, an Athenian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl">courtesan</a> known for her beauty, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phryne">was once accused of a form of blasphemy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. At trial, her defense consisted, at least in part, of stripping off her clothes and saying to the (all-male) jury: "Would you dare destroy <em>this</em>?" She was acquitted&mdash;which, to be fair, wasn't <em>purely</em> lust on the part of the jury; again, exceptional beauty was seen as a sign of divine favour. Therefore, at least some of the jurors may have feared that by executing the exceedingly beautiful Phryne, they would risk the wrath of the gods, or one in particular (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess">Aphrodite</a>),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note304t2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note304t2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note304t2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One of the accounts refers to her as a "priestess of Aphrodite", which may or may not have been a euphemism for prostitute, but which certainly reflects how a Greek of her era would have seen someone so beautiful.</span> or at least figured that one so favoured by the gods was incapable of committing blasphemy. The Athenians later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">passed a law</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">that from now on</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">judges are not to look at the defendants</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a>, on the other hand, was famously ugly (both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a> make quite a few "ugly guy" jokes at Socrates' expense). This may have figured into the decision to convict Socrates at trial (the decision to execute him, on the other hand, was more or less because of what he said).
</li></ul></li><li> Public opinion in any trial by media scenario will often fall in line with this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome">Missing White Woman Syndrome</a> (always pretty, young girls) is an obvious real-life relation, and people often have harsher reactions to unusual-looking suspects (as opposed to attractive serial killers mentioned below, who often get fanmail or marriage proposals). Even non-criminal media scandals get this reaction. Take, for example, public perception of the British Royal Family. Princess Diana is lovingly remembered, despite having affairs as her former husband did, while Prince Charles is unpopular and Lady Camilla is largely hated, and both are mocked for their appearance.
</li><li> According to an actual scientific subject on the topic, beautiful criminals usually get more lenient sentences than their ugly counterparts, regardless of the severity of their crime, but when the crime in question is fraud, the tables are turned: attractive frauds almost consistently get the longest convictions. Psychologists believe that this is due to the fact that people find themselves betrayed when this trope isn't played straight, and react far more severely. A beautiful thief or murderer can be explained as a victim of the circumstances, but a beautiful fraud explicitly uses their appearance to deceive and mislead people, and they just can't forgive that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft">William Howard Taft</a> was the last president elected before photographs became a standard feature of newspapers (somewhat obviously).
</li><li> The opposite assumption&mdash;Ugliness Equals Evil&mdash;is exhibited in the various meanings of the Arabic word <em>qab&#299;&#7717;</em>. Its most common meaning is simply "ugly," but it can also mean "disgusting" or "monstrous" or, well, "evil" (as an adjective). However, the more usual word for "evil" is <em>shirr&#299;r</em>, and the other meanings of <em>qab&#299;&#7717;</em> only occur to the educated, so it's not played <em>entirely</em> straight (except in the Maghreb, where it is the colloquial word for "bad"&mdash;not "evil," but "bad"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4fqau');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4fqau" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4fqau');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">i.e., in Morocco, if the new microwave or computer or car you just bought turned out to be hot garbage, it was <em>qab&#299;&#7717;</em>. It's actually close to the British usage of "pants" as an adjective.</span>).
</li><li> This could be one of the principles behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">Double Standard: Rape, Female on Male</a> since the cultural standard for "female" is "beautiful." You can see this in action when it comes to things like child molestation and statutory rape. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeacherStudentRomance">Mary Kay Letourneau does her 12-year-old student?</a> Have you <em>seen</em> what Mary Kay Letourneau looks like?

Kerrigan still looks youthful and gorgeous, while Harding (who, as anyone who was alive during the 1990s remembers, conspired with her ex-husband and bodyguard to break her rival Kerrigan's leg to render her incapable of competing in the Olympics), looks a bit like the mother from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFighter">The Fighter</a></em> after a few <em>more</em> years' hard living.
</li><li> Unfortunately, it's for this reason that animals people consider cute or charismatic get better protection than creepier or menacing looking ones. It's the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">What Measure Is a Non-Cute?</a> exists. This trope can be disastrous for the ecosystem, and it's the reason the concept of a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_species">"Umbrella species"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was invented. Can't get people to care about that rare and useful spider species? Get the habitat of a more popular animal that lives in the same area protected, and now the spider is taken care of too.
</li><li> All visual propaganda uses this. Showing how evil your opponents are would take up too much space on the poster &mdash; more or less subtle differences in beauty are used instead.
<ul><li> Nazi propaganda continuously portrayed the regime's enemies as shrunken, deformed subhumans, and eulogised the handsome, dashing, blond-haired blue-eyed Aryan hero. The regime itself was obsessed with its image. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> himself had adoring fangirls.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> Light Yagami is popular, impeccably groomed and dressed, has girls fawning over him everywhere.

<ul><li> However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this is played straight with Light when he loses his memories of the Death Note for a brief period of time. He is a really great guy, the complete opposite of Kira, and he is still gorgeous</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In contrast, L, the detective chasing Kira, is gangly, funny-looking, and has permanent bags under his eyes; most girls in-story won't even look at him twice, and he has no friends. But he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective">the world's greatest detective</a>, with a strong determination to take down the murderer, albeit using somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">questionable methods</a>. He's often considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Ugly Cute</a>, granted, but this was unintentional.
</li><li> Misa Amane is a supermodel who turns into a serial killer, though she thinks she's doing it for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">good reason</a>; she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">genuinely kind and friendly</a> aside from her actions as the second Kira.
</li><li> Ryuk, the Shinigami, plays this trope relatively straight: he looks like a monster, and he's a nut who doesn't care who lives or dies as long as he's entertained, and he uses humans as playthings. He'd be another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> if he weren't so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">lazy</a>.
</li><li> Shinigami Rem still looks somewhat scary, but she's softer and more feminine than Ryuk, and she does what she does out of a sense of duty to a fallen friend, along with genuine compassion for Misa <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>.
</li><li> Then there's Sidoh, who's ugly as normal for a Shinigami, but isn't so much evil as pathetic and pitifully stupid.
</li><li> Virtually all of the common criminals are butt-ugly. I guess breaking the law only makes you ugly if you do it without the help of a Shinigami.
</li><li> Then there's Mello and Near, where this trope is REALLY played around with. On the one hand, Near is like L in that he is an anti-heroic antagonist who uses questionable methods, yet he looks like a cute little boy. Meanwhile, Mello is an extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a> who commits some pretty appalling crimes just so he can beat Near in catching Kira, yet he is a pretty handsome guy to start with.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em> subverts this beautifully. Deitrich is described as having "the face of an angel and the heart of a devil". Despite his beautiful appearance, he's evil. In addition, during the final battle in the anime Cain's ultimate form resembles a heavenly angel, while Abel's ultimate form resembles a demon from hell
</li><li> Interesting case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em>. Katejima Loos is portrayed as a beautiful girl in her late teens. The series protagonist, Uso, certainly thinks so, since he has a crush on her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She starts out as one of the main heroic cast, but slowly shows her true colors of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bitch</a>. Even when it's clear that she's far from good, Uso refuses to believe that she's evil, even when she tries to kill him on multiple occasions. This changes near the end of the series, when he finally wakes up and fights her back. She even points this out, afterwards, acting shocked that her charms no longer work.</span>
</li><li> The main character's best friend in the light novel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostHunt">Ghost Hunt</a></em> gets hit <em>hard</em> with this trope. Shibuya Kazuya is stunningly beautiful, even after a rough night with next to no sleep at all. Naturally, Mai and her two best friends form instant crushes ... until Mai realises that he's abrasive, cocky, sarcastic, narcissistic and flat-out insulting to just about everyone. What's Michiru's response when she's informed of this? "But ... he's really handsome." Because someone that pretty cannot <em>possibly</em> be a bad person ... Further subverted in that he genuinely does care for his colleagues and clients, and always acts only in the interest of their safety - he just doesn't like to show it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>, most of the noble characters are portrayed as very beautiful. They're generally divided between being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a> (for example, Kail and his brothers) and those who are incompetent or outright harmful to the wellbeing of their countries (for example, Nakia and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nefertiti</span>). The very handsome Ramses wants to gain power in Egypt so he can better care for its people which is a noble goal, but he also repeatedly tries to kidnap and rape Yuri, leading her to consider him a complete cad. Meanwhile, Nakia and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Urhi</span> are <em>very</em> beautiful but also are incredibly and unbelievably evil. Even worse, their backstories show that their beauty caused the circumstances that lead to them becoming as horrible as they are. Yuri, meanwhile, is very cute by modern-day standards but is initially considered plain by most people in Hattusa, mainly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">she's short and flat-chested</a>. As people begin to love her for her kindness and the good things she does for them, they talk about features that they do consider beautiful about her (namely her pale skin and black hair) and her maids imply that her beauty comes from her happy, friendly demeanor.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em>. For the most part, the heroes or ambiguous anti-heroes are mostly good-looking. But certain villains like Jamil, Judar and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gyokuen Ren and other Al-Thamen members like Dunya and Ithan</span> are just as attractive, though they can occasionally lapse into twisted, dark caricatures.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Superior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Superior">Superior</a></em>. Though all the main cast is attractive, 'beauty' is talked about mostly as an internal quality, related to goodness and valuing life. At one point, Sheila breaks down in tears and asks Copy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">who physically looks almost identical to her</a>) and Shadow why they are so ugly after their callous slaughter of a village- while also remembering how <em>she</em> used to be the same way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The original Demon Lord</span>, on the other hand, seems to believe that beauty is in fact related to purity... though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his</span> idea of 'pure' is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood">far, far removed</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">valuing life.</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BetaRayBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BetaRayBill">Beta Ray Bill</a>. He looks like an orange humanoid crocodile/horse hybrid and is even considered hideous by his own people's standards (they normally just look like yellow humanoids with no hair or pupils), yet he is one of the noblest beings in the Marvel Universe. One of the most badass, too. After all, he was the <em>first</em> non-Asgardian to be deemed worthy enough to wield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a>'s hammer, Mjolnir, which was of course intended to be a shock to both Thor and readers.

Five-foot-nothing, slightly hunched, enough hair on his body to wonder why he didn't wind up with the "Beast" codename, and reportedly, poor personal hygiene (even though <em>you know as well as I do he couldn't maintain hair like that without being half-metrosexual</em>). However, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a>, many writers sometimes forget the above description and turn him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuetifulAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuetifulAllAlong">sexy funtastic lady-lovin' machine</a>. Maybe it's animal magnetism, or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">fan-favoritism (the current writers were fans in their youth)</a>, or they realize that one word has always defined Wolvie: stamina.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a>, in her identity as May Parker, started out as a star basketball player with short hair, a major subversion from just about all the mainstream superheroines who've ever gotten their own series. Since that time, while May has grown her hair a little longer, what little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> exists is rather mild, if not non-existent, compared to what many readers have come to expect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em> was started when the creator, Mike Mignola, wanted a hero that looked like a villain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist">Hence, Hellboy looks like a demon.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em> has the actual Prince Charming as a major character and also a shallow, heartless, bastard. Goldilocks is very attractive and turns out to be murderously violent. Bluebeard is, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard">Bluebeard</a>. Beauty is beautiful but happens to be a total bitch. Bigby's looks are up for debate but his actions support him being a subversion whether you think he's good looking or not.
</li><li> Of course, played with often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, thanks to the series blurring the lines between ugliness and beauty, and heroism and villainy.
<ul><li> Rorschach, despite being one of the main heroes (and most certainly the star of the book), is ugly as sin. Uneven haircut (and ginger at that), short, pug nose, spotty face, dead eyes, aged face, he's described as being "fascinatingly ugly" by his psychiatrist. Hasn't stopped a small portion of the female fanbase being into him...
</li><li> Ozymandias. Tall, muscular, blonde, handsome, older than he looks, strong features. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The "villain" of the series</span>.
<ul><li> Of course, these two examples could either be considered an aversion or playing it straight, depending on your point of view.
</li></ul></li><li> Played the straightest with Nite Owl II, who is a little hefty and wears thick glasses but is considered very handsome by at least two characters.
</li><li> Silk Spectre II is rather stunning, like her Mom, but she doesn't care for the hero thing at all.
<ul><li> Her Mom, Silk Spectre I, was a successful hero <em>because</em> she was a beauty. It was publicity to help her movie career.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Manhattan rebuilt himself in the shape of the ideal man and the classical hero, standing well over six feet with statuesque features. He even walks around naked. However, he doesn't care at all for heroism.
</li><li> The Comedian is tall, handsome and has "bad boy appeal", which also plays the trope straight except... he's not much of a hero. It straightens out again when his scars and age reduce his good looks to a rather leathery-looking ball of meat.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em>, physical beauty in general is not a good barometer for morality in a setting like this, even though some of the heroes do play it very straight.
<ul><li> Marv is a massive, ugly monster of a man but is also a good man.
</li><li> Ava Lord is pure evil but was extremely beautiful to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">she could easily manipulate almost any man into doing her bidding</a>.
</li><li> Junior was also fairly handsome and looked every bit the golden boy future President his father wanted him to become &mdash; too bad about the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Monster/ComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Monster/ComicBooks">"raping and killing little girls" hobby</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoFace">Two-Face</a></em> comic subverts this nicely. After he gets the surgery to fix the mangled side of his face his split personality is cured and he no longer needs the coin. Too bad the mangled side of his face represented the <em>good Harvey Dent</em>, and without it he sinks completely into evil and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">no longer held back</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">by his good side</a>.

They even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> it in one of the movie's best musical numbers. It's also lampshaded with Flynn's Wanted Poster, which portrays his criminal self as uglier than he actually is. This extends into the animated series, where the central antagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is a cute teenage boy</span>, though the art style as a whole removes the ugliness out of the equation thoroughly.

Throughout the movie, Kuzco gradually learns humility after being turned into a llama by the vengeful Yzma.

</li><li> Inverted in the 1953 sci-fi movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItCameFromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItCameFromOuterSpace">It Came from Outer Space</a></em> where the hideous one-eyed aliens are not launching a covert invasion of Earth; they only want to quietly repair their spaceship and leave without conflict.

When Bond meets with Columbo, he declares that, yes, he is a smuggler, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">he never smuggled heroin</a>, and that Kristatos is the real drug smuggler, having warned Bond that he may have to kill Columbo to knock out the competition.

</li><li> Lampshaded and subverted throughout <em>Passione d'Amore</em>. The good-looking male has an affair with a good-looking married woman. (She gets away with stringing him along because she's pretty.) Then, he gets sent to some backwater area and starts to interact with the local colonel's daughter, whom everybody agrees is quite ugly. It also shaped her character: even her parents avoided contact with her. She never gets a 'beautiful all along' makeover, but he eventually falls in love with her anyway. Then she dies. And he goes to tell his pretty lover that he isn't taking her shit anymore. It's mainly notable for the 'pretty dude/ugly woman' pairing.

</li><li> The US Navy's sexual harassment training videos subvert this trope. In an example of quid pro quo sexual harassment, the protagonist is an unattractive girl who does a good job and only wants recognition for her hard work. The two antagonists are a male sailor who has the power to pick the Sailor of the Quarter and an attractive blonde sailor who is chosen for this position with heavy implications that she is chosen only because she slept with the guy who makes the decisions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers">Small Soldiers</a></em> the owner of Globotech assumes the human Commando Elite are the heroes while the odd-looking Gorgonites should be the villains due to this trope.

</li><li> All over the place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>. All of the elves are impossibly beautiful, but while you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Elrond</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Galadriel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Tauriel</a>, you also have the unrepentantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> Thranduil, and Legolas is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. The orcs and goblins play this straight as well; they're just as cruel and wicked as they are hideous.

</li><li> The 2001 comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallowHal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallowHal">Shallow Hal</a></em> is about a superficial man being hypnotised into seeing people's inner beauty. His love interest looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GwynethPaltrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GwynethPaltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> to his eyes, but is in reality three hundred pounds overweight (although still portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a>). The flipside comes when a beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> in real life is then shown from Hal's POV as unattractive. Then again, Hal's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> of a best friend is shown to be less attractive than him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a></em>: Played with. The protagonists, the Gelflings, are obviously intended to be attractive, despite any Uncanny Valley that may be invoked by looking at them. The pure urRu are made to look noble and sagacious, and when they die, they fade into sparkles. The Skeksis, on the other hand, are clearly intended to look twisted, deformed and vulture-like, which is made even worse by their advanced age and the fact that the Emperor's body crumbles to pieces within seconds after his death. Aughra, however, is quite hideous and warty, yet proves to be a helpful character. A bit of background checking shows that in the grand scheme of things, she's actually supposed to be True Neutral, and not one to take sides. It gets really confusing with the Podlings, who are supposed to be a good, Closer to Earth race, yet somehow they wound up looking Ugly Cute at the same time. Brian Froud did admit that he toned down their appearance from the earliest incarnations, because those were far too grotesque and potato-like.

</li><li> The first story to intentionally and properly subvert the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E7TheSensorites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E7TheSensorites">"The Sensorites"</a> &mdash; the Sensorites are hideous beings (similar to the Ood in the new series) who are introduced to us performing a constant campaign of psychic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> on the occupants of a human spaceship, its hideous face appearing to us from behind a plate of glass as a cliffhanger. As soon as the Doctor starts communicating with the Sensorites, he realizes they are peace-loving beings prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryOverload">Sensory Overload</a>, misguidedly attacking the humans under erroneous beliefs, and soon patches things up between the ship occupants and the Sensorites. He spends most of the story helping the Sensorites from a gang of evil colonialist humans and protecting the good Sensorites from the token evil Sensorite politician.
</li><li> Played with from all angles by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E5TheBrainOfMorbius">"The Brain of Morbius"</a>.

Yet both Solon and Condo are obsessed with the beauty of the Doctor and Sarah respectively (the good guys) &mdash; Condo even tells Sarah that she's better than him because she's pretty, while Solon is fascinated at first sight by the Doctor's face and decides it would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist">perfect head</a> for the body he's building for the psychotic Morbius &mdash; the Doctor, interestingly, isn't conventionally handsome but is very striking and magnetic. The Doctor and Sarah make fun of Morbius' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">ugliness</a> compared to their own good looks when confronting him at the end of the story, but it's because it's a sore point for Morbius, who (it is implied) was known for his charismatic good looks in his last body and claims to experience agony from the sheer experience of being what he currently is. And Sarah only shows fear of Morbius when she sees him for the first time, and is very blas&eacute; about him (even trying to help him!) when she's blinded.

The heroine is a princess who, whilst outwardly beautiful, is arrogant and mean-spirited.

Not sure if this would be a subversion, aversion, or some variation, but the women in "Mudd's Women" are actually very ugly unless they take a pill which makes them radiantly beautiful. It's later revealed to be a case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect">Placebo Effect</a>, and the women's beauty was merely a factor of their self-confidence.

</li><li> Spock himself quoted this trope in the episode "Is There In Truth No Beauty", commenting on the Greek ideal that "what is beautiful must therefore be good." The episode subverted: Kollos, a member of a race described as so ugly that no one can look at them without going mad, turns out to be friendly and helpful when he shares minds with Spock, but his human aide Miranda, while very attractive, is cold and aloof, and later jealous of Kollos' bond with Spock. Kirk himself admits, "Most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness &mdash; one of the last of our prejudices."

<ul><li> At one point, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> describes Abram (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulRename" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulRename">later Abraham</a>) worried someone might try to steal his wife Sarai (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulRename" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulRename">later Sarah</a>) because he "realized she was beautiful." The Talmud interprets this to mean that she <em>was</em> physically attractive, but that Abram/Abraham connected to her on a spiritual level, so he would have found her beautiful no matter <em>how</em> she looked; he only realized other men might fancy her years after they had been married.
<ul><li> It's also been noted that the matriarchs are only described as beautiful when they're also being connected with positive traits; however, rather than playing this trope straight, the interpretations are either a.) beauty only matters when it <em>accentuates</em> goodness or b.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">one should find goodness to be beautiful, not beauty to be good</a>.
</li><li> The Messiah, on the other hand, is explicitly described by Isaiah as being ugly, so that no one would be distracted by carnal desire.
<ul><li> In keeping with their belief as Christians that Jesus was the Messiah, early descriptions of Jesus were of a short, ugly, hairy man with dark skin and wooly hair. Even early icons of Jesus (before 800 CE) show a very scary, angry-looking guy. Early Roman critics of Christianity, such as Celsus, bring up Jesus's ugliness to mock Christians without realizing it was probably they who spread the description in the first place.

</li><li> Also inverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>, who was formerly the angel Lucifer ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">light-bearer</a>").

However, according to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Midrashic interpretations</a>, she was haughty, arrogant, and made her (mostly Jewish) servant-girls do things like work on the Sabbath or eat unkosher food. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5i1au');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5i1au" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5i1au');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (Even though the text supports <em>none</em> of this.

Descriptions of most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Space Marines</a> fit the "ruggedly handsome" image, but they're the result of massive genetic engineering and are described by most normal humans as strikingly inhuman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Sisters of Battle</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Eldar</a> are often portrayed as beautiful in artwork but books, official content, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> all agree that they're anything but. Physical beauty is also one of the most common gifts bestowed by Chaos God Slaanesh, Prince of Excess and Debauchery.
<ul><li> The reasons that the Sisters of Battle don't look as good as their tabletop models are scarring, tattoos, weight, missing body parts, and them not giving a damn about personal appearance.
</li><li> "Though there was no disguising his inhumanity [...] there was the overgrown gigantism of the face, that particular characteristic of the Astartes, almost equine". That's Captain Loken, the definitive Good Guy of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> book, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett">Dan Abnett</a>'s <em>Horus Rising</em>. Also, the book gives us an idea of how much Space Marines stink after some time in their powered armor. On the other hand, most Primarchs, who are even taller than Marines, are godlike beautiful.

She's the Dark Elf Hag Witch who kills children and bathes in their blood. That fat frog guarded by the huge, frightening lizards she's fighting? The frog's a Slann Mage-Priest, and those lizards are Temple Guards, among the noblest soldiers in the world.
</li><li> Played straight to the point of absurdity however with the literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> servants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Chaos</a>, who have an <em>explicit rule</em> that the more they devote themselves to Chaos the more mind-warpingly horrific they become, with the final fate of any Chaos follower being either a gibbering Chaos Spawn with more limbs than IQ points or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">massive Daemon Prince</a> with dominion over their own slice of hell.
</li><li> And subverted again with followers of Slaanesh, who are described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Disturbingly beautiful</a> at worst. The ability of the artists and modelers to convey this, however, varies due to individual skill and decency laws.
<ul><li> Though played disturbingly straight with Slaanesh's two champions in 40K, Lucius and Fulgrim. Fulgrim was one of the most beautiful primarchs while on the side of the Emperor, but now he's a four-armed snake thing. Likewise, Lucius was called a pretty boy by his allies because he had never taken an injury in battle. You only start seeing his ugly side after Loken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">breaks his nose</a>, and when he truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">turns</a>, he starts cutting his face up whenever he kills someone. Hence how he looks in the 41st millennium.
</li></ul></li><li> Sigvald the Magnificent, Slaanesh's champion in Fantasy, is a Viking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> whose feet don't even touch the ground so as not to get them dirty with every aspect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist">The Fighting Narcissist</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">Camp Straight</a> you can imagine. He's also a sadist who once torched a city because he didn't like the wine, and his entire unit carries polished shields so he can admire himself whenever he feels like it (the in-game explanation for his having the Stupidity rule).
</li><li> And to perhaps complete the cycle, there is the case of the Chaos god Nurgle, horrifying and ugly in the most maximal senses of the word, and that&#146;s without factoring in the virulent plagues and diseases has coursing through the very air he resides in, let alone his skin. Bloated, dead-looking, maggots and worms writhing everywhere, and one of his attributes is kindness. His followers while all hideously ugly as well, and bloated/diseased, are nonetheless also jovial and welcoming. To make it even more insane, when the Eldar pantheon fell in the birth of Slaanesh, the goddess of fertility, healing, and presumably beauty, Isha, was captured by Slaanesh to be his/her/it's plaything forever. When she screamed and begged for help across the cosmos, none other than Nurgle and his followers wage war on Slaanesh to get Isha out. Nurgle kept her in his garden then and had her drink his plagues - she, of course, could heal herself, and so would then tell all mortals how to rid themselves of his plagues. While she could leave, canon seems to indicate she willingly stays with Nurgle. He absolutely adores her, and likewise, she loves him.
</li><li> The Dark Eldar greatly value physical perfection and beauty and look the part, their telltale deathly pallor, a consequence of living in a realm with no real sun, notwithstanding. They also happen to be utterly repugnant hedonistic monsters. The black hollow soul of a Dark Eldar is one of the worst things a psyker can see with his/her witch-sight.
</li></ul></li><li> Completely averted with D&amp;D Tieflings. 2e Tieflings are sexy, usually evil, and possess only a few 'subtle' signs of their heritage (small horns, glowing eyes, etc). 4e Tieflings are hideous and almost always good.
</li><li> A third party publication for Third Edition subverts this even more with Amazons: all of them are stunningly beautiful women, on the other hand, they are bloodthirsty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">Neutral Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">near-literal feminazis</a> who kill men at sight and\or rape them for reproduction, to the point they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">gleefully</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">bash their male children's head to pulp against trees</a>.

</li><li> Swords and Scorcery Creature Collection - Subverted with False Lovers, paragons of charm and beauty, who can effortlessly win the hearts and souls of any who look upon them. They are able to inspire heroes and heroines to great deeds, give birth to new forms of art and literature, and transform cultures of entire kingdoms with their wit and grace. Yet, ultimately they will betray those dreams, leave a trail of broken lives in their wake, and crush the spirits of those who loved them simply for the evulz. They hide their true cursed nature behind powerful illusions that maintain the semblance of whom they once were before their looks began to wane in the passing of time.

</li></ul></li><li> The various games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> series have both subverted this trope and played it straight. Of particular note is <em>Warcraft III</em>, in which the stereotypically ugly orc Thrall rises to become one of Azeroth's greatest heroes, while stereotypically handsome human Arthas falls to irredeemable evil (though he becomes less handsome when he becomes a Death Knight.
<ul><li> Many of <em>Warcraft</em>'s protagonists aren't traditionally attractive and all but Turalyon and Thrall have been older men. Even Malfurion, an Elf, was a large elderly man with a long grizzly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">beard</a>. The Antagonists are almost always pretty ugly, however.
<ul><li> An inversion being the race of Succubi. However they play with this trope as well as they fall in love with their master relatively commonly - and it happens no matter how hideously ugly the summoner can be.
</li><li> It's possible that to demonic senses, which include aura vision and some telepathy, anybody with the magical and mental attributes needed to summon and bind a succubus (and retain life and sanity) is beautiful by definition, one way or another.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Pointed out on two occasions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first case, playable character Fir gets manipulated by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a>, gonkish pirate into believing he's a good person, and the protagonists are invading pirates. When one of the protagonists points out the pirate's thuggish appearance, Fir sarcastically says "Well that's what I get for listening to my mom, and not judging people for their appearance." Note, Fir's mom was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to a large, and thuggish looking man.
</li><li> In the second, the large, and ugly Gonzales is made an outcast for his grotesque appearance, and forced into the service of the villains. One of the protagonists ends up treating him like a person, and he undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, Benny and Charlotte turn this trope on their head. Benny <em>looks</em> intimidating to the point where his personal skill uses that to scare the enemies into dropping a couple stats when in reality he's gentle, easily frightened and shy. Charlotte, on the other hand, is a total hottie who puts on a cutesy face to attract men but is actually a harsh, cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">Lad-ette</a>. They're actually old friends and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foils</a> to one another, and they can get married if you pursue their supports.
</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> games subvert this with Igor, a diminutive hunched old man with bulging, bloodshot eyes, pointed ears, a fiendish grin, and a foot-long nose, who helps the good guys develop their powers while claiming he's just fulfilling his own obligations. In other games, however, he's the trope played straight &mdash; you're not <em>supposed</em> to trust him. And he does outright state he's doing all this for his own reasons&mdash; they just happen to align with the hero's this time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite actually being named Beauty, the female agent of the blue people is probably the most cold-hearted, having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kidnapped and threatened a little girl. Beauty was apparently willing to kill her if Sissel stuck around.</span> Even her fawning admirer Dandy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">took offense</a> to being cruel to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kamilla</span>, though he was complicit in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kidnapping</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yomiel</span> isn't bad-looking (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">Anime Hair</a> aside, possibly), but is also a depraved criminal. Played straight when he ends up redeeming himself, though not after going through quite a lot.
</li></ul></li><li> Oddly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion">Yggdra Union</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">partially due to the artstyle</a>; every bad guy from the lowest mook to the cruelest boss is cute as hell.
</li><li> Almost subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>. One of the few attractive characters (most of them being alien or plain) does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>, and probably the closest thing to good guys in the game are aliens who are only somewhat humanoid... except for Jim Raynor, who is a classic rough-hewn hero and, with one exception, easily the most moral person in the entire series thus far.
<ul><li> From another viewpoint, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> can be seen to be completely neutral in this respect, as every race and character is crafted to be both good and evil, in one way or another. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Protoss are noble, but are all but undone by their traditions and hubris; the Terran are very versatile but are almost constantly fighting amongst themselves for power and resources; the Zerg are the stereotypical 'evil' race but are the only race that's striving to better themselves, and being a hivemind, they have the highest 'integrity' of the races (until a human enters the Swarm and the Overmind dies, which results in said human fighting with the Cerebrates for control over the Swarm...)</span> As far as attractiveness is concerned - beauty is in the eye of the beholder... or in this case, the player. Take, for instance, the release of the Zerg models for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> by Blizzard - the entire fanbase was falling over themselves in adoration of their favourite spiny, scaled and virulent units.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>: While five out of the six Horde races are ugly and monstrous, the Horde itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">isn't particularly evil</a>...and the attractive blood elves are one of the most unpleasant of the Horde races. As for the Alliance, the vaguely demonic-looking draenei are usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> and probably the most honorable of the lot.
<ul><li> Then played straight when the draenei&mdash;particularly draenei women&mdash;became very obvious perpetual fanservice. Fanart has <em>very</em> quickly caught up to reflect this.
</li><li> Played straight in a Horde quest in the latest expansion, where players help overthrow a cruel but incompetent Orc commander in favour of her more noble sister. The tyrant uses one of the "ugly" Orc female faces with red eyes and a perpetual snarl, while the sister has the most conventionally attractive face available to Orcs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheKasai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheKasai">Rise of the Kasai</a></em> features four playable characters, three of which subvert this trope. Baumusu and Grizz are both old men, Baumusu is bald, burly, heavyset, and is missing an eye. Grizz is wrinkly, thin as a rail, has a huge nose, and is also balding. Both are noble and honorable heroes. Tati is a very attractive female, but is the most morally questionable of the four, to the point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that she can make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> at the end of the game.</span> Her brother Rau arguably plays this straight as he's a fairly handsome man and arguably the most noble of all four of them. This is played straight with most of the villains, however. The big bad is especially hideous. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">The Twins</a> are supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">very attractive</a> to the point of being able to mind control men, but the game's graphics and the haziness of the scene makes it something of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">Informed Attractiveness</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou Project</a></em> series, hideous and otherwise monstrous entities, some of whom even state outright that they do/have done things we might otherwise consider repugnant in their lives, have been turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">Cute Monster Girls</a>. They are also extremely well-loved by both their creator and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fandom">Fandom</a>, even if "human" is their main delicacy.
<ul><li> Then there is Saigyou Ayakashi which uses its beauty to lure people to it and then drain their souls.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em>, as the bad guys are brutish and ugly compared to the Witchers, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars">scarred enough to increase their masculine charm</a>. Act I ends in a conflict between a beautiful witch who has been the town's doctor, and an unruly mob who sell their own children into slavery. This trope fades as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">good and evil become less clear</a>, and by the end, both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> are equally immaculately handsome in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">finely-crafted armor</a>.
</li><li> Though it has many straight examples of this trope, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> also has numerous subversions in all three games of the series.
<ul><li> In the first game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Urdnot Wrex</a> is just as ugly and ferocious-looking as most Krogan, and sports a number of old battle scars on his face; however, though he's admittedly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, Wrex is surprisingly amiable for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Warlord-turned-Mercenary</a> and goes on to become a leader and reformer among the Krogan populace in the sequels.
</li><li> Turians aren't exactly handsome by human standards, sporting insectoid mandibles and spikey exoskeletons; however, the one that joins your team, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlySniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlySniper">Garrus Vakarian</a> ends up becoming one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Shepard's</a> closest friends. This is subverted even further in the second game when Garrus gets shot in the face by an enemy gunship; though he survives, he's inflicted with permanent scarring and plastic surgery isn't brought out as an easy way to keep him "handsome." This doesn't affect his morality in the slightest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">Mordin Solus</a> is a very old Salarian with a number of old facial scars from his time in the STG, and is missing one of his cranial horns. Though he's a bit on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyAmbiguousDoctorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorallyAmbiguousDoctorate">morally ambiguous side</a>, there's no denying that he's still a hero who does his best to ensure the safety of his patients and the galaxy at large. After all, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">the Very Model of a Scientist Salarian.</a>
</li><li> In a far more alien example than most, the Rachni Queen might be a terrifying insectoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen">Hive Queen</a> that speaks through the bodies of the dead and dying and her species did engulf the galaxy in war several centuries ago, but she isn't inherently evil. In fact, she's just been imprisoned and enslaved as a means of creating shock-troops; if you release her, she joins forces with you out of gratitude and honours her promise without any backstabbing.
</li><li> Morinth, one of your optional team-members from the second game, is a beautiful Asari with class and sophistication on her side.

</li></ul></li><li> In the World Builder game <em>Ray's Maze: A Mess O' Trouble</em>, you encounter two ancient beings sealed away, an ugly lizard-like creature and a luminescent angel-like woman. Turns out the lizard-like creature is the good one, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">the angel-like one is the evil one</a>, and after the latter escapes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">with</a> or without your help) and vaporizes the former you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">seal her away again</a>.
</li><li>The visual novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SayaNoUta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SayaNoUta">Saya no Uta</a></em> is about a medical student who was in a car accident that damages his brain and causes him to hallucinate that everything around him is literally made out of blood and gore and the people are all monsters. He falls deeply in love with a girl named Saya, who actually <em>is</em> an interdimensional mutant that he perceives as normal because of his distorted senses. He eventually alienates all of his original friends, goes insane, and kills them all while Saya follows him as faithfully as a puppy. He doesn't even care when he finds out that she's a mutant because she's literally the only person in the world that he can stand to be around. He even starts eating human flesh at one point because all five of his senses are distorted, including his sense of taste.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> simultaneously plays this trope straight and subverts it. The protagonists of the story mode are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">Badass Adorable</a> Inklings, while the antagonistic Octarians range from outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonks</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Ugly Cute</a> at best. The elite Octarian forces, however, are made up of humanoid Octolings that are just as cute as the Inklings. All of this isn't even taking into account that the Octarians are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">not even "evil" so much as they are on the opposite side of a war</a>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> in that while literally every playable female character is made to be attractive to a demographic in the audience and the vast majority of the girls are good it's sole female villainess Juri is just as attractive as any other lady in the game and can even appeal to a certain crowd more than any of the good girls can.
<ul><li> The most straight forward example is probably Cammy. While all the dolls would probably turn good if they wanted to and all the dolls are attractive in their own right (and have similar bodies to Cammy), Cammy herself has turned good and her beauty is accentuated by her soft eyes, fairer skin, and clothes that show her off more.
</li><li> Ibuki averts in her comic is shown that she would still be attractive in a more evil way if she stayed with the Geki clan rather than taken from them by her master Enjo when she was still an infant. She would have used more makeup among other techniques but still would have been a ruthless killer compared to the more natural girl who is cutesy and good she ended up becoming.
</li><li> Birdie averts this in his own way for a male character. He was never "beautiful" in his own right and especially
</li></ul></li></ul>not compared to the girls who all are made to be attractive, but early on he was a criminal out of his own accord when he had muscles and younger. Now he is older, fatter, and uglier and now fights the good fight working under Karin as long as she feeds him.

<ul><li> It's hard to convey beauty in a cartoony style, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest">Sinfest</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">Informed Attractiveness</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2012-01-06">is used<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to convey the depths of Lil' Evil's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">Amnesiac Dissonance</a>.

</li><li> Sergeant Schlock of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em> is an... interesting variation on this trope.

<ul><li> On the other hand, thanks to genetic engineering, any genes that can make a person "unattractive," have been weeded out. One character even mentions that all of humanity's females now have ample bosoms. Interestingly, this subverts the trope harshly, as it means that if you're a human, then you can be good or evil and still be pretty.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, multiple characters, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>, comment that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillPolitical">Kankri</a> is really cute and adorable-looking.

<ul><li> Played straight and inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyLovelyLocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyLovelyLocks">Lady Lovely Locks</a></em>: the hero, "Lady Lovely Locks" is good and has lovely blonde hair, while her enemy is Duchess Raven Waves, a beautiful princess and troublemaker. (This series was made to appeal to young girls.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> had a few aversions, and at least one deliberate subversion: In the episode "Fugitive Flowers", the main characters help a group of sentient flowers escape from the "crabnasties"; they regret it later when it turns out the crabnasties are a police force, and the "flories" are escaped convicts. It becomes clear that their respective appearance made it hard for Posey to consider, but all in all, the ugly crabnasties end being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> of the episode.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, the parasprites are utterly adorable. They also constantly eat any and all food they can find (and, after Twilight messes them up with magic, any <em>non-food</em> they can find) and reproduce in a revolting manner. The fourth gen is generally devoid of ugly mook villains - the changelings are bug-like but still fairly aesthetically pleasing, Sombra and Nightmare Moon were sinister but attractive, and Discord's mismatched appearance makes him look weird and strange rather than ugly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Discord ultimately becomes a straight-up inversion when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">reforms</a>: He looks his usual chaotic and borderline ugly self, but other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButNotTamed">being kind of a jerk</a> he is ultimately a good person... pony... <em>thing</em>.</span>
</li><li> Played with in <em>Bats!</em> during the song sequence <em>Stop The Bats</em>. When Applejack sings about them they are drawn as hideous buck-toothed gremlin things, and when Fluttershy sings about them they're drawn as fluffy and cute. Applejack sees them as monsters because of the threat they pose to her farm and livelihood, while Fluttershy sees them as cute because she sympathizes with them.
</li><li> This may be as much a consequence of the art style making ugly almost impossible. The changeling soldiers, for example, can easily be seriously monstrous in more detailed but otherwise accurate artwork.
</li><li> Zigzagged with Starlight Glimmer, who is a rather cute unicorn. In her first appearance, she was a completely unrepentant villain straight from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarrisonBergeron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarrisonBergeron">Harrison Bergeron</a></em> who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">gone Stalin</a> on a town and was at best a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>. In her second appearance she was a fully evil villain... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the last few minutes where we learn her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">tragic backstory</a>, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">forgiven by Twilight</a>, and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> to the team, landing her as a completely straight example in the end.</span>
</li><li> As suspected by "Kevin's" appearance in <em>Slice Of Life</em> and later confirmed in <em>The Times Are A Changeling</em>, there <em>are</em> individual changelings that are peaceful and even good, despite looking like bug/horse hybrids. Again, they ultimately become an entirely straight example when it's revealed in <em>To Where And Back Again</em> that "good" changelings turn into colorful pretty <a class="urllink" href="https://derpibooru.org/1449701">fairy-moose-beetle-horse<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">things</a>. Fan reaction was... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">very mixed to say the least</a>. Being shapeshifters, they could well be invoking this to be less intimidating to ponies.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the episode "Stage Fright" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot">My Life as a Teenage Robot</a></em>. Jenny, who was rejected from performing in the school's dramatic production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, believes the school is playing the trope straight by accepting only human actors, but when aliens crash land and attempt to warn everyone of an alien invasion (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">simply by shouting "Alien invasion!"</a>), Jenny is quick to face them on the grounds that they're hideous. When the <em>actual</em> invaders arrive, they're beautiful energy beings with slight feminine figures...who quickly attempt to conquer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, both Jenny <em>and</em> the uglier aliens are cast in the school play as the leading roles.</span>
</li><li> Inverted with many of the villainous contestants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>. Heather, Justin, Courtney, and Alejandro are all considered extremely attractive. Scott, Mal, and Scarlett less so, but they do each have some level of appeal. Jo, Max, and Sugar play the trope straight.
<ul><li> Generally speaking however, the show zig-zags quite a bit with the trope, as there are plenty of very attractive contestants in the series who are also known for being good and kind. Bridgette, Trent, Lindsay, and Geoff are prime examples among the first generation contestants, while Zoey and Jasmine are probably the best played-straight examples with the <em>Revenge of the Island</em> and <em>Pahkitew Island</em> casts respectively.
</li><li> Further playing with the trope is that while there are many contestants who are both very attractive and good people, the contestants who end up being the ultimate &#147;heroes&#148; of the season by making it all the way to the end (or close to it) and taking down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> are usually more average-looking. In Season 1, the two heroes to ultimately defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Heather</a> are Owen and Gwen. Owen, while not ugly, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">obese</a> and not really attractive to anyone except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Izzy</a>. Gwen is cute, but also aloof, socially awkward, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">Goth</a>, so while she does have appeal to certain other contestants (i.e. Trent, Cody, and Duncan), contestants like Heather, Bridgette, and Lindsay are considered much more conventionally attractive by the majority. In Season 2, the only unambiguous hero to outlast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Courtney and win (or be runner-up, depending on the ending) is Beth, who is slightly overweight and still looks like a kid, meaning she basically just looks average. While the &#147;hero&#148; of Season 3 is Heather who is very attractive, she is also only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">hero by default</a>, because of being slightly more good than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Alejandro</a> and the only one capable of beating him. The highest-ranking unambiguously good contestant is Cody, who got 3rd, and like Beth, still looks like a kid. Season 4 has Cameron as the only hero to make it to the final challenge (therefore, outlasting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Scott), and then beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Light</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">ning</a> in the final challenge (in most endings). He is also a scrawny nerd and definitely not any sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a>. Season 5 finally breaks the trend with Zoey, who is extremely attractive and the only hero to outlast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mal</a>. Then Season 6 continues that trend with the beautiful Sky, who along with the other hero Shawn, is one of only two contestants to both beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sugar</a> and overcome the sabotage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Dave</a> during the final challenge. Shawn though, like the majority of his predecessors, still looks average.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> series Ridonculous Race then follows the usual pattern of the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> team Josee and Jacques (the Ice Dancers) are a definite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a>, respectively, and get 3rd. That team&#146;s main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> duo, and one of the two teams to defeat them, is the Police Cadets. Both of whom are pretty average-looking and definitely not distinctly attractive like the villains. Especially Macarthur, who is both more heavyset and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">enjoys frequently indulging in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">Toilet Humor</a>. However, the other team to beat the Ice Dancers team is the Surfer Dudes, who are pretty good-looking, but also not really involved in a rivalry with the Big Bads like the Police Cadets were. Although the trope did get pretty close to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played straight</a> here, since 4th Place team The Sisters were both extremely attractive, both clearly heroic (arguably even moreso than the two winning hero teams, due to Macarthur bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> at times by her willingness to stoop to the Ice Dancers&#146; level to beat them, and the Surfer Dudes more or less being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">Dumb Is Good</a> and not taking the competition too seriously), got focus on par with the other final teams before their elimination, and had a rivalry with Josee and Jacques too. Meaning they would have qualified if placing just a little bit higher.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a> use this trope to her advantage. As long as she's in water, she looks like a beautiful mermaid and gives the group a sob story about how she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">the last mermaid in the world,</a> being hunted by an evil Viking. She's pretty, the Viking is ugly...naturally, they believe her until the Viking sets them straight&mdash;<em>he's</em> the good guy here, and she's a monster. Then it turns out that, out of the water, the mermaid becomes a hideous giant monster.

<ul><li> The episode "Good and Ugly" did this, with the heroes having to choose which of two visiting aliens to help; the good guy turned out to be the ugly one. They even ended the episode with a "good and ugly" joke.
</li><li> Of course the show usually plays the trope straight with the ThunderCats all being portrayed as attractive, while their enemies, Mumm-Ra, the Mutants, and Lunataks are ugly.
</li></ul></li><li> The Guardian Angel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> uses this trope to get Finn to trust her immediately. Big mistake.
<ul><li> Finn does this a lot, although he doesn't appear to necessarily judge by "beautiful" so much as "cute and helpless".
<ul><li> The show itself mostly avoids this, with adorable characters such as Me-Mow and the Cutie King being evil and the comparatively hideous Cinnamon Bun and Tree Trunks being the sweetest of the characters.
</li><li> However, when Princess Bubblegum becomes temporarily ugly, she immediately becomes more vicious.

When Zuko is first introduced the viewers' attention is immediately drawn to his huge facial scar, and he at first seems a fairly stereotypical arrogant, hot-tempered villain. However, once the initial shock of his disfigurement has passed, you start to notice that he would actually be a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> without it, and he soon starts getting a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and revealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> as the series progresses. Plus, once Zuko's hair gets a bit longer, it draws a bit less attention to his scar. The scar is also later a sign of his inner good, as his benevolence is what got him the scar in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Fire Lord Ozai</a> is another case of playing with this trope, as his face is obscured with shadow for his first appearances, but his cruelty and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">menacing voice</a> are very clear, making the eventual discovery that he is just as handsome as Zuko would have been without the scar that much more surprising.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch">Azula</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> are all physically attractive, and they are all bad guys. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The two sidekicks eventually have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, but Azula remains evil throughout</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Uncle Iroh</a> is one of the few firebenders who is clearly good right from the start, and he is a fat, blunt-featured old man.
</li><li> On the good guys' side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Katara</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Suki</a> are the only ones who would be called conventionally beautiful. While none of the characters are really <em>un</em>attractive, their appearances tend to be somewhat goofy or unusual, and any attractiveness has more to do with their personalities than appearances.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> carries on the tradition of its predecessor by playing with the trope. It's especially notable for Asami, who initially appears to subvert it by having a design that encompasses numerous traits usually affiliated with villains. She looks like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EeriePaleSkinnedBrunette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EeriePaleSkinnedBrunette">Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette</a>, she wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeupIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeupIsEvil">makeup</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveEvilEyeshadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveEvilEyeshadow">eyeshadow</a>, dresses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAndBlackAndEvilAllOver">black and red</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">captures Mako's heart with minimal effort</a>. But it turns out that this trope is played perfectly straight with her; she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheepInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheepInSheepsClothing">Sheep in Sheep's Clothing</a> and is just as good on the inside as she is on the outside who becomes a core member of Team Avatar all the way to the end of the series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a> have a "Substitute Creature" that covers for Ms. Keane. They think he is evil because he is a monster and fear the worse. It turns out he is a nice guy and sets the girls straight.

They initially assume the teacher is a man and are willing to bring down the full force of the law on the sicko, but when Kyle says it's a woman teacher, the cops are very confused. Then they ask Kyle if she's ugly, implying they'd still be willing to arrest her if she was, but since she's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes">a hot blonde</a>, they want to congratulate Ike for "scoring" instead.
</li><li> Jack himself from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> is a very straight example of this, but is also one of the only few. There are many neutral or even outright heroic characters such as The Scotsman who is <em><a class="urllink" href="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/036/3/d/The_Scotsman_by_Balnazar.png">hideous<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></em> and his wife who is <a class="urllink" href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11123/111235780/4605854-bzzqecg.gif">even worse<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, along with many very strange and odd-looking species.

<ul><li> Notorious female outlaws were often very unattractive, possibly due to being social outcasts, but the ones who were attractive often used their beauty to their advantage.
</li><li> This trope came out to play regarding Susan Boyle. When she walked on stage, the judges of <em>Britain's Got Talent</em> looked at her awkward appearance and assumed she was going to be a total disaster. When an amazing voice comes out of her mouth, the judges were visibly floored and left commentators asking why we assume lack of physical beauty automatically means lack of talent.
</li><li> During the globally-televised opening of the 2008 Bejing Olympics, a cute girl lip-synced a beautiful song while an unattractive girl hidden behind the stage sang the actual song.

And they're on <em>our</em> side. They're harmless to humans, tend to only come out when we're asleep, don't damage foodstuffs or household structures, and prey on every kind of household pest that does<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note65yvp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note65yvp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note65yvp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Spiders, ants, bed bugs, cockroaches, silverfish, termites, you name it</span>. They also serve as a radar; an abundance of these benevolent creepy-crawlies will give you a heads up that you undoubtedly have an as-of-yet unnoticed infestation of something else.
