After the side-series <em>The Bane Chronicles</em> was published, fans thought that they would uncover the events after the reveal of the chapter entitled "What Really Happened in Peru", but it's still never revealed. In fact, Magnus himself has no idea why he's been declared <em>persona non grata</em> by the High Council of Peruvian Warlocks.

As a result, he's floundering in many aspects of Vulcan mental discipline. This is extensively dealt with in <em>Dreadnought!</em>, while in <em>Battlestations!</em> a Vulcan on the transwarp development team has taken Sarda under his wing and helped him make progress in this area.

<ul><li> They're banned from the town of Esparto, California, after the finale of the "Knock Your Socks Off" myth, where they underestimated the size of the explosion they set off. The shockwave knocked people off sofas, broke windows, set off car alarms, and knocked down ceiling tiles in the town. Not to be outdone, the local news made it sound like the MythBusters had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MikeNelsonDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MikeNelsonDestroyerOfWorlds">leveled the town</a>.
<div class="indent">"And that's why we can never go to Esparto again."
</div></li><li> While never stated verbatim in any episode, there was a period of time (after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">errant cannonball incident</a> there) where the MythBusters were banned from the Alameda County Sheriff's Facility and had to conduct their tests at a bomb range in Yolo County.
</li></ul></li><li> Ben Wyatt of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em> was run out of his hometown of Partridge after his short run as the town's mayor ended in disaster thanks to his pet project (an expensive winter sports complex) bankrupting the town. The episode "Partridge" reveals that even after almost twenty years have passed, the residents still bear a pretty intense grudge over it. Ben ultimately renounces the town, stating Pawnee is his new home now.
</li><li> Mere hours before her debut on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace">Rupauls Drag Race</a></em> season 12, it was announced that contestant Sherry Pie had been disqualified from the competition over multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Because the entire season (except for the finale) was already filmed and ready to air by that point, the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a> could do was deemphasize Sherry Pie in the edit as much as possible in real-time, going as far as removing most of her confessionals and having at least one of her runway walks cut entirely from an episode. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1c12l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1c12l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1c12l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The consensus on the reason for this happening is that it was an officially sanctioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney-themed</a> runway and they didn't want their brand associated with her, but this hasn't been outright confirmed.</span> This was especially noticeable and jarring for viewers, however, because she won multiple challenges throughout the season, leading VH1 to match her prize winnings as donations to the Trevor Project. It was also made clear early on that she wouldn't be invited to the pre-taped live finale episode later in the year, leading some to hypothesize that she originally made it to the final four and it was pre-emptive damage control on VH1's part.
</li><li> There are a handful of hosts and musical guests on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> who have caused so much trouble, whether backstage or on the show itself, that they can never appear on the show again:
<ul><li> Louise Lasser hosted the penultimate episode of Season 1 (1975-76). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LorneMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LorneMichaels">Lorne Michaels</a> has gone on record in saying that Lasser was incoherent during her performance and wouldn't appear in any sketches unless she was by herself or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of which, Chevy Chase is banned from hosting (after doing so nine times, the record for a former cast member) due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> attitude toward the writers and cast members. He has made cameos in a few episodes, but hasn't hosted since Season 22 (1996-97).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiltonBerle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiltonBerle">Milton Berle</a> hosted the April 14, 1979 episode, where he consistently upstaged other performers, mugged non-stop to the camera, and gave an unscripted performance of "September Rain". Michaels banned him from the show in response.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal">Steven Seagal</a> hosted the April 20, 1991 episode, and was banned soon afterwards because he had difficulty working with the cast and crew, often pitching lousy sketch ideas and getting angry that none of them were picked. A later episode had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicolasCage">Nicolas Cage</a> lament to Lorne Michaels that his monologue made him look like "the biggest jerk on the show":
<div class="indent"><strong>Michaels:</strong> No, no. That would be Steven Seagal.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinLawrence">Martin Lawrence</a> hosted an episode in Season 19 (1993-94) where he launched into a graphic monologue about the decline in women's hygiene and has been banned ever since. All reruns cut off Lawrence's monologue and replace it with cards explaining why it can never air on TV again. It doesn't help that this was the episode immediately following the infamous Alec Baldwin-hosted show with the "Canteen Boy Goes Camping" sketch (where Canteen Boy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamSandler">Adam Sandler</a>) is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> molested by his scoutmaster</span>).
</li><li> Musical guest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SineadOConnor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SineadOConnor">Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor</a> was banned after ripping up a picture of Pope John Paul II and calling him "the true enemy" after her second song. The segment itself has been banned outside of specific pieces about <em>SNL</em>'s most controversial moments.
</li><li> Musical guest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CypressHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CypressHill">Cypress Hill</a> (on the season 19 episode hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShannenDoherty">Shannen Doherty</a>) was banned after DJ Muggs trashed the dressing room and lit a joint on-camera.
</li><li> Musical Guest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fear">Fear</a> (on the season seven episode hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldPleasence">Donald Pleasence</a>, which is itself banned for its dark, disgusting humor) was banned after a profanity-laden and set-destroying performance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> is unique in that his ban was his idea. In 1983, due to his controversial stint wresting women, he suggested that viewers phone-in to ban him or allow him to continue appearing on SNL. The majority picked banning him, and he never appeared on SNL again.
</li><li> A couple of people are commonly believed to have been banned but technically aren't:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdrienBrody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdrienBrody">Adrien Brody</a> hosted in Season 28 (2002-03) was supposedly banned for his performance. Some accounts suggest it was for introducing musical guest <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SeanPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SeanPaul">Sean Paul</a> in a rude-boy Jamaican get-up. Others suggest it was for ad-libbing, as Lorne Michaels utterly hates unscripted performances. It appears that the rumor that he was banned was started by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TinaFey">Tina Fey</a>, who apparently hated the idea of his hosting.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> was briefly banned after his first appearance in Season 3. He was slated to play "Less than Zero"; instead, he played "Radio Radio", a song critical of the music publishing establishment, which included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>. But his audacity was celebrated; he returned to the show in 1987, and he later took part in the show's 25th anniversary celebration by recreating his song switch.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>: Ronon accidentally goes back to a planet he previously visited as a runner.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, in expanding Klingon lore, introduced the concept of "discommendation", which runs this trope a little more literally than the norm. A discommendated Klingon is shunned so completely as to not be treated as a sentient being and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">to be referred to as "it"</a>. Only two cases were ever shown: one was eventually reversed thanks to his contribution to a change of power in the Empire, and the other (shown on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>) was very justifiably in his position.

</li><li> This is an aspect of Ferengi law: Ferengi who make grave violations of the law, such as breaking a contract with another Ferengi, may have their business license rescinded by the Ferengi Commerce Authority. Without a business license, Ferengi cannot conduct business with other Ferengi (and as spelled out by Rule of Acquisition #18, "A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all"), nor are they permitted to return to their homeworld of Ferenginar. Quark ends up having his license taken by the FCA in the Season 4 episode "Body Parts", but manages to have it reinstated a couple seasons later.
</li><li> As revealed in the episode "Rejoined", joined Trills who commit the taboo of rejoining &mdash; pursuing a relationship with someone from a symbiont's previous host &mdash; are liable to be exiled from the Trill homeworld. This also means that when the exiled host Trill dies, their symbiont will have no more hosts to join with, resulting in the death of the symbiont and the loss of their memories and knowledge, making this one taboo that very few joined Trill dare to commit.

</p><ul><li> In 1966, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> were invited to the Philippines to attend a breakfast reception with Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos at Malaca&ntilde;ang Palace. Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, politely declined the invitation on the band's behalf without their knowledge, unintentionally snubbing the Marcos household, since it had never been Epstein's policy to accept official invitations. The Marcos regime, who was not used to taking no for an answer, broadcast television footage of the seats reserved for the Fab Four, with Imelda saying that they had disappointed her and crying children. After the concert at Rizal Stadium, Epstein attempted to broadcast a public apology, only to be broadcast with distorted audio on government-owned Channel 5, and his words were rendered inaudible. Just before they were about to depart on an outgoing flight for Delhi, India, they learned that their room service and security protection had been revoked; irate Filpino citizens formed an angry mob, launching insults at them with the escalators turned off and no assistance was offered to carry their luggage. After moving towards a departure lounge, some thugs began beating and kicking them from one room to another, with angry Filipinos harassing them as they left the airport.

Some bars even had "No Yoshiki" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">"No Blondes"</a> (since Yoshiki and other VK rockers that tended to cause trouble often had blonde hair) signs, and the band still holds the record for most damage done to a Japanese hotel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungShui">Not just the room -- the entire hotel.</a>
</li><li> At one time, it was almost a point of pride for many punk rock, heavy metal, and hard rock bands to get themselves banned from venues and hotels, typically after trashing their rooms or starting riots at the venues, but also for violating local obscenity laws. Several have been banned from performing in entire states or countries, usually on obscenity grounds.

It turns out, though, that it's the <em>band</em> who didn't want to come back; the riot started when frontman Axl Rose spotted a bootlegger, which pressed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> and caused him to storm off the stage.

The 2014 "Gathering of the Juggalos" needed three tries to find a venue that was willing to deal with the complaints of their outraged neighbors. Shows involving ICP or other acts with similarly large juggalo followings are notoriously hated by venues in the live music world; while they do draw well, they have a reputation for unruly, unhygienic crowds who are prone to vandalism, fighting, attempting to sneak in banned items, and displays of public lewdness, and the Faygo showers that are a major part of ICP's live shows create unholy messes that are a nightmare to clean up.

The cops let it slide &mdash; until Webber began insulting the police onstage. This resulted in the venue cutting their power and the police forcibly removing them from the building. The ban was lifted after Jason Keyser took Webber's place on vocals, but with Webber back post-reunion, it is likely that they are banned once again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Unearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Unearth">Unearth</a> ran into some problems on their early run of tours due to founding bassist Chris Rybicki and his record with the authorities in Canada, which made entry for him and the band as a whole into the country difficult. This culminated in an incident in 2001 where the band set out for what vocalist Trevor Phipps later characterized as a "last shot" to get across the border with Rybicki, only to discover halfway there that he had stowed away a fifth of vodka prior to departure. Upon proving reluctant to simply dispose of the fifth despite pleas from the other members, Rybicki instead decided to hide it by <em>downing the entire fifth on his own</em> and then hide himself in the back of the tour van. Unfortunately, the band was stopped at the border and an inebriated Rybicki was discovered by the guards, at which point Unearth was turned away and Rybicki apparently slapped with a lifetime ban from Canada. This eventually forced Rybicki to leave the band so that they could gain entry to the country (and its numerous metalcore-friendly venues) with a new bassist (John Maggard).

</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Conventions</span> <br>Conventions are often hit with such bans, as some conventions tend to go overboard. In general, any convention or expo without a permanent location runs the risk of getting banned from certain venues, and all it takes is one or two idiots associated with them to do something stupid. Sometimes, the convention will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical">go to great lengths</a> to tell their guests to stop; other times, they wear getting banned as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">a badge of honor</a> (or at least sufficient quirkiness).

The hotel staff was clueless about what to expect, and they wound up putting business guests on the same floor as the party wing. Among the highlights were: an intoxicated person crashing <em>through</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWindowJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWindowJump">a plate-glass window</a>, sabotage to the fire alarm, broken elevators, several chandeliers being ripped down, and damage to the lobby artwork that reached five figures.

</li><li> The Seattle furry convention Rainfurrest was banned from its hotel after its 2015 event for large amounts of vandalism to the building costing large amounts of money. The attendees deliberately flooded rooms, which caused damage to nearby offices, and also wore fetish gear around the general public despite being told not to. Rampant public intoxication was another serious issue (including multiple overdoses), while individual incidents included tampering with a smoke alarm, shoving towels in the pump of a hot tub until the motor broke, and <em>tossing used adult diapers around the parking lot</em>. The convention couldn't find a new venue for 2016 and has effectively been cancelled indefinitely. The "Rainfurrest incident" made significant headway in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry Fandom</a>, leading them to be stricter about curbing bad convention behavior.

<ul><li> Some conventions have the "peanut butter and jelly" rule: nothing allowed in the masquerade that will make a mess of the stage or other contestant's costumes. This is traced back to a gentleman who entered a convention masquerade as indy comic book character "The Turd", by covering himself with chunky peanut butter. The body-temperature peanut butter began releasing peanut oil, permanently staining at least two other costumes and the hotel wallpaper ... and then there was the plumbing issues when he tried washing it off. There are unsubstantiated stories that the con found itself banned from that hotel afterwards. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4uaov');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4uaov" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4uaov');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Jelly was added to the rule after a "zombie" decided stage blood tasted bad and strawberry jam tasted good, so substituted the second for the first.

</li></ul></li><li> In general, people who either engage in egregious misbehavior or have a long history of idiotic, destructive, predatory, or generally unacceptable behavior that they have repeatedly been spoken to about to no avail can expect to receive bans from any well-run con (sometimes revocable if they can present a good case to the board and come back on a probationary basis, almost always irrevocable in the event of extreme or heinous misconduct, or after multiple failed attempts to clean up their act). Failing to abate or attempt to abate bad behavior is bad for business on multiple levels - failing to ban patrons who damage or steal property, leave gigantic messes, walk around intoxicated in public, or get into violent altercations with others will piss off hotels (who do talk, and if word gets out that you don't control your patrons, you may find yourself banned from an entire geographical area), while failing to ban known creeps or predators invites bad PR through fandom circles and can scare off vendors and guests. Cons that fail to take a hardline stance on bad behavior usually find themselves experiencing a slippery slope that leads to some sort of major incident, and occurrences like Rainfurrest 2015 (mentioned above) are almost always rooted in overly permissive policies that allow persistent bad actors to continue to attend.

(That said, they had to force him to <em>sell</em> the team, and he made out like a bandit.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueBaseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueBaseball">Major League Baseball</a> maintains a list of "permanently ineligible" people who are not allowed to have business associations with MLB or any of its affiliates (teams, minor leagues, Baseball Hall of Fame, current players via acting as their agents, <em>etc.</em>). It's commonly known as a "lifetime ban", but that's not strictly accurate, since the Commissioner can theoretically reinstate a person at his discretion. Many stints on the list only last a few years, and occasionally they are reinstated posthumously for Hall of Fame consideration.
<ul><li> "Shoeless" Joe Jackson is one of the most famous players on the list, for his involvement in the 1919 "Black Sox Scandal" when the Chicago White Sox <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingTheFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingTheFight">threw the World Series</a>. Jackson died in 1951, but he still cannot be enshrined in the Hall of Fame because of the ban, despite his talent. Some people believe he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">Mis-blamed</a> for his role in the scandal (one of whom is the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FieldOfDreams">Field of Dreams</a></em>).
</li><li> Pete Rose is baseball's all-time hits leader, but he has been banned for betting on baseball games while he was a player-manager for the Cincinnati Reds. He even bet on games he was involved in, although he maintains he never bet <em>against</em> the Reds (and the 1989 Dowd Report seems to back him up on that), but the rule makes no distinction on those lines.
</li></ul></li><li> British newspaper <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">The Sun</a></em> is, for all intents and purposes, banned from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FootballPopMusicAndFlatCaps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FootballPopMusicAndFlatCaps">city of Liverpool</a> after the paper published a blatantly false story accusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans">Liverpool FC fans</a> of starting the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and attacking victims and urinating on responding police officers (when it was really a fatal crush caused by abysmal crowd control). Liverpudlians responded by collecting all copies of <em>The Sun</em> they could find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">for bonfires</a>. When an inquest in 2017 officially cleared the victims of wrongdoing, the club itself banned <em>Sun</em> journalists from club premises. Liverpool's bitter crosstown rivals Everton FC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalsTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalsTeamUp">followed through with their own ban</a> (although the <em>Sun</em> hasn't been kind to that club either). To this day, it is pretty much impossible to buy a copy of <em>The Sun</em> in Merseyside.
</li><li> Four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">Tottenham Hotspur</a> fans were banned from all football grounds in England and Wales for three years in 2009 for chanting extremely offensive chants towards former Spurs player Sol Campbell, who famously left the North London club to join hated rivals Arsenal in 2001.
</li><li> The Northern Ireland-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Ice Hockey</a> team the Belfast Giants managed to do this to their owner. A month after buying a majority share, it was discovered that he was a registered sex offender in Florida charged with lewd and lascivious battery. The entire team cancelled their contracts with the club, and the trust who managed their home arena banned the team until the owner sold his share.
</li><li> Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was banned for life by USA Swimming, which ended his aspirations of swimming for the US Olympic team. This arose out of a considerably controversial case where he raped a drugged woman and got a lenient six-month sentence in prison, which was further reduced because the judge feared damage to his future swimming career. The public called for the judge's sacking for essentially showing favoritism to a white male frat-bro with a rich dad; without the backlash, it's unknown how USA Swimming would have reacted, and indeed, the judge in question (Aaron Persky) was recalled from the bench in 2018.
</li><li> Following a doping scandal, Marion Jones was <em>literally</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">Banned In China</a>&mdash;as in, she was barred from setting foot anywhere in an Olympic facility in 2008. The IOC even declared she wouldn't even be allowed access as a <em>spectator</em>.
</li><li> Four Chicago Blackhawks fans received lifetime bans from the United Center for chanting "basketball" at Washington Capitals player Devante Smith-Pelly (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">implication</a> being that Smith-Pelly, one of the few black players in the NHL, was playing the "wrong" sport for someone of his skin color). Smith-Pelly would prove himself a worthy hockey player by scoring seven goals in the 2018 playoffs, including a crucial game-tying goal in the game that would clinch the Caps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStanleyCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheStanleyCup">The Stanley Cup</a> for the first time in their history.
</li><li> As portrayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ITonya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ITonya">I, Tonya</a></em>, in the wake of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonya_Harding#Attack_on_Nancy_Kerrigan_and_aftermath">attack on Nancy Kerrigan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by people related to her (which she may or may not have known of), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyaHarding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyaHarding">Tonya Harding</a> was stripped of her titles and banned from competitive figure skating for life.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Other</span>
</p><ul><li> Fred Phelps, the late leader of Westboro Baptist Church, was banned from several places, most notably the UK. Ironically enough, he changed his ways and was excommunicated from his own church.
</li><li> For several years in the late 1980s, a US <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoastGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CoastGuard">Coast Guard</a> cutter which shall remain nameless was banned from the port of Juneau, Alaska, until the crew (due to the usual billet changes and rotations) was almost entirely replaced. Upon its eventual return, Leslie Fish's filk song made the rounds of the enlisted decks.
</li><li> This is quite frequently the fate of anybody caught counting cards at a casino blackjack table. Las Vegas casinos employ private investigators who maintain a list of people who have been caught trying to cheat (or even suspected of doing so) and routinely ban them from their premises, even if methods like <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting">card counting<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> aren't illegal &mdash; banning people from the premise for any reason other than discrimination based on the protected classes of race, gender, etc. is also legal, making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Man</a></em> a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Hollywood</a>. Notably, every known member of the famous MIT Blackjack Team is banned for life from most (if not all) casinos in the US, including every casino on the Las Vegas Strip; Vegas casinos have gone farther and banned <em>everyone who appears in an MIT yearbook</em>.. More amusingly, World Memory Champion Dominic O'Brien was banned from every casino in the UK just for his <em>ability</em> to count cards. (By contrast, casinos in Atlantic City can't ban card counters due to a 1979 state Supreme Court decision, so they have to use other means to thwart the practice such as using multiple decks and employing automatic shufflers.)
</li><li> Terry Jones, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">American fundamentalist pastor who holds Koran burnings</a>, was banned in the UK for possible incitement of violence.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5n5xm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5n5xm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5n5xm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a>'s Terry Jones, whom the UK couldn't ban if they wanted to as he's a British citizen.</span>
</li><li> Kurt Waldheim was secretary general of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations">United Nations</a> and then president of Austria. He was also maybe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziGrandpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziGrandpa">former Nazi intelligence officer</a>. The controversy got so bad that by the time he was president of Austria, he was not allowed to enter the United States and several European countries. Nobody ever found conclusive proof (and at least one author claimed he was framed by Mossad), so Waldheim was never prosecuted.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the Allies tried to quarter ANZAC troops in Cairo. The Egyptian government refused, saying that while New Zealanders were welcome, the city was still recovering from the victory celebration the Australian troops gave in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the last world war</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Athens</a> had a procedure known as <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism">ostracism<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, in which people would hold a vote on whoever was seen as the worst threat to society. The selected citizen would then be banished from Athens for a period of ten years. Notably, the penalty did not include confiscation of property or any other loss of status; very often, the ostracized citizen was actually very well-respected, but had gotten into some kind of fight with another well-respected major figure, threatening the stability of the city, and thus one or the other had to go to keep the peace.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> pissed off the nation of Colombia due to his actions concerning the construction of the Panama Canal. When asked why he had left it off his speaking tour of South America, he mentioned that he was "not a <em>persona grata</em>" in that country.
</li><li> The government of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Azerbaijan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> has compiled a blacklist of people, mainly foreign politicians, ambassadors, and even famous entertainers, who are no longer allowed entry into the country because they visited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NagornoKarabakh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NagornoKarabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, a breakaway, <em>de facto</em> country that seceded from Azerbaijan with the fall of the Soviet Union, but that Azerbaijan still claims as theirs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, French <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">war hero</a> and president of the post-war Republic, was basically made <em>persona non grata</em> in Canada after shouting "<em>Vive le Qu&eacute;bec libre</em>" ("Long live free Quebec!") in a speech to Canadians at the 1967 World's Fair during the country's 100th anniversary. While he wasn't officially banned, the controversy that resulted made him cut his visit short, and he never returned to Canada. (He only lived three years afterwards and he was already 77 years old.) Also interesting in that not only was his speech vehemently criticized in Canada (for obvious reasons) and America (who naturally backed up their northern neighbour and closest ally), but also <em>in France</em>, where it was seen as a serious breach of protocol.
</li><li> Roosh "The Douche" Vash is banned from the UK for publishing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">a satirical article advocating the decriminalization of sexual assault,</a> inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal">A Modest Proposal</a></em>.
</li><li> Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheMafia">the American mafia</a> usually kills troublemakers in gruesome ways, on occasions, an offender may be "given a pass," meaning they were spared, especially if they earned good or were old-timers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">But then</a>, the offender is permanently banned from associating or doing business with any made member under pain of death. In other words, they were "chased" and stripped of their "button"/membership within La Cosa Nostra.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://kiwifarms.net/threads/leonard-f-shaner-jr.9940/">Len Shaner<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is banned from pretty much every location in Kutztown, PA, due to constant trespassing on numerous railroads. Even to this day, it isn't entirely clear what earned him the ban.
</li><li> After the announcement of the death of U.S. Senator John McCain in 2018, it was announced that President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> would be banned from attending his funeral, due to Trump attacking his service during the 2016 election season, specifically mocking his time as a POW by saying "I like people who weren't captured." McCain's former 2008 running mate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SarahPalin">Sarah Palin</a> was also excluded from the funeral, along with former 2008 campaign advisors Steve Schmidt and Nicholle Wallace.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61aqq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note61aqq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61aqq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The latter two, supposedly, for their involvement in the source material for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GameChange">Game Change</a>, which John McCain hated.</span>
</li><li> When a spy given No Official Cover is caught, he or she can expect very serious consequences including execution or very long prison sentences. However, a spy who has an official diplomatic cover, cannot be prosecuted due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImmunity">Diplomatic Immunity</a>. They are therefore declared PNG, deported and banned from that country for life.
</li><li> Following numerous defamation cases from families of mass shooting victims and complaints from concerned groups, radio host and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">conspiracy theorist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PermanentRedLinkClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/PermanentRedLinkClub">Alex Jones</a> was permanently banished from mainstream social media outlets and websites such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Apple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Apple">Apple</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, Spotify, Periscope, Roku and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a>, largely for promoting hate speech and inciting violence against people of other faiths and ethnicities. PayPal followed suit, and the official InfoWars mobile apps were removed from the Apple App Store; the Android client remained on the Google Play Store for a time until it was finally taken down by Google on March 2020 due to misinformation circulated by Jones relating to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19">COVID-19</a> pandemic.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/russian-sanctions-against-canadians-a-badge-of-honour-1.2584137">Thirteen Canadians<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, including eight members of Parliament, were barred from Russia in 2014 for their condemnation of that country's invasion of Crimea. Several of them took it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">"a badge of honour"</a>, including three MPs of Ukrainian descent and one who had been expelled from the Soviet Union in 1979.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlecBaldwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlecBaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> was banned from the Phillipines and given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedDeathThreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedDeathThreat">Implied Death Threat</a> after making a joke on TV about a Filipino mail-order bride. The practice of mail-order brides is banned there, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">it makes sense</a>.
</li><li> After the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenYearsInTibet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenYearsInTibet">Seven Years in Tibet</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidThewlis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidThewlis">David Thewlis</a> and director Jean-Jacques Annaud were banned from entering China. The film itself was also banned due to its positive depiction of the Dalai Lama, as well as showing China's annexation of Tibet. Annaud was eventually allowed back in to judge the 2012 Shanghai Film Festival. Pitt's ban was also lifted sometime after, as he has since visited the country with his then wife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a> in 2014 and 2016.
