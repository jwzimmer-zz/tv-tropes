(Some of the oldest aspects of zombie appearance are actually symptoms of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin#Tetrodotoxin_poisoning">tetrodotoxin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> poisoning, a neurotoxin that may have been used in certain voudon rituals, though the Other Wiki dismisses the possibility on the grounds of not enough similarities between the two.) In this form, it has been known in America since the late 19th century. However, it wasn't until the 1960s that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero">George A. Romero</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">Night of the Living Dead (1968)</a></em> attached the word to the living dead who eat the flesh of the living. (Note, however, that the flesh-eaters in that movie are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">never referred to as "zombies,"</a> and Romero himself didn't consider them zombies, preferring "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">ghouls</a>.")

Most zombie invasion stories, even those not explicitly based on Romero's films, follow the same conventions, though there are major points of contention. While Romero is responsible for most of the "general" zombie conventions, the more specific and visible zombie tropes are more often inspired by the later works of John Russo, <em>Night</em>'s co-writer. Most zombie movies mix-and-match conventions from the Romero and Russo canons. The Russo canon in particular (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheLivingDead">Return of the Living Dead</a></em>) is the reason most people will respond with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood">Braaaiinnnns</a>" when zombies come up in conversation, and most depictions along those lines are references to it. Zombie canon was turned on its head with the release of the video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead">House of the Dead</a></em> in 1996 and the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater">28 Days Later</a></em> in 2002, which heavily influenced and popularized the modern trend of super-fast, super-angry zombies (usually infected sort-of-alive humans as opposed to the reanimated dead) that has carried over to numerous works of fiction and entertainment.

<ul><li> The zombies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ApocalypseNoToride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ApocalypseNoToride">Apocalypse no Toride</a></em> are diverse. Some are your typical plague, flesh-eating zombies, while others morph into strange-looking creatures with almost super human abilities. And let's not forget the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen">Hive Queen</a>.
</li><li> The Titans from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> are not undead, but bear some of the characteristics of zombies. They are mindless beings that relentlessly seek to devour humans, can only be killed by a targeted attack to a specific area, and do not experience pain. Their appetite is exclusively for humans, and make no effort to eat or otherwise harm animals, but despite walls being built to keep the humans and titans separate for decades, the titan population doesn't seem to have decreased at all, indicating they don't <em>need</em> to eat humans to survive. In season two, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when a horde of titans appeared <em>inside</em> the human territory without the walls being breached, it's implied that these titans used to be the people from Connie's village, and someone (commonly thought to be the Beast Titan) transformed them.</span>
</li><li> The abyss feeders from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>. A new class of "warriors" made by the Organization, they are created from the flesh of Awakened Beings instead of regular yoma. Unlike their Claymore counterparts, who retain their humanity in spite of being half monster, abyss feeders have no sense of self or humanity, and are only driven by the desire to eat the flesh of Abyssal Ones, by which they relentlessly track their target by being given a piece of their flesh. What makes them more zombie-like is their lanky and ungainly gait, eyes that are sewn shut, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">rapid regeneration</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthStitchedShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MouthStitchedShut">sewn-together mouths</a> that only become unfastened when they are eating their target <em>alive</em>.

While zombies are created by a virus that's spread by being bitten, it's said to be extremely weak: a healthy human won't even get sick before their body fights off the infection, they must be close to death already before the zombie virus can transform them. All zombies retain their human intellect provided that their brains are kept from decaying, and failing to makes them stupid but relaxed and easygoing, not feral monsters.

The main protagonist wants to join in a Zombie Expedition to help clear out some zombies and make the world safer, and even possibly track down the source of the problem.
</li><li> The second OVA of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> features a student whose Quirk is called, appropiately enough, "Zombie".

To begin with, it forces the soul of a dead person who has passed to the "Pure World" (the afterlife) back into the "Impure World" (the mortal world) to obey their summoner, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie">Voodoo Zombies</a>. At the same time, the jutsu actually works by using a living human as a basis onto which the appearance, memories, personality, and abilities of the deceased are grafted, hence them also being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie">Artificial Zombies</a>. The culmination of the jutsu implements a seal that overrides their free will completely and compels them to pursue a single goal relentlessly, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenant">Revenant</a>. To resurrect somebody as a zombie requires both a sample of their DNA and access to their soul, meaning that those whose souls are eaten by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a> cannot be resurrected.
<ul><li> The Mind Control is provided by a separate technique that is not required to bring them back to life, they would just make bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> without it. The resurrected can ignore the control with enough willpower.
</li><li> The only way to "kill" these zombies is to cancel the jutsu. Killing the person who performed the jutsu does <em>not</em> cancel it, it simply leaves the zombies to their own devices. And if one of the zombies knows how to perform the jutsu himself, he can free himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">while remaining an unkillable juggernaut with infinite stamina</a>. The zombie who does exactly that? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Madara Uchiha</strong>.</span>
</li><li> The Six Paths of Pain could also count as Artificial Zombies; they are corpses that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Nagato</a> can control through the Chakra Receiver Rods implanted all over their bodies.

Their bite also does not contain any means of making new zombies, but instead acts as a poison, numbing pain in small amounts or paralyzing in large amounts, making their victims unable to escape.
</li><li> The zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive">School-Live!</a></em> first appear like any other zombie but it's later seen that they possess residual memories to the point they seem to repeat habits they did when they were alive, such as former adults being at "work" and former students being in "school". In the anime, they are fairly content to leave the girls alone as long as they aren't startled and in general, seem to act like people in a constant psychotic daze. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After being bitten, Megu-nee was able to regain part of her memories and tried to hide herself away from the girls so she wouldn't hurt them.</span>
</li><li> When people die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SundayWithoutGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SundayWithoutGod">Sunday Without God</a></em>, nothing really changes except the fact that they decay. They're still like normal humans, only they don't age or need to eat or sleep, and the only way they can truly die is if they're properly buried by a certain kind of gravekeeper.
</li><li> The titular characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombieLandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombieLandSaga">Zombie Land Saga</a></em> are standard shambling corpses... until they are properly stimulated, whereupon they regain the memory and intelligence of their past lives.

On that note, the various girls post-zombification have been run over, shot through the chest, fallen from great heights, been hit by bolts of lightning, even being caught in a motorcycle explosion, and walked out admitting they felt pain and occasionally losing an easily-reattachable limb, but not much else.

He doesn't particularly like eating brains (prefers a pint of lager instead) and generally finds himself cleaning up the magical issues of pretty much everyone. While he can switch between corpses, he has a preferred body which most people seem to recognize. It's also preferred because he is psychically linked, meaning he feels whatever the body is subjected to (although not pain, otherwise he would be comatose from shock). Note that the corpse is nothing but an empty vessel for Wormwood, which means the parasite IS the revenant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is played with to good effect when Wormwood leaves his corpse in the first full story to find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.

They're flesh-eating because they eat human flesh, but are "other" since they're the result of a toxic food additive which causes insanity and sepsis rather than a virus or plague (making the title "<em>Year of Infection</em>" somewhat inaccurate). Where they're plague-bearing is the fact that the toxin can be transmitted through saliva via a bite. This also begs the question of whether or not they're actually undead or just insane, crazy rotting cannibals.
</li><li> The zombies in the <em>ZMD</em> (from the mind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinGrevioux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinGrevioux">Kevin Grevioux</a>, the guy behind the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld">Underworld</a></em> movies) comics are a mix of flesh-eating and plague-bearing. However, they were specifically designed by the US government to be deployed in conflict areas instead of living troops. In order to contain the threat, a build-in fail-safe causes them to sublimate when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">exposed to the sun</a> (which means they also get a vampire trait). They are exceptionally strong, able to literally tear body parts off their victims or punch through someone's ribcage. The problem appears when one of the prototypes goes missing following a deployment in the Middle East. Apparently, the zombie experiences <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailsafeFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailsafeFailure">Failsafe Failure</a> and is able to walk in the sun. The scientist in charge of the project is very concerned, fearing the zombie virus could mutate into an airborne form. They send the protagonist, a veteran soldier named Drake to find and destroy the runaway zombie, who is terrorizing towns in the Middle East, creating an army of zombies. Additionally, it turns out that the zombie virus works on other species too. At least two animal species are found infected: dogs and camel spiders. There is a cure of sorts, but it has to be injected within the hour of exposure, or the infection is irreversible. All zombies rot very quickly. Additionally, any zombie resulting from the bite of the mutated zombie is immune to sunlight.
<ul><li> It's also revealed that not all zombies are mindless creatures. The runaway prototype is capable of speech and exerts some sort of control over the others.

This urge can be negated if they are fitted with a special control collar, which allows them to be sold as domestic servants. They also show an ability to learn and even to regard some humans as non-food friends regardless of whether they are collared. One important difference from Romero zombies is that their bites are not invariably fatal, as one very much alive character sports a bite scar from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromantic">girlfriend</a>.

The first zombies, that of the unnamed protagonist band, are revenants, as their first act is to get revenge against those who killed them, then they go to a scheduled concert and rock out. Those who they kill, however, also rise as zombies and kill others, who continue the process. Given the origins of the zombies, they could arguably be voodoo (the "curse," in this case, being the music), as there is no mention of a plague and those killed rise as zombies no matter what methods are used to kill them. Some are flesh-eating zombies, and one little mutant midget zombie actually <em>eats himself from the feet up.</em>

</li><li> The French film "Les Revenants" or "They Came Back" deals with zombies that despite being dead within a 10 year range on some, have not decayed, do not crave human flesh and brains. They just one day walked calmly out of their cemetery as if they had been in a long sleep. However, they are sluggish and actually no longer live in our "reality". They have what is termed an "Echo and Memory" reality (echoing what seems like normal behavior and recalling how they might've been in their daily lives). They do tend to group together and migrate throughout the town. It is never explained why they rose and where/why they went when they decided to leave. The film focuses more on how the living's psyche would react when their loved ones rose than what the zombies are up to.
</li><li> The zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lifeforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Lifeforce">Lifeforce</a></em> are the result of a space vampire sucking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">life force</a> of a human victim, leaving a shriveled husk behind. The husk will try to suck the life force on humans as soon as possible, spreading the curse, otherwise it will explode into dust after two hours (a limitation that the vampires themselves do not have).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MomAndDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MomAndDad">Mom and Dad</a></em>, people are driven to relentlessly attack and kill their own biological offspring, but only them. They are capable of formulating plans and setting traps in order to do so, but always seem to wind up just flailing at them and savaging them like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">Hate Plague</a> zombies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonsterBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonsterBrawl">Monster Brawl</a></em>: These can be brought back by either military science or a supernatural curse. Either way, they're ravenous beasts who care only for feeding their hunger, and have to be chained up to prevent unnecessary attacks. When they die, their distress summons any undead in the area to avenge them.
</li><li> In the B-Movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBoyfriendsBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBoyfriendsBack">My Boyfriend's Back</a></em>, the protagonist is a revenant and flesh-eating. Revenant in that he comes back to life to take his beloved to prom after she says yes in his dying wish. Flesh-eating in that, to prevent rotting, he has to eat human flesh.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaziOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaziOverlord">Nazi Overlord</a></em>: These are made with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague">Synthetic Plague</a> that drives them into such an insane hunger that they have a compulsion to eat people. Other symptoms of the plague include shambling, groaning and incredibly pale skin.
</li><li> The zombies in <em>Nightmare City</em> take the cake as far as being nebulously-defined. They run around like humans and kill other humans with guns, knives and whatever they've got available, yet despite being intelligent, they never speak. They do consume human flesh and blood, but seemingly as an afterthought. Some of them have more caked oatmeal on their faces than others; some seem almost normal. How new zombies are made is totally unexplained, and whether or not headshots are needed to kill them differs from scene to scene.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Overlord2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Overlord2018">Overlord (2018)</a></em>: The experimented are explicitly stated to have been deceased brought back to life by Schmidt's serum, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a> with healing factors, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, and gruesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>. Some of the experiments seen near the end of the film, while not that mutated, noticeably wander like traditional zombies. The serum itself isn't communicable through bites, and instead is derived from an unknown black tar that has been processed through the blood of the "volunteers". They are also <em>not</em> put down for good by shooting them in the head, requiring significantly more punishment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnStrangerTides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnStrangerTides">Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</a></em>, Blackbeard's officers are the Voodoo type; mindlessly obedient to their 'creator', with no interest in eating anyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em>: These are corpses made into murderous automatons by alien science. They have no intelligence, not even to differentiate friend from foe, and just attack everything they see. However, they can be turned off with special guns.

At the beginning, the zombies are all traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieGait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieGait">Romero zombies</a> and are created either by a particular ritual or by biting living humans. Later in the film, they start sprinting and Angus, the main villain, starts summoning zombies from their graves. During the film, they frequently survive horrendous injury and other times, they can be killed just like any human by enough trauma. The wrestlers turned zombie seem to operate more intelligently in general, still busting out their trademark moves and seemingly being able to comprehend more complex maneuvers to go after their prey than simply shambling towards them and waiting for them to fall when climbing.
</li><li> The zombies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/REC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/REC">[REC]</a></em> are infected by a virus made by Satan.

Their mobility seems to depend on how advanced their decomposition is, but unlike many other examples retain much of the critical thinking and problem solving skills they had in life.

</li><li> Amando de Ossorio's movie <em>Tombs of the Blind Dead</em> (1971) has zombies that are the corpses of the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knights Templar</a> who return as the result of an ancient curse combined with a young woman disturbing their land. Their motivation is the continuation of their rituals, giving them elements of voodoo and the revenant. They also drink human blood, giving them hints of the flesh-eating zombies. This movie also had three sequels by the same director, <em>Return of the Blind Dead</em> (1973), <em>The Ghost Galleon</em> (1974), and <em>Night of the Seagulls</em> (1975).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarmBodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarmBodies">Warm Bodies</a></em> has two types of zombies; Corpses and Skeletons, also known as Fleshies and Bonies. Corpses are fully sentient, but have such little control over their zombie instincts that they're really just Romero Zombies with an inner monologue. They can use tools, speak single words occasionally, and they're one of the few examples of zombies in fiction that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can be cured. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">love</a></span>. Boneys, on the other hand are simply super-zombies; despite having no skin and very little muscle remaining, they are fast, powerful, skinny zombies.

</li><li> Russian writer Andrei Kruz invented the All-in-One zombies. They start as classic slow zombies, rotting mindless flesh-eating husks, reanimated by <em>solanum</em>-like virus. After consuming some living flesh, they get faster and smarter, some even able to use simple weapons such as clubs and knives. The more living meat they eat, the more they mutate, eventualy becoming "supers" - fast and powerful monsters with enough regeneration capability to survive concentrated machinegun fire.

There are also a few varieties of Revenant; Shoe and Poons are fully conscious, although they have the problem that they now have to manually control all of their movements which takes time to relearn. There are also non-sentient ones that Shoe doesn't think should count as zombies at all, just "memories on legs" that hang around their crypts.
</li><li> In Colin Adams' <em>Zombies and Calculus</em>, the "zombies" are infected with a virus that destroys the higher brain centers. This means that a heart shot is as good as the head, and they can still die from blood loss (and presumably asphyxiation or starvation.) However, this does not explain why they would prey solely on uninfected humans, rather than catching animals or plundering supermarkets.
</li><li> The zombies in Seanan McGuire's short story "Gimme a Z!" are <em>usually</em> voodoo and flesh-eating, mindlessly following the commands of their creator and requiring meat (not necessarily human) to maintain their existence. The catch is that they must be raised for a specific purpose, and some character traits are so ingrained that raising a zombie to go against those traits creates a revenant that can potentially rebel against its creator. Since this story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">does not take itself remotely seriously</a>, this means that a cheerleader brought back to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill her former squadmates</span> instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills the person who brought her back</span> because of the sheer force of her school spirit.

Before realizing there's more than one, Garrett expects the first one to show itself will specifically target its murderer, suggesting that most draugs in his world are revenants instead.

A Hand is created by a necromancer who summons a minor (usually nonsentient) undead spirit to inhabit and animate a corpse; the resulting creature is completely under the necromancer's control and generally used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> or for manual labor. If the necromancer is killed or their control is otherwise interrupted, the Hand will begin to wander about aimlessly and will usually attack any living person it stumbles across (though it eats life energy, not flesh or brains). They can't create more of their kind without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">Greater Dead</a> to do it for them.
<ul><li> More powerful free-willed Dead also exist, which are usually closer to a revenant, though the purpose that drives them is a need to stay in the world of the living.

</li></ul></li><li> The flesh-eating undead (they regard "zombie" as a slur) in the <em>Resurgam</em> trilogy by Joan Francis Turner are a more sophisticated version of the standard flesh-eating zombie. They rot, and eat the flesh of humans and animals, but they are still sentient and have strong individual personalities, as well as quite a sophisticated culture. They also aren't infectious, but that rumour exists among living humans as an urban legend.

</li><li> The zombies in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> novels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathTroopers">Death Troopers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsRedHarvest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsRedHarvest">Red Harvest</a></em> are a peculiar combination of voodoo, flesh-eating, and plague-bearing. The Blackwing virus, as revealed in <em>Red Harvest</em>, was originally the product of Sith Alchemy (the Dark Side being pretty much the in-universe equivalent of black magic), specifically an immortality potion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Gone Horribly Wrong</a>&mdash; the Sith Lord who created it intended for its user to complete the ritual by devouring the heart of a Jedi with a high midichlorian count after infecting himself, but no one ever managed to get that far before becoming a zombie. The virus fell into obscurity for a few millennia, before being rediscovered by the Galactic Empire and reworked through scientific means into a biological weapon. It's primarily spread through bite wounds, and takes effect faster that way, but the Imperial version can also be refined into an airborne agent that takes longer to kick in, but transcends all biohazard containment barriers (except in the case of rare individuals who are immune to it; bites work the same even in their case). The undead themselves share a kind of group consciousness, and while they start out mindless and feral upon reanimation, seeking only to either eat or infect others, they eventually learn and adapt to such a degree that they can operate blasters, lightsabers, and even starfighters. When it comes to fighting them, the usual methods of decapitation and burning work best, while those reanimated by the airborne version have the unique weakness of only being able to operate in an environment that's thoroughly saturated with the plague agent, dropping dead as soon as they leave it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieSurvivalGuide">The Zombie Survival Guide</a></em> has mindless flesh-eating zombies that are produced as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> Solanum, which reanimates the brainstem as an oxygen-independent organ, allowing the zombie to continue to "live" so long as the brainstem is intact, even if they are decapitated. The oxygen-independent nature of the mutated brainstem also allows the zombie to survive in many hostile conditions, including underwater, for as long as their body remains intact until decomposition causes them to fall apart. The virus is spread through the transmission of bodily fluids, primarily through bites, but also through other means like contact with open wounds and sores, as well as, in theory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead">sexual contact</a> (although the book is quick to mention anyone willing to test this specific theory is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>). Some specifics of the virus and zombies, from their ability to sense prey even without functioning eyes or ears and their ability to discern human flesh from animal flesh, are left unknown.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheZombieKnight">The Zombie Knight</a></em> (and numerous other characters) are effectively zombified into Servants by spirit beings known as Reapers. This has none of the usual drawbacks, as Servants are basically just normal humans plus some superpowers. They retain their free will, although Reapers can "release" an uncooperative servant, and also gain super strength, regeneration, and some sort of unique superpower that grows in strength over time. Their brain is a weakness, but even when re-killed this way their Reaper can just regenerate them. Basically zombies are more in line with superhero/villains than traditional zombies.
<ul><li> The story does feature something refered to in universe as Zombies that is closer to traditional zombies. When a Reaper dies, their Servants body stays behind, losing it's soul and most of it's intelligence. These Zombies will attempt to kill humans to steal a soul to replace the now missing soul (which is not actually possible). They still maintin most of their previous strength, making them very dangerous to regular people although they can't harm Reapers.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTomeOfBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTomeOfBill">The Tome of Bill</a> zombies seem to be a mix of flesh eating and plague types.

</li><li> Zombies from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinJAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinJAnderson">Kevin J.

The latter may conform to the "revenant" type. Fully sentient creatures, this Verse's zombies may conform to the "flesh-eater" type also, but it's considered a tragic addiction rather than normal zombie behavior. It's mentioned that mad scientists and necromancers sometimes craft the "artificial" and "voodoo" variants, although the former aren't generally referred to as zombies.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheJerleShannara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheJerleShannara">The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara</a> we see a particularly terrifying version. Antrax creates zombies by turning captured humanoids into cyborgs literally trapped in their own bodies in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> situation. The true horror for the heroes comes not when they see their friends coming at them in chrome zombie chassis, but from looking into their eyes and realizing their friends are still very much aware of what's going on, and silently begging to be killed. Bonus points for going back to the original concept of the zombie as someone enslaved by an evil master, rather than as an epidemic infection.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">Technically Living Zombies</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackTideRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackTideRising">Black Tide Rising</a></em> series, created by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague">Synthetic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatePlague">Hate Plague</a>, do eat flesh like Romero zombies, but will turn on other zombies if no other food source presents itself, and can go into hibernation to conserve energy when food is unavailable.

Howard</a>'s short story "Pigeons From Hell", there's a creature called the <em>zuvembie</em>, which is a strange mix of Voodoo zombie (it's created through a combination of ritual and an applied potion), revenant (it has no master and is free-willed enough to kill for vengeance, or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>), and Technically Living (bullets will take it out). It also has some magical powers not associated with the usual zombie.
</li><li> Necromancers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> create zombies who act more like the Terminator than traditional zombies. They are fast, incredibly strong, and resilient to attacks that would destroy traditional zombies in seconds (To quote the main character: "What's the use of a foot soldier who can't do anything but hobble along and moan about brains?"). They also require the constant beating of a "drummer" (in some cases a literal drum, in some cases just another similar sound) to mimic a heart beat in order to stay animated. Of course they tend to operate in smaller numbers than standard zombies, as even a group of 3 or 4 zombies can be quite effective. They are also not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">limited to being humans.</a>
<ul><li> Despite the fact that animals can technically be zombified, a Necromancer can make zombies more powerful based on the "footprint" left by the corpse. Humans and older corpses in general have deeper (and thus more powerful) footprints, so the ones used by the necromancers in <em>Dead Beat</em> are usually a few centuries old. The laws of magic only specifically forbid using Humans as Zombies since usually animals don't have enough of an impression to be zombified at all, but a clever wizard realizes that a <em>sixty-five million</em> year old <em>T.rex</em> has power to spare and zombifying it is technically not breaking the law.

However people who live in the country around the city of Elantris just randomly become Elantrians, they don't breathe or have heartbeats, they have a constant ravenous hunger (for regular food, not brains or flesh), and they don't heal from their wounds at all and they are almost impossible to kill, beheading or burning being the only ways to kill them, though they usually go insane and catatonic from the pain of accumulated injuries within a year of becoming an Elantrian. Originally the transformation used to turn people into glowing silver, super powered, borderline divine beings, so a great deal of the novel deal with figuring out what went wrong. It turns out they are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> trapped in the middle of the magical transformation due to a flaw in the city of Elantris.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a></em> features two types.

They are generally beautiful, larger, stronger and faster than normal people, and require no sustenance other than one Breath per week, or they will die when their body automatically consumes their Divine Breath.

</li><li> In <em>Ashes</em> by Ilsa J. Bick, an electromagnetic pulse turned most teenagers into zombies instantly. This is different from most, because the zombies aren't dead, they seem to be extremely brain-damaged living people. They also cannot change you into a zombie through biting, instead their bite is like a regular person biting you.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the second book, it is revealed that some of the zombies are actually pretty intelligent, possibly because they are getting smarter.

They can even lust after each other. They seem to be just as smart as normal people, but are unable to speak, and have a taste for human flesh.</span>

It also plays with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFood">Brain Food</a> element a bit with a chapter introducing a zombie food pyramid - brains are an important part of the zombie diet, but are at the top of the pyramid, while more servings are needed of other food groups, being other organs, blood, and bone marrow.

They bury themselves during the day, and emerge at night to shamble around and tear apart anyone unlucky enough to get caught outdoor. However, they are not typical flesh-eating zombies, as they don't actually eat their victims, merely assault and kill them. They are created when dark magic is used to rip the spirit out of a person; but unlike voodoo zombies, they do not obey the one who created them.

They constantly hunger for more human flesh, and no matter how much they eat they constantly look emaciated. A bite from one of them spreads the Wendigo's curse, causing an infectee to become ravenously hungry until they ultimately die of starvation and rise as another screamer. They are also intelligent enough to use firearms and speak, and freakishly fast when they sprint at potential prey. The only known way to put them down individually is to destroy the brain, though re-imprisoning the Wendigo seems to cut off its influence and neutralize them as well.

Ten years later, there are 6 billion risen prowling the dead lands between major cities of the world. In fact, Africa and much of Asia are considered to be entirely dead. Some risen have managed to regain their sanity and become Quazi (note the "z"). Several surviving nations now have sizable Quazi populations with their own governments. In Russia, the Quazi capital is located in Saint Petersburg, where only about 12% of the population are living. Moscow is the Russian bastion of the living, with the Circle Road becoming a massive fortification against the undead and armored trains being used for transportation between surviving cities. The Quazi are several times stronger and faster than humans. They are extremely tough and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>.

Strangely, they are all vegetarians and tend to be unable to process food that hasn't been grown organically. It's later revealed that becoming a Quazi requires that a risen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eat a living brain</span>, which is something the Quazi keep hidden from the living to avoid any more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. The Quazi have bluish-gray skin and tend to be stuck at whatever mental state they were in during death. They try to wear the same clothes all the time, do the same job, read the same books, watch the same movies, listen to the same music, etc. They are unable to develop beyond that. They are almost completely lacking in emotions they don't remember from their living days. They come off as logical and unfeeling. No one knows why anyone dying becomes a risen in short order, as no virus, bacterium, or mutation have been found to account for that fact in the 10 years since the apocalypse. The novel's major plot turns out to be a race to find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">two viruses: one that kills all adult humans and one that kills all Quazi</span>.

Anyone who dies, regardless of the cause, will have their soul captured by the Underworld and become another zombie. These zombies can't be permanently killed, as their souls will return to their Underworld to be reused.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> book 3 showcases a non-infectious variety; a vampire casts a black magic spell that causes every dead body within miles of the protagonists to come after them with mindless hunger, until the object used as a focus is destroyed (in this case, the object turns out to be a person). The zombies are extremely fast and strong even by vampire standards, and they cannot be killed, though they don't heal and can be disabled by hacking them to pieces or burning them to ashes.

There is also another occasion where a magic mask made the dead in the area come back as zombies, all of whom wanted to get the mask and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">become the Voodoo god</a> it represented.

"The Pax" - Latin for "Peace"), administered through the air recycling systems. The chemical was designed to weed out aggression and anger. The ultimate result was that 99.9% of the population stopped going to work, talking to each other, and eventually stopped moving, eating or breeding, and therefore died. However, the remaining tenth of a percent of the population had the opposite reaction, with their aggression and primal instincts boosted beyond simple madness into murderous rage, sadism and xenophobia.

</li><li> The zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie">iZombie</a></em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">mostly alive</a>, since their condition is caused by an artificial virus (it's speculated that it's an experimental bioweapon) mixed into a supply of a new designer drug popular with the young crowd. The protagonist Liv still behaves like she's a normal living person with the exception that she has a hunger for human brains, which she satisfies by working at the medical examiner's office. Most of their taste receptors are dead, so the only thing they can taste are the brains (which they find a bit metallic) and extremely spicy food (hence Liv's liberal use of hot sauce). The "living" zombies look very pale and have white hair but don't exhibit any flesh decay. However, those who go without brains for a long time start to decay into the typical "shambling zombie". Unfortunately, if a zombie goes completely feral (usually after 5-6 months of not eating brains), then the condition is irreversible. Eating brains not only satisfies their craving and allows them to retain their higher brain functions but also temporarily grants the zombie some of the traits, skills, and memories of the deceased. Liv uses this ability to help a police detective investigate crimes, by passing off her "visions" (memory recalls triggered by certain cues) as psychic. When threatened, a zombie can temporarily go into a "full-on zombie mode" (or "rage out") and viciously fight off the attacker. A zombie's heartbeat is very slow (something like 10 beats per minute), which also meant that, if wounded, they don't bleed out. Their deadened nerves means they can undergo open heart surgery without anesthesia. The condition can be passed by fluid contact (including sex, but kissing appears to be okay) or a scratch.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>: Various fans like to draw parallels between Borg drones and zombies. They share similarities with plague-bearing/parasite, for their "nanoprobes" and ability to infect others, and artificial for their cybernetics grown into them by the nanoprobes or grafted on by other drones. While most zombies are played as "mindless" because they're undead, drones are claimed to be mindless because they don't think for themselves; they all share the same thoughts, and the same directive, mind control similar to voodoo. They're a near-endless horde bent on making everything in the universe just like them so that they can become "perfect." Get one drone alone, severed from the collective, and he'll either (depending on if he's damaged or not) start overcoming the mind control, making him his own person, or working by the most basic form of the general directive of the collective, which will make him very much more zombie-like. Scarier when a severed drone starts to exhibit both.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZNation">Z Nation</a></em> zombies are typical Romero zombies, but with some twists. They were created by a specially designed virus, they move slowly until he plot requires them to run, people say they eat brains but they seem to eat all parts of the body, getting bit by a zombie turns you into a zombie, the brain needs to be taken out to stop them, both humans and animals can turn into zombies, and sometimes it looks like anyone who dies turns into a zombie no matter what they die of. What probably makes these zombies especially dangerous is how quickly people turn into zombies, someone who is bitten will turn in a couple of seconds giving everyone else not a lot of time to react. And those are just normal zombies, this show goes crazy with zombie variations, like Radioactive Zombies, Plant Zombies, and even Alien Zombies (sort of).
<ul><li> The final season introduces Talkers, zombies who retain their minds and look perfectly human (if sickly) but are physically dead. And as long as they're fed a steady supply of brains (or, as it later turns out, lithium), they're able to stay in this state; if not, they devolve into regular zombies.

The line about "no more room in hell" isn't the explanation for the zombies; it comes from a former cop talking about something his Voudon-practicing grandmother used to say.

</li><li> The ancient Greeks had a plethora of names for the undead, stemming from the fact that ancient Greece was made up of various independent kingdoms. Among the many names of the undead was <em>kathakano</em>. These zombies were said to rise from the dead in order to feast on the living, with particular fondness for livers, putting them firmly in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleshEatingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleshEatingZombie">Flesh-Eating Zombie</a> category.

From all indications, the zombies normally retain their original personality and attributes, and don't even need to eat brains (if they don't want to, and provided the brains are organic). All the shambling, swaying, slow movements and groaning is because the zombies are so happy to be alive again they keep going out and getting really, really drunk.

</li><li> Flesh-Eating zombies appear in great amounts, with too many examples to count.
</li><li> On the city-world of Ravnica, zombies are considered completely normal citizens. Here, the walking dead serve in farms, charity services, and even the police force. The zombie policeman featured in the card Wight of Precinct Six is notable, whose flavor text reads "Even the lost and undead need a protector".

The Phyrexian oil also seems to work like a zombie plague, with one mere scratch transforming the victim into a mindlessly obedient Phyrexian.

Unusually, they are aligned with White mana.
</li><li> Another example of rather unique zombies from Amonkhet, are the eternals. They are Amonkhet's greatest warriors who were killed by one of their brainwashed gods and zombified by Nicol Bolas. They are coated with blue metal called lazotep, they are stronger than they were in life, as smart and have the same skills as before, and follow Bolas's command.
</li></ul></li><li> Although the standard animates of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnhallowedMetropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnhallowedMetropolis">Unhallowed Metropolis</a></em> are flesh-eating with some plague-bearing elements, the alchemically-created mercurials are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialZombie">Artificial Zombies</a> that, depending on how successful the procedure is, can vary from flesh-eating with plague-bearing elements, to pure flesh-eating, to multiple variations on the revenant. Even the most successful ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>, though.
<ul><li> The Hong Kong animates don't seem that weird in the overall zombie scheme of things from what information is available... but they somehow don't follow the rules that govern zombies in the setting. Animates decay and desiccate over time, eventually becoming mummified to the point of immobility before rotting away entirely. Plague Animates can stave this off by devouring living human flesh. The Hong Kong animates should have run out of living humans to prey on long ago, but somehow they're still functioning 200 years after the initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>.
</li><li> Weirder on a typical scale are zombie lords, animates that retain some degree of intelligence and possess an ability to draw other animates toward them and telepathically direct them. Any large, directed horde needs at least one of these at its head, and possibly multiple working in tandem, as they turn aimless zombies motivated primarily to find living humans and eat them into a coordinated attack force. If it's any consolation, they're <em>usually</em> not terribly bright &mdash; some intelligence is still lost, so a human of average intelligence becomes a zombie lord with below-human-average intelligence. Someone at the peak of human intelligence who becomes one, though, will still be able to outwit most humans even after the loss of intelligence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>: Depending on how you see it, a Genestealer cult could be this. They are unfathomably loyal to their Patriarchal Alien, are made by parasites, etc. One can argue that they're not true undead and are just mutants, but half this list can also argue that.
<ul><li> This comparison is most apt for the "Contagii", those who have had a Genestealer use its mouth... tentacle... thing to implant its genetic material into them. They are dazed by the experience and unable to remember the incident. While they unconsciously seek to spread their mutation by breeding they can be taken control of at any time by the Genestealer Patriarch in charge of the brood that infected them and used as mindless slaves. Beyond that they become an entirely separate breed of Xenos creature.
</li><li> There are also Plague Zombies, undead created by Nurgle's magical plagues. They're the pretty standard "Plague bearing, actually dead" type, but instead of biting people, just being within proximity of them can cause infection.
</li><li> Nurgle also has the Plaguebearers, lesser daemons created from the victims of his signature disease, Nurgle's Rot. Since it's magical/psychic in nature, it literally corrupts the soul and when the victim expires, they are reborn as a daemon within Nurgle's realm. Plaguebearers, naturally, have Nurgle's Rot and can spread it to others. They are technically not zombies, but a type of daemon, however they otherwise fit the bill.
</li><li> Finally, Nurgle's devoted Space Marine Legion, the Death Guards, have been transformed into what's known as Plague Marines; Space Marines so riddled with disease that even anti-tank rounds have a hard time to put them down, while at the same time they shamble on at a slow pace spreading the aforementioned Nurgle's Rot to everything they touch (as an added icing on the cake, many of them can summon Plaguebearers too). Unlike most examples, Plague Marines are fully sentient. They just hate non-nurglite life.
</li></ul></li><li> Several teams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em> can field zombies. They appear to be voodoo type zombies. They are slow, but high armor and intelligent enough to always play the game as your order them to (they don't have the Bonehead, Wild Animal, or Really Stupid traits). Nurgle teams can also field rotters, closer to plague zombies, which also are intelligent enough to play the game, have high armor for their cost, a bit faster, but get injured far easier. If a rotter or anyone else on a Nurgle team kills an enemy player, they become a Rotter.
</li><li> The zombies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> are quite unique creatures.

These creatures often look decayed, sometimes to the point of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">animated skeletons</a>, have at the least low-human level intelligence (they frequently wield guns and can potentially be crackshots), they don't need to eat but enjoy eating human flesh, and they can't spread in any reliable fashion.
<ul><li> The setting also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie">Voodoo Zombies</a>, which are created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Conjure</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">Doctors</a> by invoking Baron Samedi and so are short lived creatures (when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Bokor</a> uses the same prayer, the Rada loa create a Walkin' Dead instead), and Harrowed.

However, they still need to sleep a couple of hours a day (so the manitou can do "maintenance" and keep the body from rotting), during which time the manitou forces the soul to experience nightmares in an effort to size the body back, and they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that requires them to consume raw meat &mdash; and a supernatural hankering for human flesh is a Harrowed-specific disadvantage.

Not through a parasite, but some other kind of strange magic.

Fast zombies have become common in zombie movies and video games since the 2000s.
</li><li> There are zombies aplenty in different flavors in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> series, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> there is a special set of zombies. These three particular zombies are fought as a boss against Alucard by impersonating his three allies, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, and Grant Dynasty from the 3rd game, with their abilities to boot.
</li><li> There are two major types of undead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>:
<ul><li> One is the zombie. Zombies are simply walking corpses that do not feel pain or fear, and with body parts that can rot. They can be created in one of two ways:
<ul><li> Resurrected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">necromancers</a>, falling under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie">Voodoo Zombie</a> subtype, or
</li><li> Resurrected in certain haunted biomes. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ke6c');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ke6c" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ke6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This type can be especially dangerous, because as long as they are in the area they originated in, any limb or head that falls off has the potential of of becoming undead <em>itself</em>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The other is the husk, which is created when a living creature is covered in a certain type of cursed dust, with intense hatred for all life, and greater strength than they ever had in life. They can spread the dust to other creatures, which runs the possibility of quickly creating an unstoppable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>. And not only do they (unlike normal zombies) retain all the skills they had while they were alive, they retain the ability to <em>learn</em>, so their skills as a killing machine grow the more they kill.
</li></ul></li><li> The zombies of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series are flesh-eating, plague-bearing zombies who are also, to a certain extent, constructed. The zombies are the result of the T-virus, engineered by the evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Umbrella Corporation</a>, although the zombies are simply a by-product of the virus, which is designed to create more powerful and dangerous creatures to be used and sold as weapons.
<ul><li> Technically, the zombies of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 fall under the parasite classification. This is due to the fact that they are turned into what they are by the plagas parasite. In Resident Evil 5, it's actually an altered version of the parasite. A case could be made that the enemies of Resident Evil 4 also fall into the Voodoo category as they're controlled by the Big Bad of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The zombies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> are similar to those of <em>Resident Evil</em> (flesh-eating and plague-bearing) with a notable difference; the source of the zombie plague is an artificially mutated breed of wasp that carry the virus, which infects those it stings while implanting their brood in the host's body. The zombies have a strange reaction around queen wasps; when a queen is killed, the wasp larvae in surrounding zombies violently erupt from their hosts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">blowing their heads off</a> and killing them in a matter of seconds. These zombies also become more dangerous at night, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">glowing red eyes</a> and more aggressive behavior.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>: The parasitic Flood's standard method of infection is to have little green popcorn on legs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">burrow into your spine and override your neural pathways, and completely rewrite your genetic code, mutating your body into a tentacled, bulbous monster specifically designed to kill</a>. And when they die, they can still be revived if another Infection Form comes along and reanimates it. Also, when your mangled, mattered corpse has been damaged beyond use, it bloats and becomes a hive for more Infection Forms. The Flood can also use airborne spores to similar effect.
<ul><li> They also have some revenant elements to them, with infectees retaining some of their original abilities (which is why they can shoot, drive, and even pilot starships). Additionally, every Flood form is apparently a repository for the collective memories, knowledge, and intelligence of <em>every single sentient</em> the parasite as a whole have consumed; when an outbreak has reached a great enough level, they will form Graveminds, giant Flood biomasses that can access this hyper-intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> and telepathically control every Flood form within their range of influence (which can extend up to at least a <em>star system</em>). Once the Flood reach this point, they will go beyond simply infecting targets, and begin using their biomass as building blocks for even more dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleshGolem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleshGolem">Flesh Golems</a> designed by the collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> 3</em> are flesh eating (they consume both dead bodies and immobile zombies) but do not attempt to bite the player. They are not contagious, having being changed by spirits from hell, and go straight from alive to undead in most cases. Most civilian zombies are slow moving and have low intelligence, but military zombies are faster, more agile and smarter, utilizing pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, and basic squad tactics. They also have a vulnerability to wounds to the body. Finally, the brain is not a center of infection, even if headshots count for extra damage for zombies <em>that actually have heads</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Heretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Heretic">Heretic</a> 2</em> zombies are former townsfolk that have been driven mad, sickened or prone to violence by a magical plague, however it seems they cannot spread the disease, plague bringers are needed for this.

Well, not exactly, but half-way through the game, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Liquid represses the Mercenary Army's nanomachines, causing their emotion and reason to flood back into their brain</span>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a> in the area are brain damaged. Guess what? They shamble, moan, and are pretty much Classic-Romero zombies, to the point of mindlessly rushing Snake (and not reacting to any sort of stimuli). There's no biting or undead stuff, though.
</li><li> Zombies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em> are brain-damaged former stalkers who, while quite resistant to gun fire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">show no signs of actually being undead</a>. It's suggested that they just got too close to the 'Brain Scorcher' and lost their minds. They also know how to use guns (badly).
<ul><li> These aren't complete zombies in some instances. In <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</em>, they can be found muttering garbled words back and forth, and will move their arms towards barrel fires. They even loot corpses and replace their weapons with better ones.
</li></ul></li><li> Cie'th from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> are l'Cie that have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">failed their given Focus</a> and transformed into crystal-ridden warped monsters. They have such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">heartwarming names</a> as "Ghoul" and "Ghast". And they eventually degrade into immobile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue">Living Statues</a> called Cie'th Stones -that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">still suffering.</a> Even worse, a person's mental state can hasten the process, resulting in some less stoic l'Cie turning into Cie'th almost immediately after getting their Focus.
<ul><li> The alternative isn't much better. When a l'Cie completes their Focus, their body is instantly transformed into a human-shaped crystal. It's little wonder that the humans in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> world consider becoming a l'Cie to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> (so much so that killing someone who had the misfortune of becoming a l'Cie is treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>).
</li><li> Even worse, the fal'Cie have figured out how to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">exploit a certain loophole</a>; if a fal'Cie creates a l'Cie without a Focus, the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> creates an <em>instant</em> Cie'th. This effectively means that if the fal'Cie need an undead army on the spot and you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - enjoy your eternal suffering as a shambling monster without any input or means of preventing it whatsoever!
</li></ul></li><li> Zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> are created by piecing together dead body parts, and in later games they are fully healed when they kill an opponent, though they have no attacks that specifically eat flesh. Instead, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot">puke at foes,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack">turn themselves into tornadoes,</a> and inexplicably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerAttack">create at least twenty copies of themselves and consecutively body-slam the enemy</a> for their standard attacks. They also have <em>mohawks</em> and hunger for brains. Of note, they are stated to be dead <em>monsters,</em> not human(oids), though they seem to pieced together out of human's dead body parts. The game isn't too clear on the issue.
<ul><li> Interestingly, according to supplementary material, these zombies are stated to be corpses revived by the Netherworld's natural miasma.
</li><li> Other than their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> in <em>Hour Of Darkness,</em> Zombies in later games are all shown to be every bit as sentient as other Netherworld denizens; being capable of speech, fairly intelligent and have the potential to rival <em>an Overlord in power</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Yoshika Miyako from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Ten Desires</a></em> is that while she <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jiangshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jiangshi">Jiangshi</a>, she is better described as a zombie with a funny-looking sticky note on the forehead. She was resurrected to guard the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">mausoleum of Toyosatomimi no Miko</a>, she cannot feel pain, is stiff from <em>rigor mortis</em>, is barely smarter than a brick and can temporarily turn someone into a zombie. Part of this is because in the "outside world" (a.k.a. the real world), Jiangshi aren't talked of much but zombies are becoming popular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">which affects things in Gensokyo</a>.

</li><li> Ghouls from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> universe are ordinary humans exposed to massive amounts of heat and radiation but somehow surviving. Ghouls differ from most zombies due to not strictly speaking being 'undead' in any way - there is never a point in the life of a ghoul where they are dead and then alive again. Ghouls do however physically resemble zombies, and 'zombie' is considered a racial slur against them. Ghouls are infertile and seem to live forever unless killed. About half the ghouls in the Capital Wasteland and surrounding areas have completely retained their memories and personalities, but have some memory problems due to most of them being hundreds of years old. Other, 'feral' ghouls have become mindless killing machines that attack any human that comes near them. Attitudes towards ghouls differ - the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Brotherhood of Steel</a> kill them on sight and many humans treat them with fear and disgust. Others, such as Three Dog and the citizens of Megaton understand that the difference between them and humans is largely cosmetic.
<ul><li> Expansions such as The Pitt feature other flesh-eating, decaying-looking formerly-human radiation monsters, such as Trogs, who are always mindless flesh-eaters and walk on all fours, and Wildmen, who seem to retain some human characteristics but eat people and cannot be talked to or reasoned with.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> add-on <em>Dead Money</em> introduces the Ghost People, hazmat suit wearing former construction workers of the Sierra Madre Villa.

</li><li> <strong>Old World Blues</strong> has the lobotomites, which are humans who have several of their vital organs, specifically their brains, removed and replaced with cyborganic technology. They can use guns, but they don't seem to have any sense of self preservation and are instantly hostile to any and all non lobotomites.
</li><li> Then came the Marked Men from <em>Lonesome Road</em>. They are former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> of the NCR and the Legion that were caught in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Divide</a>, and a combination of hazards such as the unique wind storms and radiation caused most of their weskin to be torn off, with only the Divide's radiation keeping them alive. They have no little sense of who they once were, and now just kill anything they see. Despite this, they still hunt, cut their food, use guns, and at least have some sense of self preservation, as shown in an ending where they allow the Courier passage out of the Divide out of fear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout76" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout76">Fallout 76</a></em> has the Scorched, victims of a dangerous plague that eventually leaves its those infected as little more than irradiated ultracite statues. Until then, however, the Scorched are essentially akin to semi-feral ghouls, mindlessly attacking any non-Scorched while possessing enough intelligence to use weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> Zombies in <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy">Meat Boy</a></em> are corpses of a dead Meat Boy. Meat Boy respawns as normal when he dies, but his former dead body is resurrected as zombie, potentially making the amount of zombies infinite. Those zombies tend to hang around Hell and Rapture and are also capable of fusing together into a larger creature.
</li><li> The Undead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> start off as living humans marked with the "Darksign," a black spot ringed with fire on their bodies. These include almost every human character in the game, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>. Upon death, they turn into something akin to a revenant &mdash; a near-mummified corpse still retaining its human mind and intelligence. Over time or as they die more, they eventually lose all of their humanity and become Hollow &mdash; monstrous killing machines that, although not utterly mindless, don't seem to be capable of anything more thoughtful than wielding weapons and trying to kill all who cross their path. It <em>is</em> possible for them to regain their humanity and the appearance of life, but it's not an easy process &mdash; methods include reclaiming humanity from corpses (slow, but comparatively safe), helping other Undead with their trials, or attacking other Undead to steal humanity from them. And it's not permanent, either; as soon as the Undead dies again, they go right back to near-Hollow state.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> introduces the Unkindled, a new subrace of undead who tried and failed to link the fire and become a Lord of Cinder. They (like the protagonist) are resurrected when the bell of Firelink Shrine tolls and are tasked with finding the Lords of Cinder and bringing them back to Firelink Shrine to sit in their thrones and help rekindle the first flame. They do not seem to possess the darksign like regular undead as they do not hollow when they die, but they can hollow when marked with the darksigil. Unkindled have a burnt motif to their designs, their clothes flacking with ash as their clothes glow like burnt leaves, lose this burnt motif if they die and can regain it (and their maximum health) using an Ember.
</li><li> A deeper look at the cosmology of the series reveals that The Undead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are not truly zombies at all. They are in fact the primordial state of humanity prior to the discovery of the First Flame that introduced disparity to the world such as life and death. It was the Lord Souls that granted humans true life (and with it true death). Hollowing is simply humans reverting to their original state as beings who neither lived nor died, but simply existed.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly in the earlier game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>, the Dregling is a human that has gone mad after having their soul devoured by the demons in the fog. Some Dreglings have some humanity left in them and can talk and trade with the player, others are completely hostile such as the slaves and former soldiers of the Boletarian palace.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Siren">Siren</a></em> has people known as "Shibito". Shibito have all the standard setup of a zombie-like entity, but are not technically dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they are controlled by the alien god Datatsushi to eventually turn the world into a hellish realm for him to live.</span> The Shibito cannot die, they can be harmed but can heal very quickly, their bodies can mutate and become bug like or grow an excessive number of eyes, they lash out at anything not infected, they are hive minded, they use firearms, they plan and think, and they wander about pointlessly looking for people not under the control. How one becomes a Shibito is vague at best, as multiple individuals that fit the criteria for a Shibito are not Shibito during any part of the game, while other people who have nothing to do with the town become Shibito towards the end.
</li><li> The Zerg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> are just as zombie like as the Borg, but purely biological. If you infest a Terran command post, you can even create Infested Terrans to suicide bomb your enemies.
</li><li> Ms. Fortune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em> the only thing keeping her alive is the life gem she swallowed; without it, she'd die.
<ul><li> Squigly from the same game is an even better example, being a 14-years-dead corpse resurrected to serve as one of the Skullgirl's mindless minions. Only the presence of her parasite Leviathan allows her to retain her memories and free will.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand">Super Mario Land</a></em> has an enemy that is based on the Chinese mythology of zombies. Mario can stomp on them all he likes, but the monster will keep reviving itself. Only the Super Ball power up can truly kill them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand">Wario Land</a></em> series, Wario can end up becoming one if he gets attacked by a zombie or ghost. While he moves more slowly than usual, he can get past one-way platforms by jumping and decomposing, letting his hat fall through and recomposing afterwards. Cures for this state of undeath are usually exposure to light and water.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny">Sonny</a></em> has the main character (who is named Sonny), who is technically undead, but aside from that is nothing like conventional zombies. He's capable of thinking, talking, and other stuff an ordinary human can do. Averted with some enemy zombies you happen to run into, with the possible exception that they vary a bit more than average. He's not the only one though. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Veradux</a>, who joins your party, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Baron Brixius</a>, who is undoubtedly evil, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Felicity</a>, who appears in the sequel and later joins you.
</li><li> Zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> are just your typical zombies, aside from the fact that they only come out when it's dark, and getting caught in direct sunlight causes them to burst into flames. They attack you without provocation, but there's no indication that they eat your flesh. Interestingly, <em>you</em> have the option of eating <em>their</em> flesh, which may give you food poisoning but is nevertheless helpful for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly">warding off starvation</a>. You can also feed it to pet wolves to heal them without any downsides.
</li><li> Even though it's more of a demon invasion, the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> had a unique view of where zombies come from. From the manual: "Zombies are formed from the corpses of men executed for the most depraved and degenerate crimes against the innocent. They are driven by both the hatred that consumed them in life and the undead hunger for mortal flesh." Though this was the only game in the series where this gets mentioned.
<ul><li> The Black Death are variant zombies that will permanently remove 1 of your maximum hit points and there's no way to reverse this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo3">Diablo 3</a></em> has the Risen Dead, which functions mostly like standard zombies, except that they're being animated by different source, namely the Falling Star, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tyrael's excess power that was leaked when he's falling</span>, which animated those unjustly slain.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfLomax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfLomax">The Adventures of Lomax</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyLivingZombie">Technically Living Zombie</a> variant. The zombies you encounter in the second world are actually lemmings magically turned by Evil Ed into monsters. They are blue and do the Zombie Gait at first, but start running angrily when hit once, and turn back into normal lemmings when you hit them the second time.
</li><li> The latest incarnation of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar">Nexus War</a></em> series has both magical zombies summoned by player necromancers and NPC plague zombies. If a character is sufficiently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">unlucky</a>, it's possible to get one's body ripped in two (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">more</a>) pieces that get resurrected as both kinds. Which are then forced to fight each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>: Zombies are the most basic kind of undead (so basic that you can't even train them when playing as the Scourge) created when any normal human dies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">the Plague of Undeath</a>. Without a necromancer to control them they wander, aimlessly attacking any living who approach.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTwistedTalesOfSpikeMcFang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTwistedTalesOfSpikeMcFang">The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang</a></em>, Dracuman Castle has been invaded by zombies that breathe fire. Only the English version calls them zombies; they were apparently supposed to be quasi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame">Quasimodos</a>.
</li><li> The zombie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheUltimateHauntedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheUltimateHauntedHouse">The Ultimate Haunted House</a></em> is one of the monsters in the house, which sleeps in an iron maiden in a torture chamber in the house's basement. It is mindless, bright green, and looks like its skin is melting off, and unusually for a zombie, it attacks with magic curses rather than directly. Like all of the monsters in the house, it is described as "nasty" and cannot be attacked, only fled from.
</li><li> The zombies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NaziZombies">Nazi Zombies</a></em> were created by being injected with Element 115, and being somewhat controllable (with color-coordinated eye glow as well). While headshots will deal considerably more damage, it is not a requirement and some can live for a few seconds with their head blown off and still attacking you. Injecting them with more 115 can turn them back into being human.
</li><li> The zombies in <em>Last Empire: War Z</em> are plague-bearers, but are prone to radical mutation, they're smart enough to communicate in their native language, and can even be tamed. This led to the development of the Biochemical Center, which lets players manufacture <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteZombie">zombie super-soldiers</a> by genetically modifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> and then injecting either a zombie or a "volunteer" with it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a></em>, the zombies you meet in the game are just as intelligent as living people, and drinking coffee is apparently what keeps them that way. They're also (for zombies) a fairly decent bunch; even Rottytops, for all her threats of eating people and her reputation as a troublemaker and rabblerouser, actually hasn't so much as hurt a fly over the whole series - the only actually villainous thing she has done is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnapping Shantae's uncle Mimic</span>, which she regretted immediately and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">ran away crying out of shame and guilt</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">has been much friendlier to Shantae to try and make up for it</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, there are Zombie Space Pirates, who move just as well as living Space Pirates. In <em>Prime 2</em>, Dark Troopers are added to the mix, being much more similar to classic Zombies. Except with armor and energy-weapons.
</li><li> The minigame "Zombie Tag" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiParty">Wii Party</a></em> involves Mii getting trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCemetery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCemetery">Creepy Cemetery</a> with seemingly classical zombies running amok and trying to turn them into other zombies. The twist is that the whole zombie thing <em>isn't permanent</em>: at sunrise, every single Mii (even the ones that were already zombies in the first place) turn back to normal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> has several variants on this:
<ul><li> The Hive are a combination of parasite and voodoo, being an entire alien species of what are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">The Undead</a>, who are linked to a parasitic worm-like lifeform that drives their bodies. The parasite is technically the only part of any Hive entity that is alive, with the rest of it being powered and animated by the parasite. The Hive being is still self-aware and can think and act on its own, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">but the worm parasite is the only thing keeping it alive, and in order to feed it and grow stronger,</a> the Hive must collect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Light</a> from living beings that they slaughter.
</li><li> The second type of zombie is an artificial type, created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">SIVA</a> from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> reanimating the dead bodies of the Iron Lords that died in its replication chamber</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The Darkness</a> creates a variation of this through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> when it wants to communicate directly with its servants, inhabiting and controlling dead bodies to allow it to speak directly to them, since without it the Darkness is a formless, shapeless mass of malevolence.
</li></ul></li><li> Bit Monster's Gunner Z has zombies that were part of a weapons project by a rogue general who's doing a coup d'etat on the US gov't. Besides the standard zombie and a few usual variants (giant zombie and crawling suicide-bomber zombie), there's the Titan zombie. The Titans are twice the size of the already enormous giant zombies and the Titans have an energy beam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a> that hits as hard as a main battle tank's cannon. Also somewhat unusual is that these zombies are working with military forces - so you face gunner drones, IFV, and tanks using zombies as a screen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a></em>, the Leveller is a dark god who perpetuates an endless cycle where good and evil reign alternately for 1000 years each. The Leveller has created Thralls to be his base troops. Each Thrall is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a> zombie with a hefty axe that can take a good chunk out of its target, if it hits. Backing the Thrall are the equally mindless Wights, these are bloated gasbag zombies that can explode with more force than a dwarf's tossed bomb.
</li><li> The zombies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> took <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>'s virus mutant zombies and ran with it. The zombies here have various mutant strains with varying powers, such as the tank being an 8-foot tall muscle-freak abomination that can smash through obstacles with ease and soak up tons of gunfire from a group of survivors. Likewise, the common infected are implied to scratch and bite the survivors, but they mostly attack by punching and beating on them and kicking/stomping them when they're down.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em>, the Infected are people who have been infected with a deadly fungus that affects them in different stages. This causes them to warp physically as their bodies are readied for the fungus's reproductive cycle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prismata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prismata">Prismata</a></em> has the Grimbotch. It's a cheap attacker that you can purchase early in the game, but it's so unstable that it falls apart after a few turns.

The zombie will act aggressively towards humans until killed (in UFO Defense) or left alive for several turns (in Enemy Unknown) at which point they will hatch into a new Chryssalid.

These zombies act much like the Chryssalid zombies above, but rely on the mental link to their reanimator, and if the psychic alien is killed or disoriented by a flashbang grenade, the zombie will die.

The Lost are humans infected with some sort of alien gas that seems to have been used for terraforming purposes and was not intended to create zombies, as they're just as aggressive to the aliens as humanity. They lumber around, attack humans on sight, are attracted to loud noises, and are vulnerable to headshots. They also have a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteZombie">Elite Zombie</a> subtypes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Dasher</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Brute</a>.

A galit is an undead with a soul attached, and on very rare occasions (or maybe only through a certain ritual, it has not been explained in-story) retain their personality, memories and conscience as well. This is the case with main character Duane, who ironically enough hates seeing undead due to his religion stating it is blasphemy to let corpses go unburned. Due to this form of undeath allowing the soul to stay in place, the galit might more accurately be referred to as revenants or ghouls, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">The Undead</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, "zombie" is used to describe a persona under the control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">XANA</a>.

<ul><li> In paleontology, "zombie taxon" is the term for an extinct species for which fossils dating from an earlier period have been displaced into a more-recent geological context (e.g. if a trilobite fossil from the Permian erodes out of a rock face in the Cretaceous, lands on a dead dinosaur, and is found among the dinosaur's bones in the present).
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_%28computer_science%29">zombie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in computer speak is a CPU connected to the Internet currently controlled by malicious third party such a hacker, a troyan or a virus. Those computers are commonly used to send spam and junk mail or to participate in distributed denial-of-service attacks. Since these computers are "enslaved" by an "evil" master and forced to do menial tasks, they are metaphorically compared to zombies of the voodo variety.
<ul><li> In Linux, when a parent process spawns a child process it must either hang around to watch the child die or declare that it has no interest in doing so. If a child dies when the parent has done neither of these things it cannot pass on and instead becomes a zombie, an empty shell of a process which does nothing more than barely exist until the system gets around to bashing its head in with a spanner. Linux technical documentation has much to say on the subject of ensuring that you do not turn your children into zombies.

That said star is a white dwarf -kind of a stellar corpse- justifies the name.
</li><li> A philosophical zombie is one that can recite <em>Cogito ergo sum</em> without meaning or understanding it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis">The "zombie fungus".<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (At least one SF story exists where the dude doesn't zombiefy ants, but also humans.)
</li><li> "Wombies" (as in worm zombies) are mentioned in "The Gene: An Intimate History" by Siddhartha Mukherjee. They are clearly a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> naming and would rather fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BungledSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BungledSuicide">Bungled Suicide</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2px8w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2px8w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2px8w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some cells of Caenorhabditis elegans are doomed to die for the greater of worm. The name refers to a mutant where the apoptosis doesn't work and they live happily ever after. So, nothing undead, rather the opposite.</span>
</li><li> A zombie company is a company deep in debt that only generates enough profit to cover running costs and to pay the interest on their loans, but not the debt itself. They generally depend on creditors to continue their existence, putting them in a endless life support. The next level is a zombie bank, a financial institution with a net worth of less than zero that keeps on living because the government is paying to keep them hooked on the life support machine.
</li><li> You surely already ran into a smombie - a smartphone zombie. (Voted "Youth Word 2015" in Germany, but possibly made up. The word, not the smombie.) iZombie being a common variant, thanks to the high visibility of iPhones.
