The injury was nearly fatal. But somehow, miraculously, the boy survived. What's more, after that, he was no longer violent.

Kurz recalls a skirmish in Lebanon two years ago, where he fought some Savage pilot <em>way</em> better than Sousuke, and was just about the only target he wasn't able to take down.

For several chapters, he appears to be talking about Larcade, who is introduced as Zeref's son, shares his last name, and is obsessed with killing Zeref's brother, Natsu, for getting all of his father's attention. It isn't until after Larcade is ousted as a demon from the Book of Zeref that it's revealed August was talking about himself, and went unloved by his parents because he kept his true identity a secret from them, since they are both cursed to inadvertently kill the ones they love.

She then reassures a frightened Koichi that it didn't actually happen. However, shortly after this, Rohan sees a dog with a slit, bleeding throat, leading Reimi to reveal that she was the girl murdered and that she and her dog are ghosts who want their murderer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Yoshikage Kira</a>, brought to justice so they can finally move on.

The first story he tells her is about a boy who became entranced by the spirit Hasshaku-sama. The last part of the collection has the young man reveal that he was that boy, and that the entire reason he's making this trip is to return to the village where he encountered Hasshaku-sama. His grandfather had warned him that the seals keeping Hasshaku-sama confined had been broken, and he is rushing back to the village hoping to seek help again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The driver then reveals that she is Hasshaku-sama.</span>

</li><li> Sasuke Uchiha in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em>, when he travels alongside with Boruto back to 20 years in the past, and meets a 12 year old Naruto who's coping with Sasuke's recent defection from Konoha. He tells Naruto (who's unaware of his true identity) the story of "an old friend of his" who left his friends in search for power and how he never gave up on him until he managed to knock some sense into him. All which cheers Naruto up.

She attempted suicide by slicing up her arms, but survived and was glad that she did. When asked what happened to her in the end, she says "I expect she came out to the big city" (the miniseries takes place in New York). Furthermore, she's wearing long gloves...hint, hint.
<ul><li> In another issue of <em>Sandman</em> (the Hunt) an old man is telling his granddaughter a story from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldCountry">The Old Country</a> about a young man of "the People" who goes on a quest to find a princess, only to instead fall in love with a woman of the People he meets on the way.

This was undoubtedly changed for the screen because it was easier to hide "the little girl's" identity than to keep the audience from recognizing Trunchbull in the flashbacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MedicineMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MedicineMan">Medicine Man</a></em> has a rather nightmarish version and subversion of the trope. Dr. Campbell tells Dr. Crane why he doesn't want to tell anyone about the cancer cure he thinks he has discovered while living among the natives of South America &mdash; because another doctor, he explains contemptuously, had discovered a painkiller in similar circumstances, which resulted in another tribe being wiped out by swine flu when the drug company came down to mass-produce it. Later on it's revealed that Campbell himself was that doctor, and he keeps a journal filled with pictures he drew of <em>every single person</em> in the tribe he destroyed. Subverted a bit in that it seems almost a Freudian slip when he reveals this to Crane; it's not clear whether he actually wanted her to know.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneMissedCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneMissedCall">One Missed Call</a>: Final</em>, Emiri&#146;s boyfriend Jin-wo explains to her that at the Sign Language Summit where they had first met, he learned of the death call and how it worked from a deaf violinist whose girlfriend was killed by it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">The violinist knew that he could&#146;ve saved her by taking the call and dying in her place, but he didn&#146;t, and forever regretted it</a>, to the point of purposefully punishing himself until he went deaf. Then near the end of the movie, Jin-wo tells Emiri that knowing her made him stronger, and that he won&#146;t regret again. It&#146;s this that makes her put two-and-two together to realize that the deaf violinist was <em>him</em>. And that he wasn&#146;t going to make the same mistake again as he swipes Emiri&#146;s phone (which had the death call forwarded to her during the climax), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">takes the call in her place</a>.
</li><li> Played with disturbingly in <em>Psychopathia Sexualis</em>. A woman tells some girls a very morbid story of how a mute girl found her voice (via screaming) whilst being raped and then killed her rapists who she and her father had put on a shadow-puppet show for. The girls listening seem very disturbed and the woman narrating it seems sad and nostalgic. In the end she offers a disconcertingly weak "It's only a story" to the girls.

He goes some way into detailing his own part ("I know that babies taste best") but shifts into third person when relating how things turned around. After a man kills a mother to get to her baby, an old man steps up to offer his arm to be eaten instead, spurring others to make the same sacrifice. Gilliam, Curtis' mentor, was the old man; Edgar, Curtis' protege, was the baby.

Although the movie does not expand on this, supplementary materials reveal that the tale was hardly as ancient as the words "Sith legend" implied&mdash;Palpatine himself was that very apprentice. Furthermore, it is implied that Darth Plagueis's ability to manipulate midi-chlorians resulted in Anakin's birth.

Aral reciprocates with the story of "a man I knew once" whose marriage was comparably disastrous. About halfway through his story, he slips and nearly says "me" before correcting it to "my friend".

At one point, she tells the protagonist a story about a group of boys, and at the end it turns out he was one of the characters in the story (although not the one he was expecting). Later, she tells him a story about a little girl, and he sarcastically predicts the "And That Little Girl Was Me" ending (and is so busy being a smartass that he neglects to actually think about why he's been told the story, and fails to learn anything from it). There's also a point where she tells him an anecdote in <em>first</em> person, but ends by saying that it didn't actually happen to her; she just told it that way because that's how the story is traditionally told.
</li><li> Near the end of the dystopian novel <em>Devil On My Back</em> by Monica Hughes, a character tells the protagonist a story that, although he is careful to disclaim it as a fairy story with no particular meaning or real-life relevance, doesn't take much imagination to interpret as a description and explanation of his own actions during the novel.

When in the course of rescuing the businessman they are attacked and wounded by hostile aliens, the secretary unloads on the aliens with a blaster and saves them all. In a slight subversion of the trope, it's not the secretary but her boss who later recounts the tale of a former employer whose house collapsed long ago in a storm, leaving only a terrified and badly wounded little girl at the mercy of those same xenomorphs...

He even Lampshades the transparency of the ruse.
</li><li> In "Father Brown's Story" a priest tells of a man, disillusioned by the death of his beloved sister, who turned to atheism and hated everything religious. Then one night he had a dream of a mysterious woman who he followed to the edge of the sea. It was his sister, who pointed at the ocean and said "It is the holy blood".

The story involves a cunning spy codenamed K.15, pursued by a heavy cruiser near Mars, who uses the limited manoeuvrability of the cruiser to keep on the opposite side of Phobos. When the story is finished, the narrator suggests Kingman knows the story so well, he must have been K.15, and Kingman denies this and stalks off. The third member of the party explains that Kingman was commander of the cruiser.

He starts by claiming that he only spoke to some of those involved and all are now dead or missing, but as his story goes on it is eventually revealed that one of the characters is actually him before he acquired his scars: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is Donovan, aka the Fudir</span>.

Dick talks about the people he'd lost to drug addiction over the years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames">and then lists some of them off</a>.

This caused a feud in which Ragnhild's father and nineteen others were killed; Thorkel was outlawed and made a secret homestead for himself and Ragnhild in the mountains. His story ends with the predictable revelation that he himself is Thorkel Crispfrost.

</li><li> In <em>The Girl from the Coast</em>, Pramoedya Ananta Toer deploys this trope twice removed. After telling how a girl from a fishing village was married by a rich man, lived as a prisoner in a gilded cage, and then was cast aside by the rich man for another wife, and was left to make her way alone in life, the author's epilogue reveals that he had just told the story of his grandmother.

<ul><li> There's a famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> subversion of this. American psychologist Gordon Allport was visiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud">Sigmund Freud</a> and told him a story of a boy he'd seen on the train who wouldn't sit near anyone dirty. Allport said that the boy's mother seemed to be domineering, which might have something to do with his behavior. Freud leaned over to him and said, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend">And was that little boy you</a>?" It was not.
</li><li> A story (perhaps anecdotal or urban legend) of an artist who was commissioned to do the life of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Christ</a> in a giant mural. He started with Christ's birth, using the most cherubic baby he could find as a model, and after years reached the end, but was only stuck on the model for Judas. He simply could not find anyone degraded enough to use, until he finally found a worn-out drunk with the most depraved look and hired him. The drunk could hardly refuse the money, but when they reached the studio and saw the mural he burst into tears. Asked why, he said "I know about this painting. My mother told me about it. I was the model for the Christ child."
</li><li> There is an inversion about Leonardo Da Vinci painting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/TheLastSupper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/TheLastSupper">The Last Supper</a></em>. In order to find the appropriate look for Judas, he went to the local prisons and found a man who looked haggard, angry and dangerous and used him as the model. Some years later he still hadn't found the right person to stand in for Jesus. While pondering the question, a man walked into the studio who looked perfect, clean, with kind features. Leonardo immediately chose the man as his inspiration for Jesus. When Leonardo asked the man if they had ever met, the man replied "Yes, I was Judas."
