</p><p>A red herring is a good red herring when it interweaves itself into the story's events. For example, the murder victim may have been a philanderer. His wife has no alibi. Aha! It was the wife!
</p><p>The wife's lack of an alibi is a red herring. It turns out the wife was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage">shtupping</a></em> somebody <em>else</em> at the time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulSourceOfKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulSourceOfKnowledge">didn't want</a> to provide that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret">information</a>. However, the deceased husband's philandering <em>is</em> what got him killed, as it turns out, by his girlfriend's jealous husband. Philandering as a motive is introduced for good cause, not just to set up suspicions about the wife's lack of an alibi.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFlag">Ao no Flag</a></em>: Early chapters point to Touma being in love with his sister-in-law and former teacher Akiko. Chapter 5 however, reveals that this was a lie that he created to hide the fact he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay">is in love with his childhood friend Taichi</a>.
</li><li> In the first volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>, Kuroyukihime reveals that a Burst Linker known as Cyan Pile is trying to hunt her down to collect the point bounty on her, and she knows very little about the person controlling this duel avatar except for the fact that this person goes to her school (based on the fact that Cyan Pile can challenge her while she's logged into the school intranet). Kuroyukihime initially assumes that it's Haru's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> Chiyu, given the hostility between them in their first meeting (although Kuroyukihime intentionally eggs Chiyu on to gauge her reactions) and that Chiyu is one of a handful of possible Burst Linkers besides Kuroyukihime and Haru. Haru refuses to believe it, since the Chiyu he knows is no good at video games or keeping secrets, and insists on convincing Kuroyukihime. It turns out that Chiyu's Neurolinker was infected with a backdoor program, enabling the true culprit, her boyfriend Taku, to challenge Kuroyukihime remotely (even though he doesn't even go to her school).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> during the Marley arc, the soldier who lures Galliard and Pieck into a trapdoor has their face obscured by the camera angles, this made the readers to speculate that they were someone known, like a member of the Survey Corps in disguise, Pieck even mentions that their face is familiar. Then it turned out that it was an entirely new character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BioMeatNectar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BioMeatNectar">BioMeat</a></em>: the first chapter shows your typical split-screen shot of the main characters, which seems to set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a>. The first one of the five that we see is even given a name, but when the time comes, he decides not to join up with the other four. In fact, he almost gets them killed by cutting the rope one of the heroes is going down. He gets his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a> soon enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ulquiorra appears from the start to be Aizen's right-hand man among the Espada, and the ultimate target everyone needs to reach to save Orihime. When Ulquiorra realises Ichigo thinks he's the top Espada, he reveals he's only the fourth Espada. That said, during his final battle with Ichigo, he reveals a second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">Resurrecion</a> form that he claims Aizen does not know about, suggesting that his ranking was inaccurate.
</li><li> Barragan takes command in Aizen's absence, making it seem to characters that he's the top Espada until it's revealed that he's only the second Espada. It's an unsuccessful example as Kyouraku admits to his opponent (the real number one) he'd suspected all along that Barragan was number two, but had been hoping otherwise.
</li><li> When the different types of Menos are explained to Ichigo, it's said that Vasto Lordes are more powerful than even Shinigami Captains, and that if Aizen brought 10 Vasto Lordes to his side and made them into arrancar, Soul Society would be doomed. The scene immediately cuts to Aizen awakening his newest arrancar, Wonderweiss, and telling him to meet his 20 brothers and sisters. The audience is clearly intended to think that Aizen's army far exceeds even what Soul Society thinks is the worst-case scenario. In the end, this comes to nothing and it's never specified how many Vasto Lordes are in Aizen's army (it's strongly implied that the top 4 Espada are Vasto Lordes, while numbers 5-9 are explicitly not, and Wonderweiss is the only non-Espada who <em>might</em> be a Vasto Lorde). And when the actual war begins, it's turns out to not be Aizen's army that overpowers Soul Society. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Aizen by himself</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Cornelia and Schneizel are set up as two possible suspects for killing Lelouch's mother Marianne, since Clovis, while forced to tell the truth, suggested that they might know something about it. Neither one of them did it; V.V. tried to kill her, but she managed to transfer her soul into Anya's body before she died. Then again, given the significant changes that the plot of season 2 allegedly went through due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">time slot change</a>, it's possible that this could be less of a Red Herring and more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>. It was, however, made clear at the end of season 1 that Cornelia had nothing to do with Marianne's death, contrary to earlier implications.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DancougarNova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DancougarNova">Dancougar Nova</a></em>: Head of the Dancougar team, Commander Tanaka acts friendly enough most of the time, but has a few moments where he gets Scary Shiny Glasses and it looks like he knows more than he lets on, having a few vaguely sinister conversations with his employer, Fog Sweeper. It later turns out to have been a red herring.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, the writer Ohba hadn't decided who the third Kira was when he began writing the Yotsuba arc, and so needed all eight members of the Yotsuba Group to have the potential to be Kira. Therefore he pushed this trope to its absolute limits to place suspicion on every member at one point or another. Namikawa is the biggest example of this, as he's the immediate suspect but also the second to be confirmed innocent after Hatori's death. Other notable red herrings are Takahashi and Mido: Takihashi only seems to exist to serve as a red herring and nothing else is ever done with his character, and many subtle clues point to Mido as the story continues (so many, in fact, that most of them are probably examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a>).
</li><li> During the doppelganger business in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, one of the Marcille's states that has mostly gotten over her issue with eating monsters, after having eaten all sorts of things like merfolk eggs. Laios realizese she is the doppelganger Marcille not due to that but due to her casually pouring out boiling water, an action that earlier in the story nearly got her killed by an angry Undine. Marcille assumes that the merfolk eggs are what tipped Laios off, but is horrified to learn that that part was true, Chilchuck just made Laios keep quiet about that.
</li><li> Red Herrings are a staple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, but a big one happens in the recurring Black Organization meta-arc when Vermouth finally shows herself and it's not who you think it is at all. She's been impersonating Dr. Araide. The suspicious-looking foreign English teacher? She's the FBI agent on Vermouth's trail.
</li><li> Up until vol. 9 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, it's heavily implied that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">that thing back in middle school</a>" was that Izaya stabbed and nearly killed Shinra. This is exactly what Izaya <em>wants</em> people to think.
<ul><li> Since Mika Harima has the same face as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman">Celty Sturluson</a> and has a scar that goes all around her neck, everyone is led to believe that Mika is a corpse that has had Celty's missing head grafted on to it to give it life. It later turns out that Namie manipulated Mika into undergoing plastic surgery that would make her resemble Celty, and subsequently gave her memory-altering drugs to hide the truth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Grand Magic Games arc, it at first seems that only one person had come back from the future to give warnings about what will soon happen, but that that person had given Princess Hisui and Captain Arcadios conflicting information for some reason. During the two's conversation late in the arc, Arcadios calls this informant a woman, causing Hisui to tell him that <em>her</em> informant was a <em>man</em>. It turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Future!Lucy</a> wasn't the only one who came back through the Eclipse Gate... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Rogue's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> future counterpart had also managed to find his way to the past, but for a much more sinister purpose.
</li><li> Invoked with Silver, Gray's father, as well. Silver pretends to actually be the spirit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">Deliora</a>, the demon responsible for Gray's childhood trauma, inhabiting the corpse of his father. In actuality, Silver was brought back to life as his own self by the necromancer Keyes, and was a good person who wanted Gray to put him out of his misery.
</li><li> A slightly more minor example in the form of Weisslogia and Skiadrum not being dead despite Sting and Rogue remembering having killed them. Apparently dragons can alter the memories of humans somehow. (They then both proceed to die a few minutes later, making everything a bit of a moot point.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> The manga drops a bunch of hints that Ed and Al's father Van Hohenheim and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Homunculi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Father</a>, are one and the same. Nope. While they <em>do</em> have an important connection, they're definitely separate people. When Alphonse reunites with Hohenheim, he explains the situation to his father. Hohenheim then asks him if he's sure he wants to tell him, given that the leader of the Homunculi looks just like him. Alphonse is silent for a moment, refusing to back down, and Hohenheim says he's relieved that his son trusts him.

Perhaps two of the best were in "No Noose is Good Noose," indicating two different innocent suspects as the killer. The fact that Utako Mori's name is an anagram for "komori uta," the killer's trademark phrase? The presence of Takashi Senke in the background of one of the photos of suicided students, indicating a possible motive? Both mere coincidence, with no purpose other than to draw smug readers away from the <em>real</em> clues. Although the second served a doubly sneaky purpose.

It is later revealed he was lying and let Sasuke live because he could not bring himself to kill him. Not just that. Everything the reader was ever told about Itachi is a lie or a coverup. The truth about him has only started coming out in recent chapters. It's so dramatic that for most of the series he appeared to be the unquestionable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of Sasuke's storyline, when in fact he's apparently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>.

According to the voice actors of Team 7, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Sakura marrying Sasuke</a> had been planned since the start of the anime because Kishimoto told them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>One Piece</em> uses a Red Herring to take advantage of a recent reveal while hiding another one. When Garp visits Ace in prison and expresses his desire that he had wanted Ace and Luffy to grow up to be Marines, Ace response by reminding Garp this is impossible because "Luffy and I both have the blood of an international criminal mastermind running in our veins." At first glance, this appears to follow the revelation by Garp that Luffy's father is Dragon the Revolutionary. In fact, it does so while simultaneously hiding the later reveal that <em>Ace's</em> father is the Pirate King Gold Roger.
</li><li> Once upon a time, it was widely believed that Shanks was Luffy's long-lost father, and for good reason. There were too many seemingly genuine clues to this for it not to be intentional on Oda's part, which makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of Luffy's father more shocking. This was certainly helped by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">the earlier art style made Luffy and Shanks look a good deal more alike than they do now</a>. Don't lie: you would've laughed at anyone who would have theorized this, if only because Shanks seemed like the more rational choice. Oda probably loves this trope considering how unpredictable One Piece is.
</li><li> This is used as a red herring in regards to Ace, as well. Soon after this reveal, we see a scene where Ace says that he despises his father, rejects him so thoroughly that he uses his mother's name instead. The obvious implication is that Ace is talking about our friend Dragon, but in fact it's revealed that Luffy and Ace are not blood related.
</li><li> The identities of future crew members have sometimes been hidden this way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryTrueCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryTrueCompanion">Vivi</a>, a character who'd been introduced in the Reverse Mountain arc, traveled with the Straw Hats since Whiskey Peak, becoming fairly close with the rest of the crew. At the end of the arc, Vivi is formally invited to join the crew, and even ditches her speech in order to meet up with the Straw Hats... and say she can't come. Shortly thereafter, Nico Robin, a former enemy who'd been introduced not long after Vivi, appears on the Going Merry and invites herself into the crew.
</li><li> Water 7 started with the crew looking for a shipwright and finding a company of six, several of whom getting along fairly well with the crew, while clashing with Franky, a gang leader. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">Kaku and Lucci turn out to be undercover CP9 agents</a> and Franky is revealed as a shipwright with his own tragic backstory, who also opposes <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CP9">CP 9</a>. Franky fights alongside the Straw Hats on the sea train and at Enies Lobby, and at the end of the arc, he joins the crew.
</li><li> Duval's identity was done like this. He started out having a personal beef with the Straw Hat Pirates, but <em>especially</em> Sanji, leading to some speculation that he might be Don Krieg, or at least a customer Sanji beat up in the past. The real answer was far more hilarious: He'd never actually met the Straw Hats before, but he looked <em>exactly</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">like Sanji's poorly-drawn wanted poster.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> episode "Final Countdown", a terrorist group uses a red herring to its fullest extent. They set up an elaborate plan to crash an advertising ship rigged with a bomb into Heifong with its independence as the ransom. As it turns out, this was just a plan to evacuate the city so that the "terrorist group" (which is more like a group of petty, if clever, thieves) can loot the empty city without fear of being caught. Unfortunately for them, the main characters catch on to this ruse and show them what for.
</li><li> Certain series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> have characters who are red herrings for the identity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> Cure. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Fresh Pretty Cure!</a></em> started the trend with the Cure's dancing mentor Miyuki; even the characters speculated she could be the fourth Pretty Cure of the series. (She wasn't, of course). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure">Suite Pretty Cure &#9834;</a></em> had the heroes' classmates Waon and Seika - and the production staff even created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">fake artwork</a> that implied they would become Cures. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure">DokiDoki! PreCure</a></em> topped the others with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> Regina, who shockingly did <em>not</em> join the heroes as a Cure - in fact, the series's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> was a character that had never appeared before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Magical Project S</a></em>. When Romio is talking about how she has selected a third magical girl, she shows a picture featuring Konoha prominently in the foreground and Eimi just casually strolling by in the background. Take a wild guess who the third magical girl is. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">It's Eimi</a>).
</li><li> In early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, it's quite easy to think of Fakir as the human incarnation of the Raven - his hairstyle looks like black tail feathers and his less than friendly personality. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His hair is actually green, and he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobie</a>.</span>

The main protagonists - Emma, Ray, and Norman - have let Gilda and Don in on their plan to escape their orphanage (as it's really a plant that raises kids so they can be fed to demons), but information is soon leaked to the plant's leader, "Mom", meaning that one of the two is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">mole</a>. Norman quickly devises a plan: he'll tell Gilda and Don about separate hidden ropes, and the rope that vanishes will prove which of them is the mole. Many shots of Gilda <em>strongly</em> imply that something sinister is going on with her, meaning this trope is played straight when Norman and Ray don't find a rope in the hiding place they told Don about. However, Norman then reveals that this particular hiding place <em>wasn't</em> the one he told Don about, but rather the one he told Ray that he told Don about, meaning that Ray is the traitor. Naturally, this blindsided almost the entire fanbase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> has two major examples: The witch in the prologue has some marked design similarities to Sayaka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> outfit. Turns out that Sayaka's <em>actual</em> witch form has considerably fewer design similarities. In a more meta example, concept art shows Madoka and Homura both with bows, leading to speculation about Homura being future Madoka. And then Homura is revealed not only to be her own person, but to have a completely different weapon. (As it turns out, the art's still meaningful - Homura can use <em>Madoka's</em> bow, and in the timeline where the latter ascended ends up inheriting it, wielding it in favor of her own weapon to signify a "lighter" aspect of magical girl-ness.)
</li><li> To cite a very early example, the English dub <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em> had a one-off character named Red Herring for completely no reason.
</li><li> A somewhat complicated example occurs during the "Phantom Bullet Arc" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>. At the beginning of the Bullet of Bullets Tournament there are three suspects in the tournament who might be the murderous "Death Gun": Pale Rider, Jushi X, and Sterben. All Kirito and Sinon know about them is their names, so that's all they have in the way of clues. (In the anime, the audience has an extra clue if they were paying attention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to Kyoji</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">during the opening.</a>) The problem is that each of the three separate suspects' names can be read as a reference to death in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">English, Japanese, and German</a> respectively.
<ul><li> In universe, this means that given a choice between going after "Sterben" or "Jushi X", the two Japanese teenagers opt for "Jushi X" because that can be read as the Japanese for "Death Gun" backwards, with the X representing a cross. It is only once "Sterben" is confirmed as "Death Gun" via process of elimination that the Japanese nurse reveals (to the non-German speaking members of the audience) that "sterben" is German for "to die" and is a loanword particularly used in Japanese hospitals.
</li><li> However at the outset, Anglophone members of the audience would tend to be more suspicious about the English name "Pale Rider" since that is a Biblical reference to Death as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Members of the Japanese audience would also have good reason to suspect him, because using Christian iconography for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">Faux Symbolism</a> is fairly common in anime.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheThreeMusketeers">The Three Musketeers</a></em>, Athos suspect that Manson and Iron Mask are working together. However, news come that Manson has been robbed by Iron Mask, so the musketeers abandon this lead. The robbery was a part of the Iron Mask's plan as he and Manson really are working together.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> sets up some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a> to hide the true identity of the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a>. (That it doesn't fully work in the anime version because of his voice is another story...) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a> has blond hair and blue eyes, and there's another character in the cast possessing these traits (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Ryou Shirogane</a>). The manga, in addition to pointing out those similarities, briefly uses <em>another</em> character (Keiichiro) to make a red herring via a subversion of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealingInjury">Revealing Injury</a> trope. The real identity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a> looks <em>nothing</em> like his transformed form, but the abovementioned voice link in the anime version, coupled with healthy amount of Genre Savviness from the audience, renders the whole point moot. His surname "Aoyama" contains the word for "Blue" in Japanese, which gives some hint as to his identity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OccultAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OccultAcademy">Occult Academy</a></em>: The principal of the school, Chihiro, is set up to be the main threat as throughout the series she spies on Maya and disapproves of her snooping around.

The aim apparently was to encourage MJ-friendly readers to keep reading the series after Mephisto erased the Parker marriage by leading them to suspect that she had now become a superheroine (because otherwise she was absent from <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> to make way for new romantic entanglements for Peter). Later it was revealed that it was just one incredible coincidence after another, Jackpot actually was a fan of Mary Jane's soap-opera acting who just so happened to bear a strong facial resemblance and put on a red wig.

To make matters even more complicated, it also turned out there were actually two women who fought crime as Jackpot; the one who appeared in the early <em>Brand New Day</em> issues and who, to make the resemblance to Mary Jane even greater, was shown to have a crush on Spider-Man, eventually got herself killed, transforming from a Red Herring to a Dead one.

Senzo himself isn't even sure he didn't do it with all the nightmares of Jei he has been having. It turns out it was Hama, who has had the seed of Jei inside him all those years since he was nearly killed by the entity. And since Jei's current host has been mortally wounded and is slowly bleeding out, he has been switching between her and Hama as she fades in and out of consciousness before completely possessing Hama and killing Senzo.

Somewhere between chapters 6 and 11, Precia decides to abandon her attempt to go to Alhazred and instead researches how to use a Jewel Seed to revive Alicia. The Promethean Metabolic Auxillary Mechanism, seemingly created to allow Alicia to survive her trip into Imaginary Space, was actually created to revive Alicia fully. What made the latter revelation particularly effective is that before the Promethean mechanism was created, Precia was testing the effect of anti-magilink fields (based on the natural properties of Imaginary Space) on the Jewel Seeds - the reader was fooled into thinking Precia was telling the truth about the mechanism.

He has similar features and the same voice actor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanMaskOfThePhantasm">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</a></em>, the audience is led to believe that the Phantasm is Carl Beaumont. In-story, many characters initially believe the killer to be Batman. The best part is that Andrea Beaumont went out of her way to make everyone think this in-story. She stole into Gotham as the Phantasm in order to kill her first victim, then left and returned a few days later as Andrea (this time on an airplane) before resuming her killing spree. She hoped that this would allow her to plausibly shift the blame for the murders to her dead father, but the Joker (and Batman) eventually caught on. Also in-story, the Joker theorizes that Arthur Reeves hired the Phantasm to kill the mob bosses (and Joker himself) to hide his past deals with them. He confronts Arthur about it and they are interrupted by a call from Andrea which clues the Joker in to the real identity of the Phantasm.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave">Brave</a></em>, the Witch tells Merida that she must "mend the bond, torn by pride", to undo the spell she accidentally put on her mother. Merida naturally assumes this refers to her mother's tapestry &mdash; which she tore apart during an earlier argument. However, the "bond" actually refers to the relationship between Merida and Elinor, and the latter only reverts back to normal after Merida apologizes for her behaviour and admits that this whole mess is indeed her fault (as opposed to the Witch's).
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a red herring <em>inside</em> a red herring! Elsa accidentally hits her sister Anna in the heart with her ice magic, cursing Anna to slowly freeze from the inside out until she is nothing but an ice statue. Only "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">an act of true love</a>" can thaw out her heart and reverse the curse. Well, Hans is Anna's true love, right? So all we need is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss">a kiss from him</a> and she'll be alright. Or so you would think. In fact, Hans never loved Anna in the first place, only using her status as Princess to get into the Arendelle royal family so he could kill both sisters and usurp the throne, just so he could get some respect from his family. Anna realizes that it's Kristoff who is her true love, so Anna tries to find him for his kiss. But then once she finds that Hans is about to kill her sister, she abandons the chance and ended up intercepting Hans's blow to Elsa where her curse freezes her solid just as he is about to do so which saves Elsa from Hans' sword. This counts as "an act of true love", thus reversing the curse. Hey, nobody ever said it had to be a romantic act of true love!
</li><li> The revelation of Hans as the villain also makes the Duke of Weselton a red herring as well. While his decisions and attitude regarding Queen Elsa and her ice powers are certainly reprehensible, he's far more open with his intentions and desires. While he does nearly succeed in his goal of killing the queen, he at least believes what he's doing is necessary and in everyone's best interests, and he makes that clear after Hans lies that Anna is dead. All of this means that, while he is devious, he certainly isn't anywhere near as evil as Hans. For all his paranoia, he doesn't question Hans' story, and falls for his "grieving widower" act just like all the other diplomats do. Hans, on the other hand, is a master manipulator, can alter his plans on the fly, and is perfectly capable of taking full advantage of a crisis to benefit himself, and does all of this while coming off like a saint. The only reason he failed was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Olaf</a> found Anna and kept her alive long enough for her to perform her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.

Nope. Yokai is actually Callaghan, who started the fire so he could steal the microbots and take revenge on Krei for a portal accident that killed Callaghan's daughter. Krei may not even be corrupt, as all the things he does that hint at it could just be honest mistakes and Callaghan is the only one who says he's bad.

Later, all of Sunset's friends and classmates lose their memories of Sunset as a hero and shun her because they only remember her as the jerk and bully she used to be. Trixie gloats when she sees Sunset so miserable, so naturally, Sunset thinks she is responsible for this. Trixie had actually lost her memories of Sunset being a hero as well, and after being convinced of Sunset's story, helps her find the real culprit.

We're led to think this is the young Bruce Wayne and his parents Thomas and Martha, and we're about to see the murder of his parents, but suddenly, Batman swoops in and beats up the crooks.

It turns out she isn't actually the killer, and they make no attempt to explain why she turned evil for a split second.

Charles himself almost dismisses this entirely as being far too convenient.

It's later revealed that Simon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> didn't even like his brother</span>, and John dying from one of the bombs going off was just a bonus while doing the robbery, not a personal priority.

All known Obscurials are under the age of 10, since their Obscurus quickly kills them (Newt has an Obscurus for study whose host, a Sudanese girl, died at age 8). So surely Modesty Barebone, an around-ten-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> who suffered abuse at the hands of her violently anti-magical mother, is a prime candidate for Obscurial-hood.

He managed to survive as long as he did because his magic was so insanely powerful that it kept him alive despite his Obscurus.

He sneaks into Hector's garage that night and looks over their cars. Hector's then exonerated when Brian discovers the cars aren't finished being modified and the tires don't match the tread marks found at the scene.
</li><li> As Brian's leaving Hector's garage, he's ambushed by Dominic and Vince and tries to explain that he's only checking out the competition because he can't afford to lose again. He's able to convince Dominic he's not a cop and they decide to check out more competition: Johnny Tran. While the three of them are looking around Johnny's garage, Brian finds a load of DVD players like the ones stolen from the truck. He reports this to his superiors and they perform a raid on Johnny and his crew. However, it turns out that the DVD players were purchased legally and they were forced to release him.

There's lots of evidence: he buys small childrens' clothes despite not having kids, he has a creepy, suspicious personality, he behaves evasively when Detective Loki shows up to question him, there's even a climactic "resisting arrest" scene before Taylor is subdued, and just to drive it home how psychotic Taylor is, he keeps friggin' <em>snakes</em> in the same trunks as the bloody children's clothes, those clothes also being a clue. The problem is, this is all a Red Herring; Taylor was actually a previous kidnapping victim who simply went bonkers and started <em>imitating</em> the true culprit.

<ul><li> Firstly, there's Jeremiah Wickles. He was the cellmate of Jonathan Jacobo, who'd been investigating methods to create real monsters prior to his death, and he'd also been the Black Knight Ghost, one of the costumes stolen in the museum robbery. The gang investigate him and find a monster-making manual in his library, along with a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> used in monster-making. Turns out that not only is he trying to go straight, but he and Jacobo <em>hated</em> each other and would never have partnered up.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> has at least one such distraction per book. After readers started catching on that the first suspect was never the guilty party, Rowling started upping the ante with hints pointing to a second suspect... who wasn't it either. Then in the sixth book, suddenly, all the people up to something are exactly the ones Harry suspects from the start. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> even indulges in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in book six, with various characters pointing out that Snape and Malfoy had been accused in the last five books. Snape is really the ultimate red herring of the books because he acts suspiciously throughout the books and is the suspect in at least two books, but he is revealed to have been acting on the good guys' side in the final book.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em>, Harry, Hermione and Ron are positive that Snape is trying to steal the above-mentioned stone. He's certainly nasty enough to be the villain. Harry doesn't find out the truth until the very end though, when it turns out poor, shy, stuttering Professor Quirrell had been behind everything that happened all along, and Snape had been trying to protect Harry (while simultaneously disliking him for petty reasons).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em> The trio once more suspects one of the obvious antagonists, Draco Malfoy, believing he has opened the Chamber of Secrets and is attacking the muggle-born students in the school. After some amateur sleuthing they are able to debunk that though, and come to suspect Red Herring #2, Hagrid. Just to keep the cleverer audience members on their toes, Percy begins acting shifty and ambitious, and fits the facts of the case strangely well. By the end of the book it turns out that Tom Riddle, possessing Ron's sister Ginny through his old diary, has been behind the events of the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePrisonerOfAzkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and is out to kill Harry. First reading it, and not knowing Rowling's formula, you wouldn't suspect anything. He betrayed Harry's parents, he's one of Voldemort's loyal Death Eaters and now is out to get the protagonist in order to avenge his fallen master. Despite a few counter-clues, the majority of the book is geared toward making the reader believe this. Turns out Sirius is completely innocent and was falsely accused, and the person that betrayed Harry's parents was Ron's pet <em>rat</em>, who turns out to be an animagus (shape shifter), and is really Peter Pettigrew, an old friend of his parents who was believed to be one of Sirius' victims. Even if you were onto the fact Sirius wasn't the antagonist, you wouldn't have seen that coming.
</li><li> One of the most brilliant red herrings involving Snape happens here too. When he discovers the trio with Sirius and Remus, Snape flat out attempts to murder Sirius, saying "Give me a reason. Give me a reason to do it and I swear I will", which seems downright evil considering we've <em>just</em> found out that Sirius is entirely innocent. The kids put him down, though, and it's all good. Once again, Snape's evil nature is further revealed. Then it turns out that Snape's desire to put Sirius down had nothing to do with the werewolf attacks, or the fact that he was a Death Eater, but because he still honestly believed that Sirius had caused the death of the only woman he'd ever loved, and the very plot point that saves him from being a villain.
</li><li> After the book introduces the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Animagi</a> (Wizards who can willfully turn themselves into animals at will), it seems to strongly suggest that Hermione's newly-introduced cat, Crookshanks, is actually a disguised Animagus. Ron is consistently suspicious of Crookshanks for most of the book, as he seems to be fixated on catching and killing Scabbers the rat, and several characters note that he seems oddly intelligent for a common housecat. Not to mention that the books had previously introduced Professor McGonagall as a cat Animagus, and Hermione's insistence on defending Crookshanks seems to be a set-up for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevilInPlainSight">Devil in Plain Sight</a> plot. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, though, it turns out that <em>Scabbers</em> is a disguised Animagus; Crookshanks attacked him because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDetectingDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDetectingDog">he could see through the disguise</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em> is in more of a whodunnit style, with a variety of suspects who could be working to kill Harry, because popularity of the series had soared after the third book, a large online community had sprung up, and people had caught onto Rowling's style, meaning she had to adapt. Was it the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> headmaster of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcademyOfEvil">Academy of Evil</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> who appears to be suffering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>, or the possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> guest judge who has a vested interest in Harry's success in the tournament? It turns out to be none of these suspects, but instead the gruff-yet-lovable new professor, Mad-Eye Moody, who has been supposedly helping Harry the whole time. Though, truthfully, it was a Death Eater disguised as Mad-Eye Moody, through the use of Polyjuice Potion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, the red herring is less pronounced. There are two concurrent plots occurring: the Ministry of Magic's takeover of Hogwarts, and Voldemort's search for a <em>weapon</em> that can win him the war. There's a possibility though that the two plots aren't so separate when the Ministry-appointed Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Dolores Umbridge makes Harry's scar burn (which only happens when Voldemort is feeling a particularly strong emotion... or is close by). Voldemort has possessed people before, and out of the last four DADA Professors, half have been directly working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Umbridge serves the role of the book's main villain and every other villain has been connected to Voldemort. This theoretical connection doesn't pan out, however. It was either a coincidence Harry's scar burned when Umbridge touched him, or Umbridge's own aura of evil is just that strong. There's a reason there was a trope named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">her</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, Harry suspects his two favorite nemeses, who he has falsely accused before &#150; Snape and Malfoy &#150; of being up to something. No one believes him, however, and there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> when various characters point out Snape and Malfoy have been falsely accused before by Harry. You are almost inclined to believe they are innocent as the obsessiveness of Harry's stalking them becomes annoying to the reader. It is obvious from his point of view that they are up to something. Everyone else gets a big slap in the face when it turns out he was right, and Malfoy lets Death Eaters into the castle and Snape kills Dumbledore. Though it turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Snape was acting under Dumbledore's orders.</a> Notably, Dumbledore never explicitly tells Harry that he's wrong, only that he has it under control. Which is technically true.
<ul><li> There's a great deal of effort put into making it look like Tonks is under the Imperius curse but turns out it was Rosmerta instead and that Tonks's odd and depressive behavior is simply a result of her relationship problems with Remus.
</li></ul></li><li> In a somewhat more obscure case, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> featured a red herring, of sorts: in addition to cataloging the creatures previously mentioned, a number of (at the time) new creatures were featured to help round out the scope of the setting. One of these was the Lethifold - a shadow creature, thick as a membrane, which could slide anywhere and killed people by smothering them and digesting them in their beds. It could only be defeated with a Patronus, which was, at the time, a sort of secondary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a> for Harry. As a result, a lot of people expected one to show up in the final books of the franchise, probably as a weapon used by Voldemort, but it never featured.
</li></ul></li><li> Common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenteelInterbellumSetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenteelInterbellumSetting">Golden Age</a> detective fiction. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyLSayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyLSayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>' <em>Clouds of Witness</em> has a setup not unlike the one in the intro (and the book has several others!) and a later book, with six suspects, is entitled <em>The Five Red Herrings</em>.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>, where the protagonists believe their friends (previously captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>) are hidden inside a box of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Very Fancy Doilies</a>; in reality they're hidden inside a statue of a large red fish - the red herring. A patient in the Heimlich Hospital has a name that is an anagram of red herring.
</li><li> In the second book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xenogenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xenogenesis">Xenogenesis</a></em> trilogy, it's mentioned prominently that plastics are one of the only things that the Oankali can't biodegrade, and are in fact poisonous to them. One suspects on first reading that this will somehow prove important to the humans' resistance to the aliens, but it never comes up again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em> they mention a 'red herring' right in the poem. For good reason because the killer Judge Wargrave fakes his death and then drowns his assistant Dr. Armstrong, leaving the remaining characters Vera, Philip, and William to suspect each other of being the killer.
<ul><li> And when Dr. Armstrong disappears, murdered by drowning by the real killer, the other recall the poem saying 'red herring' and try to be genre savvy and believe that the former was faking this death.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em> several characters, including Vimes himself, note the horrible green wallpaper in Vetinari's bedroom while trying to work out how he's being poisoned with arsenic. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, Napoleon was poisoned by arsenic fumes from green wallpaper, and several murder mysteries have used this as a resolution. It turns out the arsenic is in the candles; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> treasures letters he received saying "We were SURE it was the wallpaper, you bastard!"
<ul><li> Vimes is cynical about clues as they're too convenient, and considers any half-competent criminal can invent half a dozen to leave at the scene of the crime, while any underexperienced investigator will pick up another half-dozen.

They imply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButlerDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButlerDidIt">The Butler Did It</a>. He waits until everyone is in bed, and stalks about the mansion. He is also the only character that has a beard that matches the man glanced shadowing Sir Henry. Then there's the escaped convict, Selden, who has been lurking upon the moor, and the other mysterious man upon the moor, who wants to stay hidden. Most film adaptations, notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHoundOfTheBaskervilles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHoundOfTheBaskervilles">the Basil Rathbone film</a>, like to make Dr. Mortimer seem extremely suspicious, but the book does not. There's also the looming idea that the threat might be supernatural, but none of these are the final solution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohannesCabalTheNecromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohannesCabalTheNecromancer">Johannes Cabal the Necromancer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Johannes Cabal makes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>, much fuss is made about how he has a finite amount of Satan's blood to use in his adventures. That all comes to nothing. It's mentioned a few times in the middle of the book, but by the end it's fallen out of the plot entirely. He never runs out of blood, and it's never a plot point.
</li><li> There's another red herring at the climax, when Johannes tricks the devil into demanding the box of contracts rather than all of the contracts. Thus, Johannes saves the souls of the innocents he coerced into signing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFatherLukeWolfeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFatherLukeWolfeTrilogy">Father, Forgive Them</a></em>, Red Herrings abound. None of them are the true killer, but this example is unusual in that all the suspects insist they wish they <em>had</em> killed the victim, and were present at the time of death, and had the means to do so.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot">Meg Cabot</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AvalonHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AvalonHigh">Avalon High</a></em>, Ellie is suppose to fall in love with Lance and isn't suppose to affect the plot because her namesake Elaine of Shalott fell in love with Lancelot and committed suicide when he didn't return her affections. Ellie decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> and rescue Will anyways. Turns out that her namesake was just the red herring, as she isn't the Lady of Shalott but <strong>the Lady of the Lake</strong>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DetectivesInTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DetectivesInTogas">Detectives in Togas</a></em>, the slave Udo tells the boys he was at a certain place where he heard sounds of swords clashing and someone shouting constantly "Ave imperator, morituri te salutant!" The boys look for one gladiator school and don't find it. And then they stumble upon a blacksmith forging swords with a parrot constantly shouting that phrase and know: Udo was here.
</li><li> The sixth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> novel "The Lord of Chaos" introduces two new characters. One is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Forsaken</a> named Demandred, who is a powerful channeler, can hide his identity, and betrayed the main hero's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">previous incarnation</a> out of spite. Demandred is given a secret mission by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">The Dark One</a> in the opening of the book. The other new character is Mazrim Taim, who is a powerful channeler with a shifty background, appears out of nowhere to offer his services to the hero, and shows no sign of the madness that male channelers who aren't aligned to Darkness suffer. When Taim first appears, the afore-mentioned previous incarnation goes mad in the hero's head and starts screaming about killing the Forsaken right now. Despite all this, Robert Jordan said in an interview that Taim is not Demandred in disguise, and indeed seemed somewhat surprised at the prevalence of the theory. Some fans believe this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a>, because there were just <em>so many</em> clues. The last book confirms that while Demandred <em>recruited</em> Taim for the Shadow, they're not and never were the same person.
<ul><li> Also, the character of Padan Fain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> of frightening powers with a grudge against both sides of the good vs. evil conflict, was generally assumed to be key to how the Last Battle would play out. In the last book he only appears briefly and, though his ultimate plan was pretty horrifying, was killed off before really accomplishing anything. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> indicates that this was entirely deliberate and that Fain had always been intended as a character whose role in the conclusion was minimal but that readers would be drawn heavily to speculate about.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of Fred Vargas' novels have Red Herrings, in regards to the murderer's identity : they are generally sympathetic characters who only seem to be marginal characters. A particularly memorable example is in <em>This Night's Foul Work</em>, where all the Brigade is put on the track of a very plausible culprit by the real killer, Docteur Ariane Lagarde, and it takes Retancourt's attempted murder for Adamsberg to finally discover the truth.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeRRMartin">George R. R. Martin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> series, it's almost a given that characters will lie to achieve their own ends, so there is a lot of misinformation going around. The reader is given a slight advantage as the point-of-view switches around constantly. For example, much of the main plot in the first book is driven by the murder of Jon Arryn, the previous Hand of the King (essentially, the second most powerful man in Westeros after the King). The book leads readers to believe that Cersei and Jaime Lannister are involved in the poisoning. Cersei confirms as much, as she obviously has the most to gain from his death. Jon Arryn had discovered that all three of Cersei's children were fathered by Jaime and not King Robert, and were all illegitimate heirs to the throne. The real answer is a little more complex. The third book clears things up. Jon Arryn was poisoned by his wife, Lysa, having been encouraged by Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish. Lysa then sends a letter to her sister Catelyn at Winterfell that the Lannisters had poisoned Jon Arryn.
<ul><li> The first book also has the attempted murder of Bran. This plot is not completely resolved until the third book, as well. Catelyn believes that Tyrion Lannister sent the assassin and arrests him, leading to a long chain of events. The first book never quite makes it clear who sent the assassin. The dagger was believed to have been Tyrion's, who won it from a bet from Littlefinger. Littlefinger lies to Catelyn, telling her the dagger belongs to him. The third book disproves this, as the dagger had belonged to Robert Baratheon. Joffrey had overheard the king saying that it would be more merciful to kill Bran, rather than live as a cripple. Joffrey sent the footpad, armed with the king's dagger, eager for his father's attention.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">One of Our Thursdays Is Missing</a></em>, one of the suspects in a political conspiracy is actually <em>named</em> Red Herring. Since the characters know they're in a work of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metafiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metafiction">metafiction</a>, this leads to some strange deductions.
<div class="indent">"What about Red Herring, ma'am?" <br>"I'm not sure. Is Red Herring a red herring? Or is it the fact that we're supposed to <em>think</em> Red Herring is a red herring that is actually the red herring?" <br>"Or perhaps the fact that you're supposed to think Red Herring <em>isn't</em> a red herring makes Red Herring a red herring after all." <br>"We're talking serious meta-herrings here."

They are from the same distinct as Rue and Thresh and at different points, Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch all consider/advocate for them to team up. Plus Chaff being close friends with Haymitch and Seeder deliberately seeking out Katniss to thank her for looking after Rue and Thresh's families. Instead, they are both killed in the Quarter Quell without making an appearance despite both being aware of the rebel's plan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWestingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWestingGame">The Westing Game</a></em>, the fact that the clues invoke the song "America the Beautiful" leads the reader (and a couple of characters) to suspect Otis Amber (i.e. Amber waves of grain). Turns out, that was just a coincidence. In fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>all</em> the "America the Beautiful"-related clues were one giant red herring designed to mislead the characters about what the true goal of Sam Westing's game is</span>.

</li><li> In the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMooshaber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMooshaber">Of Mice and Mooshaber</a></em>, there are several plot points that appear important, but lead nowhere. For examples, Mrs Mooshaber, an employer of the ominous state agency Care of Mother and Child was assigned to take care of a boy named Linpeck who is troublesome and roams. She buys him a cake and the details imply that she's going to poison him. However, he appears in the next chapter and is all right. Mrs Mooshaber's job at the agency is another Red Herring: she is one of the good people in the story and a caring old woman. She's in fact Widowed Duchess Augusta, rightful ruler of the country.

</li><li> Throughout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a> series and up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a>, the reader is lead to believe that Nico di Angelo has a crush on Annabeth. In <em>House of Hades</em> it's finally revealed that he's really had feelings for Percy the whole time.
</li><li> Two of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dinoverse">Dinoverse</a></em> books have this in the form of the amber key. The characters know that an amber key and preventing a disaster are essential to getting home. They find a key-shaped fragment of amber that sets off happy feelings in anyone who touches it, and spend a lot of effort on the thing, but it turns out that the key is a dinosaur with amber markings who needs to survive a difficult event. The actual key is only useful in distracting other dinosaurs when a character fucks up, and is given no further thought or explanation.
</li><li> The first few chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TyrannosaurCanyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TyrannosaurCanyon">Tyrannosaur Canyon</a></em> set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest">Last Request</a> to deliver a dead man's treasure map to his estranged daughter. Instead the deliveryman spends the whole story tracking down the treasure himself and trying to keep the map out of the wrong hands. The estranged daughter is addressed in the final few pages, outside the plot entirely.

He learns about the attack from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy">dying</a> Special Circumstances operative, and desperately tries to get a message back to the Culture. After the attack is foiled, the reader learns that he never made it; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">he was killed by the Chel</a> and only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">restored</a> long after the events. His story seems to be there mainly to have a potential explanation for the Culture learning about the plot other than the real one; that one of the Chel involved was actually working for the Culture all along.
</li><li> The second section of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDragonWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDragonWaiting">The Dragon Waiting</a></em> is a murder mystery, and is packed with red herrings. Even the identities of the protagonists are subject to crimson ichthyology: as of the beginning of the section, all the protagonists are using assumed identities <em>which are unknown to the reader</em>, who is left trying to guess not only which of the inn's guests is the murderer, but also which are the three protagonists in disguise. The chances are good that the reader will be proven wrong about at least one guess, possibly by having an apparent protagonist become the next victim, before the truth is revealed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouBeTheJury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YouBeTheJury">You Be the Jury</a></em>: Usually, one or two of the illustrated evidence exhibits helped to reach a verdict of guilty or not guilty.

Simon initially thinks that it's Cal (as in Coolidge) or possibly Martin (as in van Bueren). In reality it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Bram, which is a shortened version of Abraham</span>.
</li><li> The ending of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> book <em>Long Shadows</em> implies that Squirrelflight killed Ashfur, due to her showing up late with fur covered in mud (his body was found in a stream). It turns out she was just being clumsy, and by doing so she distracted the reader from the true killer, Hollyleaf.

She also hears singing coming from the cellar, and suspects there might be a <em>third</em> ghost. The climax reveals that no, it&#146;s a local street person whom Phoebe lets stay there when it&#146;s too cold or wet outside (she&#146;d offered him a regular room, but he refused).
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHigginsClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHigginsClark">Mary Higgins Clark</a> novel <em>Remember Me</em>, a couple goes away for the summer to recuperate from the death of their young son.

Her husband hovers over her constantly and insists that she needs to be confined to a mental hospital. However, it turns out that his concern, while overbearing, was genuine. It turns out that the culprit is his ex-girlfriend, who's trying to drive her insane to the point of killing herself so that she can get him back&mdash;the nightmares have been induced by piping the sound of an accident and a crying child through their vacation home.

The protagonist Tracy is led to believe that some of those protesting the decision may be willing to bomb the mine to get their way, and she connects this with her prophetic visions when she realises that what she's been seeing is a cave-in. She also concludes that the hall at St Bernard's Park, where a model of the mine is on display, has been targeted for the same reasons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In reality, what she was seeing was a particularly destructive earthquake, which would have gotten a lot more people killed at the mine and at the Park if she hadn't acted on her visions.</span>

Always smiling! Ha! If you ask me, you're all empty inside." Sidney's has a part that says "if you're not afraid of hurting the big, empty-headed man.". They deduce from those lines that Sheila hid the diamonds in the Smilin' Sam statue. So, one night, they go over to it and drill some holes in one of its feet in hopes of finding the diamonds. They don't find any, and get caught by P.T.'s mom.

This deduction is backed up by Aiden ordering a lot of bunches of bananas. It turns out, however, that he ordered all those bananas because some nutrition guru told his girlfriend that she should be on a banana-only diet.

The official Magic story articles and the card reveal schedule were aimed at creating this gradually unfolding mystery, and naturally they put in a couple of fake-outs. There are references to a fourth angel sister, sibling to Gisela, Sigarda and Bruna, who Avacyn killed a long time previously, but she's left as a background detail and the story has nothing to do with her<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5qgeg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5qgeg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5qgeg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although the presumably white/black fourth sister rapidly became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, and Magic has never been above giving characters who became unexpectedly popular more attention, so she may become relevant somehow in the future - or at least get a card and some backstory in a Commander release or something</span>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Justice for All</a></em> Adrian Andrews seems like the killer due to both motive and placement, but it turns out that she merely framed your client Matt Engarde with the already-dead corpse. The real killer? Matt himself, by proxy of an assassin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Investigations</a></em> gives us the ridiculously innocent, fluffy, naive Colias Palaeno. The twist is that he's actually innocent of everything despite being so obviously non-evil that he looks guilty. From the same game, Zinc Lablanc II, an irritable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a> who's obsessed with being on time and is so obnoxious that he's bound to be your initial suspect.
</li><li> From the same game, we get the intro to case I-5. It's probably unintentional, but due to the the way Edgeworth's dialogue is worded, you'd think Kay commited arson and got away with it. While she does get in a few troubles at the beginning, she's not guilty of anything and the plot point regarding her arrest is dropped in about 10 minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice's</a></em> first case has Olga Orly, who's not only the first witness other than your client, but has a suspiciously timid and innocent demeanor. But she's not the murderer&mdash;her only part in the crime was helping the victim cheat in his card game and getting knocked out when it didn't work.

<ul><li> Herman Crab, from the DLC case "Turnabout Reclaimed". He behaves suspiciously throughout the case and treats Phoenix Wright with distaste. On top of this, he's the only character in the case who didn't testify during the first day of court - a big red flag for the savvy player. It turns out he <em>is</em> hiding something (a secret with 5 Psyche-locks, which typically are given to plot-critical secrets), but he's not the one who killed Jack Shipley. Instead, what Crab is hiding is that he and Jack Shipley didn't actually put the first orca down like they said they would, but instead moved her somewhere else. That and Crab keeps tabs on the marine life using the TORPEDO system, the problem being that the system is illegal.
</li><li> During the third case, an incriminating piece of evidence against the defendant, Juniper Woods, is a recording of a woman shouting "You're a goner!", presumably to the victim. At one point, Athena notices that due to the poor quality of the recording, the voice could actually be saying "Hugh O'Conner", the name of a character in the case. Turns out the tape actually <em>was</em> saying "You're a goner!"

All throughout her cross examination, she starts to display everything associated with an <em>Ace Attorney</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: having a major transformation sequence, her sprite when you start to break her argument is borderline terrifying implying she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>, she is in a position of power, was beneath suspicion and she has an unsettling theme. You even prove she could have committed the crime and it looks like she is the only person who could have done it... but she has no motive to have done it.
</li></ul></li><li> In-universe example: From the police's point of view, the defendants are always Red Herrings, with something making them seem suspicious enough to arrest. Whether it be because they were found at the crime scene, were framed by the real killer, had confessed, or otherwise had "decisive" evidence implicating them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em> gleefully has the characters and the player misinterpret almost everything that happens in the plot. Pretty much nothing is as it seems. For example <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main character is shown to be killed by a major side character. Then it turns out there's someone who can control human bodies... then it turns out the main character wasn't even the guy who the side character killed... and then it turns out the guy who was killed didn't stay dead</span>. Sometimes this leads to an odd case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Right for the Wrong Reasons</a>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns out the main character was killed by the side character in an accident</span>.

<ul><li> There's also a "meta-example": in one of the bad endings the player can get, Chance poisons the protagonist to death. So if the player got this ending before getting the good ending, then the player might naturally assume that this means Chance is the killer. She's not; the killer is someone else. Chance did poison the player in a bad ending because he was getting too close to the truth, but the truth in Chance's case is not that Chance is the killer, but that Chance was hatching <em>her own, completely unrelated</em> plan to steal the valuable data that sparked the murder plot, and the murder actually screwed that plan up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> A common trope in the franchise. Often, an explanation for an unusual event is given, but later proven false and the true cause is revealed, allowing the player to piece by piece set together the whole picture of what happened in the past or is happening now during the multiple routes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>, the identity of the real vampire serial killer is masked in all routes and is not the first major antagonist that Tohno Shiki is forced to confront. In the Near Side routes, Nrvnqsr Chaos serves as the Red Herring. In the Far Side routes, a turned Yumizuka Satsuki serves as one. In Kohaku's route, the plot contrives an extra layer of Red Herring.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> has two of them: 1. The Sonozakis' Yakuza connections. More specifically Oryou being the mastermind of all the murders. 2. Oyashiro's Curse. Both of these are actually quite obvious to those familiar with Knox's Decalogue. Since Oryou was not introduced into the overall story until the fourth arc (of eight), Knox's 1st rules her out from being guilty in the chain of murders. Knox's second rules out Oyashiro/Hanyuu. Either way, VERY nastily deconstructed since the pursuit of these red herrings is half of the cause of the cycles of madness and death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NineHoursNinePersonsNineDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NineHoursNinePersonsNineDoors">Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</a></em> tries to convince the player that multiple innocent characters are Zero, the mastermind of the Nonary Game.
<ul><li> The initially most suspicious one is Seven. He is an apparent amnesiac, who could easily be lying, and comes off as brash and violent, picking fights with almost every other character. It turns out he is genuinely an amnesiac, and is actually a kind and selfless detective who rescued the children of the first nonary game.
</li><li> Midgame, the suspicion is cast on Snake. He disappears abruptly, and the characters bring up the idea that Zero must be one of them. The narration suggests that Snake could be watching over the other players after a staged disappearance. The suspicion subsides after the characters find his 'dead body', and by the time it's found he is still alive, there's a new suspect...
</li><li> Santa. He becomes the most suspicious in the Safe and True paths (especially if the player achieves the Coffin end, an unfinished True end). In the last part of the Safe end, Snake, Ace, Clover and Akane are all dead, Lotus and Seven are mourning and Junpei is with Akane and Santa is the only character unaccounted for. So it becomes clear who is speaking when Zero directly responds to Junpei over the loudspeaker. In the true end, Santa abruptly holds a gun to Akane's head and takes her hostage. If you accidentally get the Coffin end, you'll never learn that this is a ruse and Santa is just an assistant to Akane, the true Zero.
</li><li> Santa also becomes suspicious along with Seven after Snake's apparent death, as Clover deduces that they were the only ones that could've opened the number 3 door to kill Snake (if not convinced that Snake is still alive, she'll even lead them away and kill them along with June in the Axe Ending.) In reality, Ace was the sole murderer, as he'd stolen the Ninth Man's bracelet.
</li><li> The game's characters also bring up the legend of a preserved Egyptian mummy called "All-Ice" on the Titanic enough times that you'll probably come to think that she must be important to the plot somehow. The fact that you <em>need</em> to learn about her and Ice-9 to access the True Ending adds further credence to this. A-nope; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> <em>does</em> show a mysterious woman in Egyptian garb greeting the characters, but she has no importance to or impact on the main plot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> The epitaph is a riddle that initially seems as though it describes a grisly ceremony that will revive Beatrice the Golden Witch if no one solves it, but it really has nothing to do with any kind of ceremony at all and it's not actually why the murders are happening. The killer deliberately arranged the murders to resemble the epitaph in order to mislead and terrorize their victims.
</li><li> Kinzo Ushiromiya, the person who supposedly started said ceremony, turns out to have been dead for almost two years and only an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> was making it seem as though he was still alive.
</li><li> Everything about Kanon and Shannon as presented in the earlier games is a herring so strong that it almost caused a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a>. Specifically, their specific mysteries were important to the over-all murder mystery; but, the fervor in the fan community around those personal mysteries created a sinkhole into which all analysis of the murder sank.
</li><li> Episode 5 has the scene where a number of people are gathered in the dining hall, and there's nobody outside in the hallway. Yet suddenly, a knock on the door is heard, and when the door is opened there's a letter outside. Earlier, the narration talked at length about one of the people present fiddling with a tape player, so it's natural to suspect shenanigans involving playing back a knock from a tape. Erika (the detective) assumes exactly that. However, it turns out to be false.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17">Ever17</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Kid having amnesia and having strange glimpses of future events and knowing things about people that he can't possibly have known. Sounds a lot like Tsugumi's amnesiac friend from the research lab who could see the future, right? Even the ages seem to match up. But it's not him, obviously.
</li><li> Furthermore, Coco and Sara seeming to have some obvious plot-related connection due to playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe">similar</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">character roles</a> in their respective routes and knowing the same lullaby. The Kid even has a flashback/vision on Sara's path about a man scolding a crying little girl about her having everything she's wanted thanks to the loss of another girl's life, which seems to strongly imply that the reason Coco only shows up as an apparent ghost on the routes where Sara is part of the cast has something to do with Sara's past and powers. But it turns out that they're one of the few pairs of characters in this game that <em>don't</em> have any meaningful relation with each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FleuretBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FleuretBlanc">Fleuret Blanc</a></em> has an in-universe example that led a certain character astray: Kant assumed the judges were gunning for him because he hacked their computer, when in actuality they never figured this out. In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>, they were actually motivated by his theft of the placards, something he thought was irrelevant.

Maou's and Kyosuke's interests align frequently, Kyosuke's stepfather suspects him of being Maou right out of the gate, and the easiest way to stop Maou from escalating his plans is to get Kyosuke an early happy ending with one of his love interests. However, playing all the way to the true ending reveals that Maou is not Kyosuke, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">presumed-to-be-dead</a> older brother, who's existence was hinted at in an easy-to-miss family photograph early on in the story.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Nameless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Nameless">Nameless</a></em>, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Secret Character</a> that's hinted in certain scenes on other characters' routes to be a doll the female protagonist forgot about from her childhood.

But nope; the secret character turns out to be someone whose face is never seen in any other character's route.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em> has this in spades:
<ul><li> When Sigma is cut on the hand and bleeds white blood, the player is led into believing he's a robot. He was also present in the GOLEM room, when a robot began to talk about how a robot could probably pass for a human... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's not, he just has cybernetic arms. Luna is, though, and this is foreshadowed by her also being present in the GOLEM room.</span>
</li><li> Phi's superhuman-seeming jumping abilities make her seem non-human. Which makes her seem like an incredibly likely candidate to be a robot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's not. Her jumping abilities are explained eventually and have nothing to do with Phi herself.</span>
</li><li> Dio is presented as so blatantly evil that the player either decides he's the mastermind at first or concludes it's ridiculous to think that he's anything more then a red herring. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both of these expectations are wrong- Dio is indeed villainous, but he is not Zero nor does he have any idea how vast Brother's plans are.</span>
</li><li> Throughout the game Quark, a little kid, is constantly passed off by Sigma as being a ridiculous candidate for any of the murders or bombings, or the real identity of Zero Sr. Dio also accuses him multiple times of being a manipulative sheep in wolf's clothing who made the choice of betraying various characters, which is always seen by other characters as Dio making excuses. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out Quark really <em>is</em> just an innocent little kid, and did absolutely nothing wrong throughout the entire game.</span>
</li><li> In Luna's route, you deduce that, contrary to what was first thought, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luna killed the old woman because her AB Room and K's AB room (where the woman's body was found) had been swapped, so the room where the body was found in was actually hers.

</li><li> In Luna's route you deduce that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clover was the one who probably killed Luna. She didn't. In fact, Luna didn't even die</span>.

Most notable is the literal red herring, labelled "This is a red herring" in the inventory.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Falcon:</strong> Yes. I wish to closely examine and question the piece of evidence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">that is overtly labeled as a red herring</a>.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinraiBrokenBeyondDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ShinraiBrokenBeyondDespair">Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair</a></em>, there are a few suspects that seem like the culprit.
<ul><li> Hiro. He had an argument with Momoko shortly before her death, something that was apparently an all-too-common occurrence in their relationship. He was also the one who borrowed the keys from Rie to go to the bathroom, enabling him to open up the guest room where Momoko died. The latter piece of evidence means that he's the right choice of the four suspects (him, Runa, Kamen and Mika) Raiko comes up with after the questioning period... but then he winds up dead himself. While it's possible to accuse him of Momoko's murder, Raiko will conclude that if that happened, Kamen would have killed him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a>, leading to a bad ending.
</li><li> Runa. She had once been in love with Hiro, and occasionally clashed with Momoko because of the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> personality. Like Hiro, she also had an opportunity to kill Momoko. However, she had no reason to kill/try to kill Kotoba, so while she can be accused of the murder, doing so leads to a bad ending.
</li><li> Kamen. While she's best friends with Momoko, she can't stand Hiro. She is supposedly seen stabbing Hiro with a knife, as well as being missing for much of the night, so Taiko becomes convinced she's the culprit, and almost everyone else agrees with him. Like with the other two, it's possible to agree with Taiko, in which case Kamen is arrested for a murder she didn't commit. It turns out that she was part of what she was convinced was a prank, along with Momoko, Kotoba and Hiro, not realizing that Momoko planned on killing Hiro, Kotoba and herself in order to frame Kamen.

</li><li> Kaoru gives Akira a talisman bracelet to protect himself against the Urashima Woman. However, if he actually tries using it, then it has no effect and the Urashima Woman will kill him anyway.
</li><li> At the beginning of the Kubitarou case, it's explained that the spirit is likely the ghost of a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>. However, it's eventually revealed that the rumour was mistaken, and the actual Kubitarou is a young woman who's not acting out malevolence (though she is still responsible for the decapitation of various innocent animals and people).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The Justice Hammers. More specifically, the numbering of the Justice Hammers, from smallest to biggest. Everyone thinks that they were used from one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">four</a>, but it's eventually discovered that the culprit used them out of order to throw everyone off.
</li><li> After Kyoko says Makoto is the least likely among the group to be The Mastermind and he agrees, the screen flashes back to his mysterious daydream where he tells himself that his goal is to stay in the academy. He didn't end up being The Mastermind, obviously.
</li><li> To assist with murders, the boys are all given a toolkit while the girls receive a sewing kit. While the toolkit is relevant, the sewing kit never sees use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The fake Byakuya Togami. He just turns out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">nameless</a> Ultimate Imposter, who has no real identity of his own. Monokuma explicitly states that the mystery didn't turn out to be important.
</li><li> Nagito Komaeda &mdash; though perhaps unintentionally. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">He looks like</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantDoubleCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantDoubleCasting">has the same voice actor as</a> Makoto, and his name is (accidentally) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">Significant Anagram</a> which suggests that Nagito <em>is</em> Makoto. It's all just a coincidence.
</li><li> The countdown timer. Junko admits it was just there to provide atmosphere and to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> on herself.
</li><li> In Chapter 1, before the murder even happens, Peko is left to guard the circuit breaker so that nobody can cause a blackout and commit a murder in the dark. A blackout indeed happens (with a subsequent murder), and it's later revealed that Peko left her post to go to the bathroom. It's implied that the killer had slipped her laxatives and/or tampered with the circuit breaker in the room. Both of these are false trails; Peko's stomach problems were just a coincidence, and the killer never touched the circuit breaker (although the circuit breaker <em>was</em> involved, but not in the way the characters believe.)
</li><li> In Chapter 2, a significant chunk of the Daily Life is dedicated to talking about the mysterious serial killer Sparkling Justice and then Sparkling Justice's calling card is found at the murder scene, clearly trying to invoke the Genocide Jill reveal from the first game. This turns out to be a classic fakeout; none of the students have any connection to Sparkling Justice, and after Chapter 2 Sparkling Justice is never mentioned again and has no relevance to the plot whatsoever. Although, at the end of the second trial the killer (Peko) briefly <em>pretends</em> to be Sparkling Justice to throw the other students off the trail.
</li><li> This can happen to overly paranoid players in Case 3. Fuyuhiko shares some very similar proportions with Ibuki, Akane explicitly states that the hospital gowns are unisex when she brings up the idea of taking Nagito's and you're unable to personally account for where he was when the murders supposedly took place. If accused, he'll threaten to cut his stomach open again to prove his innocence, and later on in the case he himself brings up the body proportions argument, which turns out to be perfectly meaningless and yet causes a slip of the tongue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">leads to the real killer</a>.
</li><li> Also in Case 3, Monokuma's movie, despite Hajime seeing it during the investigation and suspecting the murderer was imitating it, turns out to have had nothing to do with the murder.
</li><li> In chapter 4 there's mention of how some of the murders have been very similar to the events of the previous game, there's a statue of Sakura in the building and the person who died, Nekomaru, was a figure who cared about the others. From this and some of the oddities of his death the player can easily be led to think that his death was a mirror of Sakura's, where he killed himself to help the group. Though helping the group was <em>part</em> of the motivation behind it, it wasn't a suicide at all.
</li><li> The Sonia/Kazuichi/Gundham relationship appears to be setting up to some kind of conflict, perhaps by creating conflict when one of the three is murdered. Instead, Gundham murders someone <em>else</em>.
</li><li> At Sea King Industries, you find the construction site of the Monobeasts... as well as another station that seems to be building a human-looking android. This hints that one of the characters might actually be an android, but while there <em>is</em> an AI among the cast, the whole setting is a computer simulation so no androids are actually required.

<ul><li> When exploring the cold sleep room, it's revealed that Kaede has a younger twin sister, suggesting that maybe she could be the mastermind and the two are trying to emulate Junko and Mukuro. This turns out not to have a bearing on anything, and said sister may not even be real, especially since it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tsumugi who suggested (and probably wrote) it</a>.
</li><li> In the first case, it's suggested that the victim could be killed with a ball thrown from a room directly opposite, and Gonta (who was in that room at that time) is implied as a possible culprit since he had the strength to kill with a thrown ball. In the end, this turns out to be irrelevant.
</li><li> In Chapter Four the characters enter a virtual-reality world, using high-tech VR headsets. Miu speculates that if someone connected their VR headset wrong, they might "body swap with someone". After a murder happens in the virtual world, this throwaway line seems to hint that body-swap shenanigans are in play, e.g. the murderer body-swapping with the victim or something like that. Nothing like this happens, however (although the solution <em>does</em> involve one of the characters connecting the VR headset wrong and having their mind messed up as a result).

A mole on the protagonists' side means the villains obtain Qrow's information at the same time the heroes are informed, and Volume 5 becomes a race to see who can gain control of the Spring Maiden and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower">Relic of Knowledge</a> that only she has the power to uncover. The villains, led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">Cinder</a>, reach them first and, once satisfied that Vernal is indeed the Spring Maiden, force her and Raven to work with them. Raven, who has long prepared for this day, sets off a plan to pit the protagonists and villains against each other while she and Vernal steal the Relic for themselves then vanish back into the wilderness. It's only during the volume finale when Cinder betrays everyone, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">her own master</a>, to steal the Spring Maiden's power for herself, does she learn just how extensive Raven's planning has been: Vernal was just a decoy. Raven was the real Spring Maiden all along. She killed the young Spring Maiden many years ago after deciding that the child would never be able to handle the consequences of the power, which transmitted the power to her. She then molded Vernal into a decoy who could take the fall for her should anyone ever come looking.

He put the beers "behind the red herring" as a way of saying "this isn't actually important anymore."
<ul><li> Later on, a character was introduced who the author has nicknamed "Eric the Red Herring." He was set up to look like the person who had been summoning a fire monster, but if it had been him, then he wouldn't be on this page.
</li></ul></li><li> After Dina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WalkyVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WalkyVerse">It's Walky!</a></em> was killed, there were numerous hints, including a strip of Walky flat-out <em>asking</em> Joe, that she may have returned (in the past) as The Wanderer. Nope. (He <em>was</em> on the right track in two ways, though: first, The Wanderer <em>is</em> the spirit of a murdered love interest - namely, Linda's David, and second, Dina <em>does</em> return, in an afterlife sequence.)
</li><li> At one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> Halloween party, one girl comes dressed as a superheroine, and Torg notes how "odd" it is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">they've never seen this girl and Zo&euml; together</a>. The girl isn't Zo&euml; &mdash; she's Sasha, who we've never seen before.
<ul><li> In the chapter Aylee, Torg and Aylee end up in a dimension <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">overrun by something called "ghouls"</a>, though nobody knows what they actually are. Aylee starts to be haunted in her dreams by a figure in white robes adorned with jewels. In the meantime, some minor characters are doing research into what Aylee's gigantic dragon-like form may have been, and one of the suggestions they come up with is Rithuly, ruler of the demonic Rayths, who appears as both a gigantic dragonish thing and a jewel-wearing man, and is supposed to always be looking for the perfect mate. Torg and Aylee even meet an alternative version of Kesandru, who in their dimension had made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> with Rithuly. And then the <em>real</em> answer to what the ghouls are comes right out of nowhere and makes perfect sense.

When Mafia Ninjas show up, roadie and seemingly new character Aaron, who resembles Sam with a goatee and new haircut, panics and confides his fear of being caught in Fuzzy. Eventually Mr. Black confronts Aaron, accuses him of being Sam, and swings his sword... Only for Aaron to block it with his bionic hand. Yup, it's fellow refugee Jackson. Meanwhile, Crash, another roadie, shaves off his beard and removes his hat, revealing a familiar hairstyle...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em>, the infamous 434th episode foreshadowed a future conversation between an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">evil'd up Black Mage</a> and another character. This single strip grew nearly six years worth of thick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTree">Epileptic Tree</a> forests. After the conversation actually appeared, the major deaths that happened right before it were reverted, and the creator admitted that it was just made to distract people from actual important mysteries.
<ul><li> Arguably, everything involving Dr. Swordopolis and Darko, as well as the latter "unlocking the Nexus" within Black Mage. A lot of build-up, a lot of foreshadowing, and then absolutely <em>nothing</em> comes of it. The fact that such things are common in the story was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/2009/05/21/episode-1130-so-close-yet-so-far/">lampshaded by Black Mage himself.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>, emphasis is placed on an old photo of six characters from the earlier generation of students, only one of whom we have never met. Her identity is later revealed rather offhand and unspectacularly, and though she may turn out to be important, being a Valkyrie, she doesn't seem to be that relevant to the mysteries about the characters' parents.
<ul><li> This was also done unintentionally in the second chapter. There's a single page focusing on a group of glowing photos showing footprints in the sand. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has said that he intended these pictures to be important later on, but later dropped the idea.
</li></ul></li><li> The creator of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vonslayer.com">Von Slayer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had an accidental red herring. She asked fans to look for clues to figure out the name of a main character who's name at that point was yet to be announced. Seeing the character run away with (among other things) Tea Party plans and the period it took place, people linked it to the Boston Tea Party. They were wrong.
</li><li> In Book 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fans">Fans!</a></em>, Di is seeing a man who looks suspiciously like Keith Feddyg, and sure enough, Feddyg is not only one of the villains, but makes himself the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> over the course of the story. However, Feddyg even comments on the resemblance, in a way that makes it clear there's no connection between them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KevinAndKell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KevinAndKell">Kevin &amp; Kell</a></em>, Kevin's father is suspected to be the assassin Rabbit's Revenge sent to kill Sid at Herd Thinners because the victim's blood was found on his jacket. When Kell confronts her father-in-law, he claims Rabbit's Revenge was trying to kill him as a scapegoat and that Angelique wrote the message on the wall. It turns out that they framed each other and the real culprit is technically Danielle; she couldn't bring herself to kill the victim, and he accidentally shot himself with her stake gun.
</li><li> Also connected to <em>Kevin &amp; Kell</em> is its 2004 crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault">General Protection Fault</a></em>, "A Tail of Two Species". One would suggest that their dimensions are intertwined from the storyline's progression. However, The Gamester, an omniscient being that protects/oversees the GPF dimension, suggests the connection isn't supposed to exist: Nick combining the MuTeX with Project Velociraptor caused some weird issues with space-time that The Gamester needed to fix as a result.
</li><li> In the ZX Spectrum game <em>Everyone's a Wally</em> there exists a "Red Herring" item.
</li><li> In Act 6 Act 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, uu makes an offhand comment about his game skills:
<div class="indent"> BuLLSHIT. I AM BASICALLY THE MASTER OF ALL RED HERRINGS.
</div><div class="indent"> THEY SWIM THROuGH MY VEINS. THIS WAY AND THAT.
</div><ul><li> Later, it is revealed that uu is not a troll at all, making his red blood a <strong>literal</strong> Red Herring.
</li><li> In an earlier example, the Trolls often made reference to an "invincible demon" that ran rampant through their session and ruined everything. Since the nebulous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Lord English, had been described as "invincible" before, many readers assumed that he was responsible. Then a later flash revealed that Bec Noir was the "demon" in question, and Lord English had nothing to do with it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">Hussie later admitted that this misdirection was deliberate on his part.</a>
</li><li> This has led to the fans outsmarting themselves at times. Comments like "The story's hinting so heavily at the reveal being X that I know it cannot <em>possibly</em> be X" are rather common, and then it turns out it really was X all along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/StandStillStaySilent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/StandStillStaySilent">Stand Still, Stay Silent</a></em>: In the prologue, Saku Hotakainen is a perfect candidate for that guy in outbreak stories who turns out to have been sick all along.

One of the symptoms is supposed to be vomiting, and Saku spends the segment being seasick on his brother-in-law's jacht while the brother-in-law in question is telling his sisters all about the quarantine room he installed on the boat, but hoping he won't have to use it because it isn't quite finished. Then we get Saku's young nephew, who just found out about the disease's deadliness on the news, telling Saku about it and Saku replying that he hopes he has it. A photo of the family from two weeks later, the maximum incubation time of the disease, shows Saku huddled in a big bed with the rest of the family, hinting nothing happened disease-wise. The vomiting being actual seasickness is confirmed via Saku's great-grandson Lalli, who's one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmune">The Immune</a>, being prone to seasickness.

And wow, Ramael sure looks guilty, doesn't he? Turns out that was by his own design; if he was arrested as the killer then the lock-down would end... meaning the keyholders wouldn't be in set, isolated locations where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor">Xaphrael</a> could easily pick them off.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BatmanTheAnimatedSeriesE25TheClockKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BatmanTheAnimatedSeriesE25TheClockKing">"The Clock King"</a>, in less than five hours Batman encounters a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb">Time Bomb</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy">Room Full of Crazy</a> Clocks, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BankRobbery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BankRobbery">Bank Robbery</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GasChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GasChamber">Gas Chamber</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>, all designed to keep him busy so the villain can kidnap and kill the mayor.

Cheetah was previously shown flirting with Batman, strongly implying she was the turncoat. However, at the very end of the episode, it turns out that the traitor was Ultra-Humanite, who switched sides after Batman bribed him with a large amount of money that he could use to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">fund his favorite opera company</a>.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> has a vigilante called Rumor kidnapping all of Gotham's supervillains. His high-tech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">Invisibility Cloak</a> was made by a company whose CEO, Paul Karon, was crippled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, speaks approvingly of Rumor's actions and, oh look, is secretly developing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> much like Rumor's that allows him to walk again. Rumor isn't Karon, however&mdash;it's his bodyguard, Mario, who wants to prevent injuries like Karon's from happening in the future (or, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPsychologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPsychologist">Hugo Strange</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">suggests</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">appease his own guilt</a> for failing to protect Karon in the first place).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first episode, Dipper thought Mabel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">boyfriend</a> Norman was a zombie but he was in fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotemPoleTrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotemPoleTrench">a stack of gnomes</a></span>.
</li><li> In the episode "Headhunters", Dipper and Mabel believe that the gossip writer is the killer of wax Stan, when the crime was perpetrated by the vengeful wax statues the real Stan had locked away for years.
</li><li> After having the main characters and audience believe for the entire episode that Old Man McGucket was the author of the journals, it's revealed that he was only an assistant that underwent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>.
</li><li> Across the entire series is the "Zodiac Wheel", a collection of ten symbols on a wheel with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Bill Cipher</a> depicted in the center that flashes at the end of the intro for every episode, and that Bill himself displays during his first appearance. It's revealed in the final episode that bringing the people associated with those symbols together is the key to defeating the demon, but due to Stan and Ford arguing, they aren't able to accomplish the needed ritual before Bill turns everyone who isn't a member of the Pines family into a tapestry. Bill is destroyed by another method, and creator Alex Hirsch would elaborate in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrSTQSh30d8">a DVD commentary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the wheel was originally just intended as a cool image; it was only included in the finale's plot once the writers realized fans had inflated its importance and were expecting some kind of payoff.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Pinkie has been entrusted with guarding a delicious cake that the Cake family is planning to enter in a contest. Early in the episode, Applejack tries to take a bite of the cake but is stopped. Later on, the cake has some bites taken out of it, which Pinkie takes to mean a deliberate act of sabotage by the other competitors. Predictably, given Pinkie's wild accusations, the other competitors turn out to be a red herring. However, Applejack is <em>also</em> a red herring: she tried to take a bite of the cake at the beginning of the episode, but Applejack learned her lesson at that point and she's not the culprit. There are <em>three</em> culprits, and Applejack is <em>not</em> one of them.
</li><li> Near the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> Season 2, the writers began heavily foreshadowing the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Barry Allen</a>, who as comic fans know, famously died while pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">Series Fauxnale</a> presents a similar situation, but when it comes time for said sacrifice, it's actually Wally West, <em>Barry's former sidekick</em>, who ends up dying.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>
<ul><li> We are lead to believe due to the Crystal Gems' own speculation that Peridot arrived on Earth so she could reactivate one of the "Kindergartens" and start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction">Gem production</a> again, which would suck the life from the Earth and doom all living things. Of course, this ignores the fact that, despite constantly interacting and collecting data from the location, she never once tried repairing the deactivated machines that would do just that. The episode "When It Rains" would have her finally explain herself, revealing that her true mission was to monitor the Cluster, a massive artificial Gem superweapon incubating beneath the Earth, which was made from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">the shards of fallen Gems</a>.
</li><li> The death of Pink Diamond. At the end of season three, we're told by several characters that Steven's mother Rose Quartz killed Pink Diamond near the end of the Great Gem War. When Steven gives himself up to Homeworld and goes on trial for his mother's crime at the start of season five, his lawyer realizes that it makes no sense for her to be so easily killed with no witnesses. Steven also later recalls that his mother's sword isn't capable of actually killing Gems, which leads him to the conclusion that it was Pearl who committed the deed, with Rose taking credit for it. This turns out to only be half-right, as "A Single Pale Rose" reveals that while Pearl did do it, Pink Diamond never actually died; Rose Quartz was the war hero alias of the monarch and the "murder" was an excuse to remain in the former role permanently and potentially remove the other Diamonds' desire to continue the war. Which worked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">from a certain point of view</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a>,</em> the episode "Lice Capades" has one built into the structure of the episode: it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy">Clyde</a>, which helps hide the fact that <em>everyone</em> had lice and believed that they were the only one.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Goblin War," Peter's Spider-Sense goes off just as he's about to shake hands with Jason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackCat">Felicia</a>'s fianc&eacute;. He initially thinks it's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheKingpin">Wilson Fisk</a> is in the room, but it later turns out that it went off because Jason is really the Hobgoblin.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> animated series does this with the identity of Phobos' long-lost sister, with some signs pointing to protagonist Will being his sister: her parents are divorced with her father going unmentioned, she's biracial with the same shade of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>, and she's in the correct age range. We learn halfway through the season that his sister is actually Elyon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">a supporting character introduced in the third episode</a> as one of Cornelia's friends. Averted in the comics, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>: in the two-part episode "Ghosts of Geonosis", Ezra, Kanan, Chopper, and Rex go to Geonosis&mdash;whose people are implied to have been wiped out by the Empire&mdash;and find what appears to be the very last Geonosian, who killed every other member of Saw Guerrera's team (who had gone there to investigate earlier) with repaired Separatist droids. The trailers even bring up exactly what the implication of this is: the Geonosian draws a circle within a circle in the dirt to try to explain why it's there and why Saw's men had to be killed, and those familiar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">the second film in the Prequel Trilogy</a> will remember that the Geonosians had a hand in creating the Death Star. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Except it's <em>not</em> about the Death Star, it's an egg, possibly the last one of the entire Geonosian race, and he was just trying to protect it.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>'s episode "Inn Sanity", Eggman finds out that a secret reviewer is going to show up to review his hotel. In a prime example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, a red heron shows up to the desk and introduces himself as "Red Herring", with Eggman assuming he's the secret reviewer. He's not. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(It's Amy)</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StretchArmstrongAndTheFlexFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StretchArmstrongAndTheFlexFighters">Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters</a></em>: When the Flex Fighters attempt to figure out Blindstrike's true identity, they choose as their suspects some male classmates and faculty, who demonstrate remarkable physicality, scientific knowledge, and/or meanness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Instead, Blindstrike becomes revealed as Riya Dashti, the reclusive, Stretch-hating girl, on whom Stretch harbors a crush.</span>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> episode "Detective Mindy" has Mrs. Peterson's sunglasses go missing, and Mitchell, being a detective, naturally tries to find out where his mother's sunglasses went. Mindy, Sean, Sydney, Sunspot, and Jet all get involved in this mystery, too, one by one. Mr. Peterson said the kitchen counter, where Mrs. Peterson lost her sunglasses, was like a black hole, which causes all the kids to believe that the kitchen counter really is a black hole, and they waste their time trying to find an actual black hole. In the end, it is revealed that Mr. Peterson was just using an expression.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vampirina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vampirina">Vampirina</a></em>, Vee gets a visit from the Great Esmeralda, a fortune teller who is never wrong. When she predicts Vee is going to "lose a friend", Vee assumes she and Poppy won't be friends anymore and spends the episode trying to impress her. As it turns out near the end, the friend Vee really lost was her dog Wolfie, who escaped into Poppy's backyard after forgetting to bathe him.

<ul><li> In debating, there is a related trick/fallacy called "Pivoting", where one person will ask a question that can either be answered with one word (such as "no" or "15") or a sentence or two of explanation, such as "because we ran out of money", and instead of answering the other person will go off topic (often rambling at length) to try to get out of answering and in some cases to drag on long enough the other person (and the audience) just forget what the original question was. Unfortunatley, most novice debaters aren't adept enough to recognize this trick and say something like "you're not answering my question, did X happen or didn't it?"
</li><li> In terms of actual mysteries, <a class="urllink" href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888126,00.html">The Phantom of Heilbronn<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was an epic one. From 1993 to 2009, crime scene investigators found DNA samples of the same woman at 40 crime scenes in Germany, Austria, and France. Searches for this mystery killer came up short. Then, someone noticed that all the cotton swabs used for the DNA testing at the crime scenes came from the same shipping. The DNA was then traced to the factory that made the cotton swabs and a worker who accidentally contaminated them.
