Sometimes people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">just disappear</a>, but this is something more.

They never existed. They're not just gone, they're Ret Gone.
</p><p>Of course, it's hard to write stories about people who don't exist, so there is normally at least one person who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">remembers the disappeared character's life</a>. Mostly, this will be someone close to the character, such as a friend or family member (and it's often just one person) who will do their best to find evidence, while convincing themselves and others that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">not crazy</a>.

When she was 4 years old, the boy she loved was abducted by aliens, and everyone, including his parents, forgot he even existed. Micchi somehow retained her memories of what happened, ran away from home, and has spent years travelling through space trying to find some clue to point to her friend's location.

Krillin and Future Trunks knew it wouldn't kill him, but could at least stop him from being born in the present timeline. Strangely enough, when Zamasu was killed in the present, no one brought up that it already failed with Cell. Although Beerus (who killed him) did state that since he was killed by a god, he thought he'd die in the future, you'd think they'd at least mention it.
</li><li> Trunks' timeline is eventually a double subversion of this.

Survivors find that in the new universe, nobody remembers that they ever existed. Those characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are then killed off in the remainder of the book, and promptly forgotten by those few who still remembered them. Ouch.</span>
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s DC work, part of DC's multiverse is Comic Book Limbo, a space where all forgotten comics characters go. As long as they are there, no one will remember them, and everybody will regain their memories about them when writers drag them from this terrible place and put them in their stories.
</li><li> DC's second Chronos removed <em>himself</em> from history, since this was the only way to prevent his adoptive mother being killed in a car crash. Due to the nature of his powers, he continues to exist, but no one remembers him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except his biological father, who remembers him being born and then vanishing.</span>
</li><li> This is one of the higher-end abilities of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>'s Omega Beams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a></em>.
</li><li> Linda Park, the wife of Wally West, the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, was retgonne by a supervillain at her <em>wedding</em>, just before vows were exchanged. The groom found himself at home, confused and vaguely aware that something was missing, but unable to figure out what it was. Eventually (a year and a half later) she was restored to her proper place and the ceremony resumed.
<ul><li> Although Bart Allen (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Impulse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Impulse">Impulse</a>) could still see and remember her. Of course, his grasp on reality is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">little</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">off</a>.

Unfortunately, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Linda both lost a few years of their lives... which included their marriage</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The immortal Hamed Ali was <em>literally</em> erased from existence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan">Animal Man</a></em>. His lines became sketchier, he lost his color, he became nothing more than rough pencil lines and design notes, and disappeared into nothing at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, the need to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valor">Mon-El</a> out &mdash; because he was written out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s existence &mdash; resulted in a confrontation between the Time Trapper and Mon-El. The Time Trapper explained he was behind Mon-El's origin and Mon-El would retroactively cease to exist if he killed him. Mon-El declares that other heroes will arise in his place, and kills him. Fade to white.
<ul><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em> mini-series <em>Legion of Three Worlds</em>, Superboy-Prime meets the Time Trapper in the end, now revealed to be a future, older Prime. Time Trapper makes the mistake of ordering their younger self to kill the Legion. Prime, furious by being ordered around by him, punches the Time Trapper and resulting paradox causes that Time Trapper to cease to exist while Prime is launched back to Earth Prime.

<ul><li> There was a truly heartbreaking Christmas story ("Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot") in a DC Christmas annual a couple years after the Crisis in 1989 where the ghostly superhero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Deadman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Deadman">Deadman</a> is wondering why he bothers going on when a young woman, who can see him, tells him: "We don't do it for the glory. We don't do it for the recognition... We do it because it needs to be done. Because if we don't, no one else will. And we do it even if no one knows what we've done. Even if no one knows we exist. Even if no one remembers we ever existed." Then she disappears into the night, but not before Deadman asks her name. "My name is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Kara</a>. Though I doubt that'll mean anything to you."
</li><li> A later version of the Dark Angel tried to do this to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005">Post-Crisis</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> by trapping her in a horrifying illusion without her knowledge. If Supergirl had mentally, physically, or spiritually broken, Dark Angel would have had the authority to erase her. Supergirl survived the test, but Dark Angel decided to erase her anyway, only to be stopped by her boss, The Monitor.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the origin of Waverider. In a dark future ruled by a tyrant named Monarch, scientist Matthew Ryder time-traveled to the past to defeat him, suffering an accident that turned him into the time-travelling superhero. Waverider ultimately prevented Monarch from conquering the world, but in doing so history was altered, so that Matt Ryder never went to the past and never became Waverider. However Waverider still existed, and eventually joined forces with the Matt Ryder of the new timeline to form the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice">Linear Men</a>.

(In the most recent case, the death of her ex-husband, stepdaughter and infant son, coupled with the loss of her powers). Hippolyta (the Wonder Woman at the time) and her Teen Titans teammate Wally West (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>) remembered her due to being outside the timestream when it was rewritten, and Donna was restored to her previous form, complete with powers (because they used Wally's memories to restore her, and he remembered her best with her Wonder Girl powers).
<ul><li> The tragic part turned out to be that Wally didn't have much memory or knowledge of the (well-written and positive for both of them) relationship she had had with Green Lantern Kyle Rayner before her latest Ret Gone - and so of course she came back with only the vaguest memories of her time with him. Then again, that could just be the writers playing with the readers.

Samaritan has already averted the grim future from which he came, and as a result he was never born (an automated taco stand was built where his house was supposed to be.) Once, Infidel accidentally wrote <em>everything</em> out of continuity except for him and Samaritan, at which point they realized that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoKartingWithBowser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoKartingWithBowser">it was pointless for them to keep trying to kill each other</a>.
<ul><li> In fact, two of the stories featuring Samaritan strongly hint that the reason why he's been obsessively doing good acts ever since the success of his first mission is to make up for deleting the loved ones of his original timeline. Talk about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor's Guilt</a>!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brickleberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brickleberry">Brickleberry</a></em> got cancelled after 3 seasons, the creators failed to find a 4th season on another home channel so they settled on a comic book that focused on Future Steve going back in time to stop alien cows from taking over the earth. In the last issue, Future Steve finally saved the day and helped everyone survive the impending alien cow invasion, but because of this he can't exist anymore.... then only his skin vanishes first! And THEN his muscles! It hurts so much, and he regrets ever saving everyone.
</li><li> Rayek in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a>: Kings of the Broken Wheel</em> wants to take the Palace forward in time and merge it with its former self before it went <em>back</em> in time. This, he claims, will erase the entire history of the elves, trolls and preservers, except for those who happen to be <em>in</em> the Palace when the paradox doesn't happen. Confused? In the event, he does take the Palace forward, leaving behind a whole bunch of elves and trolls who are afraid they'll suddenly cease to exist at some point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Surprise - it doesn't happen. Rayek fails. And then Cutter gets to beat the crap out of him, which Rayek allows to get the ill-feeling out of his system.</span>
</li><li> Implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em>. The Jack of Fables and Fables crossover even has the villain doing this to <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStoryOfLittleBlackSambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStoryOfLittleBlackSambo">The Story of Little Black Sambo</a></em>, after Revise had more or less done this to him by censoring his myth.
<ul><li> As an example of how effective Revise's power could be, the story showed Carl, the fourth little pig who built his house out of cloth. But Revise removed Carl from the story and everyone now thinks there have always been just three little pigs.
</li><li> A further point of this is that at one point the entity called Bookburner puts together an army of fictional characters such as the Comanche Skeleton, Man O' Fruit, Ann O' The Woods, and Lindy Lou the Pragmatic Cat. In-universe these characters and many more were all Fables whose stories were completely forgotten by the Mundy World, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states they were all specifically made up just for the series.

Looking like a man in a trenchcoat with a fedora, it would not only devour a person, but also its entire existence.

</li><li> In an unknown comic (appeared in the Swedish edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePhantom">The Phantom</a></em>): a teenage time traveler is hiding in the present day, trying to avoid futuristic robots that want to kidnap him (because he knows of their existence). When the robots find out where (or rather, when) he is, they try to zap him into their time, but they keep getting the wrong kid... and every time, everyone forgets the victim's existence, as though they never existed. The only ones who remember is the time traveler, and the normal kid protagonist (due to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a>).

It made for an anticlimactic ending, as Shade's personality had come full circle to the socially awkward idealist he was at the beginning, the final page left hanging on his clumsy attempts to reconcile with a woman who no longer had a history with him.
<ul><li> As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueDark">Justice League Dark</a></em>, it didn't work. Shade's creation isn't really Kathy, and Shade has gotten so screwed-up as a result, he's no longer sure if there was <em>ever</em> a real Kathy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> has two examples:
<ul><li> The Brotherhood of Metallix try to do this to Robotnik by stealing the rotten egg out of Kintobor's fridge which meant the accident that turned Kintobor into Robotnik never happened, allowing them to take over the world for themselves, their continued existence being because Grimer was the one who created them, with Robotnik only adding a self-destruct program in case of rebellion. However, Sonic created a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> by retrieving the egg, putting it back in the fridge and then making sure the accident happened, ensuring Robotnik exists.
</li><li> Later on, Robotnik himself absorbs the Chaos Emeralds' power and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">god</a>, using his newfound power to erase Sonic from the timeline and create a new present where he rules and Sonic's pals are either his servants, frightened civilians, or dead. Of course, since, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>, Robotnik only exists <em>because</em> of Sonic, one has to wonder how Robotnik didn't Ret Gone himself as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Not to be outdone, Dr. Eggman attempts this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> storyline "Sonic: Genesis" via the Genesis Wave. However, it turns out that Sonic couldn't be erased and, instead, the universe is altered to be the video game version with SatAM elements in it. As he later reasons, the Genesis Wave's original power source, a singular Chaos Emerald, wasn't enough. Enter...
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide">Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Collide</a></em>, in which Dr. Eggman and Dr. Wily obtain all seven Chaos Emeralds and uses its power to completely alter both Mobius Prime and Earth 20XX. At the end of the story, Mega Man fixes his world, but Eggman interferes in fixing Sonic's, which leads to...
</li><li> ...the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"nu252"</a> universe, which pretty much altered Mobius to the point where it was mostly video game based. Even more, a vast majority of the characters were Ret Gone by the event and the only ones who remember the old world are Eggman, Orbot, Cubot, Naugus, and the Freedom Fighters.
<ul><li> And it's been clarified that those characters have since lost those memories of the old world, so there are no ties to the old continuity. The removed characters have been cut off completely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> also revealed that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> comic continuity was erased by the Super Genesis Wave.

</li><li> The German film <em>Reconstruction</em> does this with the protagonist. After certain point in the narrative, he is erased not only from the memory of his friends and family, but also is left with no home (the house where he lived doesn't properly exist). Obviously, the story becomes highly symbolical after that happens, with the possibility of some, most or all events in his story not being real. One of the most radical possible scenarios is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he doesn't even exist, and is merely a character in a story being written by the husband of the woman he loves.</span> The movie plays with the idea of love itself being an ilusion.

By the end of the movie, the protagonist's family has her committed because of her constant rantings about witnessing the horrible deaths of those closest to her &#151; people that, as far as the family knows, have never existed.
</li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaller">The Caller</a></em> is that Mary, in the present day, mysteriously starts receiving calls from Rose, living in the same apartment four decades earlier. Once Rose becomes jealous enough to start tracking down people close to Mary in her time and killing them, it apparently works this way: To everyone else but Mary, the victims are already long dead, which means if no one else around knew the person in question prior to that point, they won't be remembered by anyone else at all.

However, while <em>actually</em> changing the past is impossible, <em>effectively</em> changing the past by using the Stones to rewind the universe is still theoretically possible.

When it hits you, it kills you in the (recent) past, with the amount of "backburn" being based on the power of the spell. Everything you did in the past few seconds or minutes never actually happened. This affects physical reality but <em>not</em> the memory of those still around to witness the events, leading to much confusion as people <em>remember</em> dying but are clearly not dead.

<ul><li> <em>Redemption Arc</em> shows a variation of this. In both cases, the only person who remembers the missing person being there at the time of the event was there in the room with them. However, these people didn't vanish from time. A look in the records showed that they did exist, but died years earlier and if they hadn't died, they very likely would have ended up working on the project that they are claimed to have vanished during. This implies that the witness, or at least their memories of the person, was transplanted into an alternate universe where that person was already dead.

The only evidence they were ever there at all is the empty clothing and suits of armor left behind. Their method of doing so? All they need is for you to see them, and listen to them for a few seconds, so their words can steal your will to exist away. Or touching them will do that too. Chaos The All-Father was not a nice person, and his creations express this very well.
<ul><li> In a later book, a group of shadow-wights survive by feeding off the memories of a small village, rather then wiping the villagers from existence, allowing the wights to survive indefinitely with their victims none the wiser.
<ul><li> A short story titled, appropriately, <em>Gone</em>, describes the fate of a group of treasure hunters who go to an island populated only by shadow wights hoping to find loot. The story is told by way of a diary, with the author repeatedly getting confused (at one point IN THE MIDDLE OF WRITING AN ENTRY, as the person he was writing about gets erased at that very moment) because his past entries mention people who were never there. The final entry is made by the last survivor, who thinks that the entire diary is actually a work of fiction someone wrote as a present for him.

They have no histories, no traces of evidence, no sign they ever existed. The people they knew still remember them, but there are no physical records of them and their journals serve as the only other proof of existence. Bobby Pendragon gets this in full, including having his house and family vanishing.

The character Saetan wipes out an entire people in response to his son's death. However, an incredibly minor character, an inn owner, remembers that a merchant from that island was there, but him and everything the man had brought with simply weren't there anymore. Also, his wife, Heketeah, the one actually responsible for the death, remembers them and is utterly terrified at the power it takes to simply erase a whole people. Saetan's friend goes to find the island only to find it's completely gone.

For instance, one person who sought it out is mentioned as having gotten enough food to feed his family through hard times, but at the cost of seeing everything upside down. In Dalinar's case, he cannot remember anything about his wife other than the fact that she existed, and can't even hear her name when others speak it.

The protagonist Kirill finds out about this first-hand, when he comes home to find someone else living in his apartment seemingly for years. Even his dog barks at him as if at a stranger. Some people still remember him, but a day later even they have no idea who he is. All his personal effects, such as identification and keys, quickly degrade and turn to dust. He can't even find his birth certificate in the city records. Then people start forgetting him almost as soon as they see him, and some have trouble perceiving him at all. Then he gets a text message to go to a certain address, where his finds his new home and Function, that of a customs officer in Kirill's case. To be more precise, his new home looks like a water tower in our world but is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnBetweenTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnBetweenTheWorlds">Inn Between the Worlds</a> with him beings the custodian.

It soon becomes clear that this has happened several times before - the only person who believes her immediately is a classmate whose troubled reputation stems from a breakdown after his best friend vanished when their car crashed into the same swamp - and towards the climax, the force responsible begins to extend through town, unpersoning people fast and often.

</li><li> A device that does this (the Time-Space Separation Unit, or "Tisser") is the central conceit for the novel <em>War Of Omission</em>, by Kevin O'Donnell Jr. The titular war is what happens when the device gets mass-produced. There is no retconning around the absent people; an example from the book is that if a town's mayor was zapped, the citizens wouldn't ask "where is the mayor?" or even "who's the mayor here?", but "why don't we have a mayor?" Interesting in that not just people and objects, but <em>places</em> are affected &mdash; when someone does it to a diner table, people wonder why the diner has such an awkward corner. Also, the effect is reversable &mdash; the deleted places, people, etc. are stored in the device and can be retrieved at their original locations.

Records, memories and evidence for the existence of an Arcane character slip away from the world, slowly at low levels ("<em>You're easy to forget.</em>") while at high levels people start forgetting you as soon as you leave the room (the five dot version's description is "<em>In other people's minds, you don't even exist.</em>"). Oh, and the stat potentially goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">up to ten</a> for NPCs (and really powerful or unlucky PCs).

It has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a>, in that some of them increased their rating enough to wipe themselves from existence entirely. It is implied that at rank 10, the universe itself forgets you, hence you apply this trope to yourself.
</li><li> According to <em>Guide to the Traditions</em>, this is what happened to the Etherite Czar Vargo when he shattered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> in an attempt to stop the First World War - his act of magic was so public, and so at odds with consensus reality, Paradox retgonne him and his allies out of existence. Worse, the effect was progressive: initially, it was his attempt to stop the war that got retconned, then as time went on it extended backwards through Vargo's timeline to the point that the village he came from ended up never having existed. Some few mage witnesses still remember Vargo, but they get fewer and fewer as time passes and the Paradox effect gets to them. (Related to the note above, a sidebar comments that the Technocracy, whatever else it's capable of, couldn't manage to Ret Gone an event on that scale itself, as it's not that powerful. Paradox <em>is</em>.)
</li></ul></li><li> In a book on magic for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, there is a spell that erases the memories of a person or object from existence completely. However, a character's connections can help them resist, on the principle that it gets harder to make everyone and everything "forget". Also, trying to remove important or big things won't work completely, as the universe will try to fit something else in the hole. For example, if a building in the middle of town is erased from existence, you won't end up with an empty lot; something has to go there, so some other building will appear.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Excrucians</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Nobilis</a></em> aim to do this to all of creation, one aspect at a time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Nobles</a> can, themselves, to a more limited extent, make retroactive changes to physical existence and history. A minor element of the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> speaks of the five hundred years of human progress which got unmade, changing history considerably.

</li><li> The D20 setting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infernum">Infernum</a></em> incorporates Ret Gone into its background; get swallowed by a Hellgout (a kind of naturally occuring portal that links Hell and Earth, which usually ends up acting like a black hole) and Earth will basically rewrite itself to wipe out your existence, with any remaining hints that you ever existed being subtle ones, a process referred to in-universe as "The Twisting". For example, the Knights of the Harrowing are the descendents of an order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">overzealous</a> Christian Crusaders called the Knights of the Sepulchre, an order dedicated to the reclaimation of the tomb where Jesus Christ resided for three days after being crucified, who deliberately invoked a Hellgout to swallow their fortress so they could lead a crusade against Hell. The vast majority of the deeds they accomplished have either been erased from history, or attributed to other orders. A rare few examples of their symbol, a charging crusader on horseback, are occasionally found on crumbling ruins in either the Holy Land or south France.

To recreate the population, they first resurrected the Empress, then everyone the Empress remembered, then everyone <em>they</em> remembered, and so on. Many isolated villages and antisocial individuals were omitted from the restored Alphatia, as none of the Alphatians who <em>did</em> get restored had missed their presence. For them, being forgotten became the <em>cause</em> of non-existence, rather than the effect.

From a single person to an entire species or continent the Uncreation spell completly stops it from ever having existed at all, with the timeline changing to match.

It was described as a new game mechanic, weapons that literally do 1 million times the damage of regular weapons in the game. The writer suggested that one way to handle this is to have any normal item hit by a Giga-Damage weapon is not only vaporized, but never existed at all. He goes on to explain how he used a Giga-Damage weapon in his game to destroy a piece "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChristopherColumbus">of the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria</a>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0iq6c');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0iq6c" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0iq6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> No, that wasn't written wrong.

Of course, the fact that said writer is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> idiot was a running gag throughout the book</span> and that is how he was able to become the Overlord of Illinois.

Demons typically use Pacts to gain "Cover" &mdash; metaphysical pieces of their human personas. When they make a Pact, parts of a human's life is literally removed and cosmically retconned into belonging to the Demon instead &mdash; from a simple memory or skill to physical attributes or even relatives. And then there's the ultimate pact: the soul. If a Demon takes a person's entire soul as their payment, that person is <em>gone</em>. The gamebook differentiates this from a disguise or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, the original person has been retconned out, with the Demon claiming their entire <em>existence</em> as its own Cover.
<ul><li> People who live in one of the contained, fragmented versions of Seattle detailed in the main DtD book experience a different version: if they make a stigmatic pact with a demon, they are pushed farther and farther out of existence each time the fragment resets. A father of two sons will, after one reset, become an <em>uncle</em> with two nephews, then a distant relation, then a complete stranger, then *poof* gone unless they escape to the "real" Seattle in time.

And then later, on the final day, Roxas finds that not only has time stopped again, but all those same photos no longer have him in them.
<ul><li> The Roxas situation has an even odder example of how the trope works, as the real Twilight Town serves as a 'world without Roxas' look at the Twilight Town inside the simulation - even though we know that the TT Roxas was in wasn't real, it feels to the players like Roxas has been Ret Gone'. It gets even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwy</a> when it appears as though data! has affected the real world - the Usual Spot gang coming to see Sora off for almost no reason - and Sora experiences Roxas' pain at <em>being</em> Ret Gone', without actually knowing why, seeming to play this trope straight, though in a non-standard way.

When they return to the present, the war was never lost, Einstein never existed, and there is no nuclear technology. Only the three Soviets who travelled back are aware of the changes. The events of <em>Red Alert 2</em> were completely erased. Of course Hitler, having previously been retgonne by Einstein, stayed retgonne.

It has several names and variations (the "Psijic Endeavor" championed by the ancient Chimeri prophet Veloth and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Tribunal deity</a> Vivec, the idea of "Ehlnofic Annulment" championed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTheocracy">Alessian Order</a>, etc.) but each, essentially, teaches that mortals can "observe the entirety of the universe" (ie, realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">they are in a video game</a>) and then accomplish one of three things. The first is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">CHIM</a>, where one becomes aware of this nature, exists as one with it, and maintains a sense of individuality. (Vivec hints at this in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel">36 Lessons</a></em> book series and outright claims to have achieved this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">developer written</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon">supplemental works</a>.) The second is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">Amaranth</a>, where one exits this universe to create one's own. The third, which occurs if one fails to maintain their individuality in either step, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">Zero-Sum</a>, where one experiences the "extreme" version of this trope, ceasing to be and fading into the universe as if you never were. (Note that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonindicativeName">despite the name</a>, the Psijic Endeavor has nothing to do with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety">Psijic Order</a>.

It also ends up in a semi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a>: the Lich turned out to be the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">devastating weapon</a>, and an alternate version of him popped up anyway as that timeline's Jake (while that timeline's Finn became the Ice King)&mdash;which was the result of Prismo's wishes having an ironic twist (in this case, the Lich never existed <em>until now</em>). Main Timeline! undoes the trope by using his own wish to retcon the Lich's wish into sending Finn and Jack home, meaning Finn never had to make his wish.

When Ezra Bridger <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gains access to the titular realm inside the Jedi temple on Lothal</span>, he possibly saves Ahsoka from this by discovering a time portal that shows what happened immediately after he managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS2E20TwilightOfTheApprenticePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS2E20TwilightOfTheApprenticePartII">escape the collapsing Sith temple on Malachor a few years prior, with she and Vader trapped inside.</a> Seeing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vader was winning the duel and had just enough time to strike her down before the temple collapsed, Ezra decides to pull her into the world between worlds, preventing her from being killed so that she would have a chance to exist in his current time</span>. After telling her how much he missed her and explaining what happened while she was gone, Ezra then realizes that he has the power to "go back and change things" here and wishes to use it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">undo the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> of his master, Kanan</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em>, the Shredder's plan to destroy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a> resulted in several characters being erased from existence, literally, as the plot came to fruition, including April and Casey. Ironically, it happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Hun</a> just as the Turtles convinced him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn">to turn against the Shredder.</a> Fortunately, April and Casey were restored once the plan was stopped, and presumably, everyone else was.
</li><li> In the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack's fiance Ashi ceases to exist after he travels back to his time and defeats her father Aku</span>. This is only a mild case as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">he still possesses memories of her</a> as indicated by his smile when he sees the ladybug. This is also definitely the case with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Future Aku, since his erasure is what erases Ashi, as well as the evil cult that worshipped him</span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not only her, the entire future timeline and everyone and everything in it ceases to exist</span> as it was a distorted reality created by the act of Aku banishing Jack into the future. Jack returning to the past <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> resets this distortion and the timeline essentially proceeds as it would have had Jack never travelled to the future, even though his memories and experience remain.</span>
</li><li> All of Jack's friends from future <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> would have been Ret Gone along with Ashi as killing Aku means that he couldn't kill or displace human populations for the next several millennia, nor be able to invite various alien races to Earth, thus negating them from being born. Even if they still exist under a happier future, none of them will remember ever meeting Jack; even though he's a legendary hero now, all those events he took part in never happened. The only one who'll remember these events is Jack himself, unless he somehow decides to chronicle his adventures.</span> There is a silver lining to this: they would never have had to experience the living hell that was Aku.
</li></ul></li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MastersOfTheUniverse">Masters of the Universe</a></em> sketch, Skeletor goes back in time to prevent He-Man from being born, but the spell he used turns him into a baby. He's taken in by King Randor and takes the opportunity to kill him and his mistress. Unfortunately, it turns out the mistress was Skeletor's mother and Randor was his illegitimate father, so Skeletor is erased from existence instead.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers">Captain Planet and the Planeteers</a></em> episode "Future Shock" had three villains descended from Looten Plunder, Dr. Blight, and Verminous Skumm sent back in time by Zarm to secure their future by killing a girl who would grow up to be a prominent defender of the environment. In the end, the three villains screw up and fire at Ma-Ti by mistake. While Ma-Ti survives, the failure to kill the little girl causes the Eco-Villains' descendants to disappear because of their timeline never transpiring.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>, the botched opening of a portal between dimensions starts to destroy the universe in which the series takes place, erasing not only space but time as well as such that certain events never happened. Naturally, characters slowly end up having this happen to them as a result, having never existed and being forgotten by most characters. For one character it's a lot worse, only having half their body erased; they survive, but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">horrific results</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Trapper Keeper", a cyborg who calls himself <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a></em> comes from the future to destroy Cartman's trapper keeper. The episode ends with the trapper keeper destroyed causing him to fade away, having fulfilled his purpose.
</li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfSonicTheHedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>'s Chaos Emerald Saga, Sonic's desire for a chili dog in ancient Egypt prevents his ancestors from meeting, leading to him being erased from existence.
