<ul><li> Seto Kaiba from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> gets away with a <em>lot</em> because of his wealth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">The trope name</a> comes from a line (quoted above) in the first episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em>, which parodies this. In fact, both the line and the concept are running jokes throughout the (abridged) series.
<ul><li> Also in the same episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: I'm going to hire some thugs to kidnap you now. I'm a billionaire, so nobody will even think of pressing charges.
</div></li><li> And from the YGOTAS flashback episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics">My affluence makes a nonsense of the regulations</a>!
</div></li><li> Kaiba also uses this trope when he narrates over a flashback of his days in an orphanage:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: It was a very depressing time in my life, since I didn't have any money, so I was unable to screw the rules.
</div></li><li> The joke is then reversed in the YGOTAS movie, naming another trope in the process:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">Screw the Money, I Have Rules!</a>... Wait, let me try that again.
</div></li><li> Then later brought back in the form of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> one-liner meme:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: Looks like the rules <em>(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassesPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassesPull">puts on shades</a>)</em> just got screwed!
</div></li><li> Another episode shows Kaiba doesn't have much care for the Christmas Season either.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Kaiba</strong>: Screw the Yules, I have money!
</div></li><li> He messes up the line even more here while trying to remember his first duel with Yugi (but he was on drugs at the time, so you can't blame him):
<div class="indent"><strong>Flashback Kaiba</strong>: Screw the rules, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhFirstAnimeSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhFirstAnimeSeries">I</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">have</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">green</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDyeJob">hair!</a>
</div></li><li> In the second Season Zero Abridged episode, it becomes subverted:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: Actually, there are several situations in which summoning multiple monsters at once can be considered totally legal in this game. <br><strong>Yami</strong>: That...that wasn't very funny. <br><strong>Kaiba</strong>: Why would it be funny? I'm just trying to explain how to play.
</div></li><li> And apparently, Seto actually got it from his adoptive father.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Gozaburo</strong>: Screw the rules, Seto, I have <em>your</em> money!
</div></li><li> Lector gets a shot at turning this on its head.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lector</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal">It looks like the rules just screwed you!</a>
</div></li><li> Pegasus is also proficient at this, even if it's not as memey as Kaiba's.
<div class="indent"><strong>Yugi</strong>: <em>[after Pegasus bribes him to a tournament with his grandpa's soul]</em> It's too bad rich megalomaniacs are immune from the law; otherwise, we could just call the police.
</div></li><li> Even Joey gets one in.
<div class="indent"><strong>Joey</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatCameOutWrong">Screw my sister</a>, I have money!
</div></li><li> The actual anime's English dub has a line very close to the trope namer during a duel when Kaiba plans to use Chaos Emperor Dragon's special ability:
<div class="indent"><strong>Siegfried</strong>: There's one problem &mdash; you need to give up 1,000 of your Life Points first, and you can't afford that now. <br><strong>Kaiba</strong>: There's <em>nothing</em> I can't afford! <em>[plays "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">Emergency Provisions</a>"]</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JojosBizarreAdventureAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JojosBizarreAdventureAbridged">If someone else does it in another series, Kaiba will allow that person to be beaten up.</a>
<div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba</strong>: Kick his ass, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure">Jotaro</a>.
</div></li><li> The Season Zero Abridged Movie (known as the second abridged movie) also subverts this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Yami</strong>: Wait a minute, did you just summon a bunch of mon- <br><strong>Kaiba</strong>: <em>[interrupts]</em> Yes, I summoned them all in one turn. Stop asking!
</div></li><li> There's also one instance from the "Waking The Dragons" filler arc in the actual anime, where Kaiba and Mokuba get a car and write a 500,000 dollar check for it before driving it out of the lot, over the salesman's protests.
<ul><li> In the abridged equivalent of the same episode, the check now reads, "All of Joey Wheeler's money". Even the rules of money are not safe from Kaiba's screwing.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div>

<ul><li> Manjoume/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Chazz Princeton</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> indulged in this trope prior to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, as this conversation from this English dub shows:
<div class="indent"><strong>Chazz:</strong> No one calls Chazz Princeton a coward! <br><strong>Foster:</strong> Talk is cheap, young duelist. <br><strong>Chazz:</strong> That may be, but I'm rich! And I'll spend whatever it takes to be the best out there! <br><strong>Foster:</strong> Ha-ha, that's just your problem &mdash; no amount of money can <em>buy</em> you that. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">You must earn it</a>... if you can.
</div><ul><li> And as a video showed, by Season 3, it seemed the GX writers were deliberately tossing in jokes in the vein of <em>The Abridged Series</em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ojama Yellow:</strong> Take it, easy boss, you'll pop a blood vessel! <br><strong>Chazz:</strong> I don't care! I'll just BUY a new one!

</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PS238" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PS238">PS238</a></em>. The Revenant, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, has not only one but several wealthy cover identities in order for him to integrate into civilian society. Most of said cover identities are on various state wanted lists for tax evasion charges, because The Revenant only pays taxes for one of them. He's also said that he thinks that having money might actually be the greatest superpower of them all.
</li><li> Shows up at the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blacksad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blacksad">Blacksad</a></em> premiere album "Somewhere within the Shadows".

Blacksad rejects him again and makes a point of defying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Statoc</span>'s attempt to invoke this trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Batman RIP</a>: The Black Glove mock Batman saying that there is no court they cannot bribe and that they have even more money than him.

</li><li> Should he get caught in an illicit activity without a backup plan to get him out of it, Oswald Cobblepot aka the Penguin usually either bribes the corrupt Gotham police force or relies on his lawyers to get him out of it, much to Batman's frustration.
<ul><li> Though this is a definite case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>; other comics depict Batman as considering the Penguin such a valuable informant that he doesn't really bother investigating the Iceberg Lounge's illegal dealings <em>too</em> closely.

They tend to be one-shot characters because they appear in the issue Diabolik robs them, and in the process tends to expose their crimes beyond their abilities to pay their way out of trouble, bankrupt them, kill them (the usual end), or any combination of the three.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AddamsFamilyReunion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AddamsFamilyReunion">Addams Family Reunion</a></em>, the family is mistakenly invited to another family's reunion, and when it looks like the eccentric billionaire grandfather is going to leave his money to the Addamses instead of his greedy relatives, the rich family reports Gomez and Morticia to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">Department of Child Disservices</a>, steals Wednesday and Pugsley away, buries Lurch alive, and has Fester thrown in an insane asylum.

On the other hand, his attempts to bribe the FBI agent investigating him fall flat, and his attempts to subvert the system (he wears a wire on his partners in return for a shorter sentence but attempts to inform them of it), wind up busting him even further and sending him to prison. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But then it turns out the prison he's going to is a minimum-security, white-collar prison designed for people of his wealth, and he's out in three years, promptly going back to a life of making money (albeit less so than before). It's up to the viewer if the experiences of the film made him really repent, or if he's still the same selfish monster and only became a functioning addict and isn't attracting Federal heat anymore.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em> is largely based on an urban legend retelling of how streetcars ended their run during the 20th century. The story goes that major auto and tire manufacturers (Ford, Chrysler, Firestone, et al), fearful that efficient public transit would keep people from buying their products, would buy up streetcar companies around the country and then liquidate them, effectively destroying a profitable mode of transportation for the American public. In reality, these companies were bought as investments/hedges, and only liquidated once they became unprofitable. The legend further states that the companies only paid a minimum fine for these anti-trust practices. In reality, the fines involved were for monopolizing the sale - not the operation - of buses. See <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy">the Wikipedia entry<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for more.

Also, earlier in the film, he is shown obtaining luxury items for himself through the black market.

<ul><li> House Lannisters (each branch thereof) firmly believes that throwing money at a problem will certainly either fix it or, at the very least, shut it up. But, those who throw good money after bad (like Tywin's father or Cersei tried) find this not to be true. Most spend their money and monitor it working for for them. It mostly works out.

This comes from the fact that he was caught red-handed in the middle of the Department of Mysteries in the company of other Death Eaters.

</li><li> Flinx, of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> series, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> user of this trope, thanks to having some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> rig his bank account (as a favor). He mainly uses it to bribe his way around the Commonwealth, but loses some of that advantage after coming to the attention of the peaceforcers on Terra in <em>Reunion</em>. It's also subverted in <em>Flinx Transcendent</em>, where passing counterfeit AAnn currency on Blasusarr is what blows his cover.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></em>. Inverted in that the strikers are punished <em>because</em> they make money; subverted when Hank's Rearden's money fails to protect him during his divorce trial; played straight when Rearden is allowed to buy resources and sell his products how he wishes, despite legally binding orders to the contrary.

Mordred argues with Arthur that their judicial system - two champions jousting, on behalf of the defendant and prosecution - was unfair since it was more of a battle of muscles. Arthur pointed out that the law allowed for each party to hire whomever they liked to be their champion and pointed out that if they switched to using lawyers, it would just be the same (each party could hire whichever lawyer they thought would best save their bacon). He finishes by pointing out that in the judicial system, whoever has the most money will most likely win.

Prosecutor Jack Emery in <em>Weekend Warriors</em> did express hatred for how rich people think they're above the law, and brings that up in <em>Free Fall</em>. He does have a point, considering how a number of bad guys have money at their side and have used it to keep themselves protected.
</li><li> <em>The Appeal</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGrisham">John Grisham</a>: The main stockholder for a NYC chemical plant is looking to reverse a $41 million judgement.

After centuries of living as what amounts to murderous nocturnal bandits, they learned in the Age of Discovery that they could pay humans for well-guarded rooms to sleep in&mdash;or to take their money and do things with it to make even more money. They became significant shareholders in the assorted East India companies, and eventually invented modern corporate culture. Getting the law to regard corporations as legal citizens was one of their favorite jokes, in fact&mdash;a soulless, insatiably demanding entity with the rights of a human being? They were guffawing about that one for years...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesofGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesofGrey">Christian Grey</a> has this mindset. Buying the publishing house where his then-ex Ana works, bribing a senator to ensure a crate gets shipped to Darfur, involuntarily committing an unstable former submissive and buying Elena Lincoln's ex-husband's business for the sole purpose of bankrupting him as revenge certainly count, especially since most of these would have either not been possible or would have gotten him thrown in jail in the real world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMigaxCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMigaxCycle">The Migax Cycle</a></em>, Summer doesn't even try to sue Sylas for damages to her apartment, because she knows he'll be able to pay his way out of it.

It's so commonplace that officials are routinely "tipped" just for doing their jobs <em>right</em>&mdash;presumably there's always a way to screw you over if you're stingy. When someone well-liked goes to prison, communities will pass the hat because if the guards aren't paid enough there are beatings and worse in store. You can't even reliably identify the "good guys" as the ones who can't be bribed, which contributes to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a> of the story.

A good example of this came from Russel Winters, who used Wolfram and Hart to help him get around rules both legal, such as "don't eat young women", and supernatural, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustBeInvited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustBeInvited">being unable to enter homes without an invitation</a>.

</li><li> They also used a straight example once, with an obscenely rich matriarch of a wealthy family of Kennedy expies - Castle himself pointed out that while he was rich, his money went into banks, while her money <em>bought</em> banks. So rich was she that one of her employees was a 'fixer' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who arranged for the cold-blooded killing of a woman who was the daughter to one of her sons, had an innocent man sent to jail in his place, and eventually not only had the man killed in prison but personally killed a bike messenger who was delivering evidence to the cops to clear the man's name</span>. And all the while, she was more concerned about a missing ring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that said fixer had stolen to help pay off the man in jail</span>. Her relatives, thankfully, are nowhere near that bad.
</li><li> Subverted in an episode where Castle tells a Homeland Security guy that he has the Governor of New York on speed dial and threatens to call him. Later, the Fed tells Castle that he's spoken with the Governor, and the guy has never heard of Rick Castle (which is strange, given that Castle is a best-selling author).

In one episode, he gets away with murder because he only ordered the murder and didn't actually do anything to convict himself. He's also not afraid to stick it to other casino guys from time to time, although not actually ordering any of them killed.

This is implied to be a philosophy of Tywin Lannister's in particular, and also Tyrion Lannister's. Like father, like son. Tyrion's go-to solution in problematic situations is to attempt to buy his way out. However, his particular skill is offering money in a charismatic and audacious way, which allows him to win the loyalty of those he pays off. Even the lower Westerlands Houses can get in on this considering the Lannister fortunes have enriched almost every noble house of the region. However, it can and has backfired spectacularly when the target decides that they're insulted by the idea of being bought by some rich snot. Come Season 4 though, they're running on the <em>idea</em> that they're <em>still</em> rich...

She finally blurts it to the cops only to have them let Double-G off with a warning because of his celebrity status...while Bey is under arrest for failing to report and being an accessory. Bey actually says she's okay with it as she wants to show respect and how the law doesn't play favorites. At which point, Double-G gives the cops two front row tickets for his concert to let her go and Bey just throws up her hands.

Eventually, when even House can't figure out how to save his son, the man acknowledges that he's been practicing this trope all his life and blames the fact that his wife is dead and his son dying on "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">the karma</a>", and tries to reverse it by giving up his entire fortune. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The kid <em>does</em> get better...but the idiot still lost almost everything. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a>...</span>

Invoked heroically yet again when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">uses his money to set up a civil law division so his clients can have access to appropriate legal support after their criminal cases</span>.
</li><li> The Graysons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge">Revenge</a></em> seem to live on this trope. Watching their every attempt to invoke this blow up in their faces is...satisfying.

Being born in '86 and watching SBTB growing up, Zack was the only one I saw with a mobile phone in the '90s AND I think his dad was a lawyer...I always thought it was a big plothole in that Zack was obsessed with becoming rich!

When you're halfway up the mountain to it, you'll receive a message from the enemy: "Attention mercenary. Whatever the Snakes are paying you, we'll double it. Just turn around and go back to your dropship." You can take the offer if you'd like, which results in you getting double the cash that the base contract offers but eliminates the chance of procuring salvage (you also have to fight your employer's two somewhat tough mechs instead of the enemy's four less tough mechs, though you can also take advantage of the fact that they don't turn hostile until you either cross a certain point on the map or kill one of them).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrange">Life Is Strange</a></em>, the first episode implies the Prescotts, by virtue of their wealth, own the town and the cops, and if you tell the headteacher you saw their son waving a gun around, he finds it hard to believe and it's implied he merely scolds the boy. Worse still, the school is obviously a rich kid school, and the headteacher comes down harder on you for being a scholarship student.
</li><li> Jorji Costava of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PapersPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PapersPlease">Papers, Please</a></em> attempts to bribe the inspector to allow him into Arstotska, and no matter how many times he's detained he always pops back up within a few days, having paid off the police to let him free.

The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Butch Hartman</a> was picked on by rich kids in high school has <em>absolutely nothing</em> to do with the character's horribly exaggerated portrayal, really. To be fair, he was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> when it was revealed that his parents constantly ignore him and he antagonizes Timmy because he's jealous of the fact that Timmy has both a set of loving parents (well, more loving than Remy's, at least) and Fairy Godparents. As the series went on, Remy's actions seemed to have less to do with his family issues and more to do with Remy just acting like a douche for no reason. Hell, even before we found out about his parents he was like that, where he bought every ticket to the new Crash Nebula movie <em>just for his piles of money</em>.
</li><li> Timmy, meanwhile, may have an infinite amount of magical wishes at his fingertips, but he actually <em>doesn't</em> have infinite magical wealth at his fingertips, as shown in one episode where he wishes for a large sum of money so he can get tickets to a concert, only to find out that it's against the rules; fairies can't grant any wishes that break the law, and magically creating money would require either stealing or counterfeiting.

<ul><li> Ed Wuncler III, whose grandfather owns everything in town and will never be arrested or prosecuted for anything. Riley even said "you're lucky your granddad owns the police" after a badly botched bank robbery. Ed's partner Gin Rummy denied it works that way and claimed they got away with it "because I am a criminal mastermind"... right before a cop comes by <em>to return Ed's wallet from the scene of the crime</em>.
</li><li> His grandfather Ed I isn't much better. In one episode, he converts a health food restaurant into a soul food restaurant (firing all the employees except the illegal Mexicans in the process) in order to drive down property values in the area and convince the city to sell him a public park. In another episode, he uses a pony (which may not actually ever have existed) as leverage to perform a hostile takeover of Jazmine's lemonade stand.
<ul><li> He takes it pretty far when he tries to KILL a man so he can profit from his death. He intended to have his building blow up with the security guard inside and orchestrate it as a terrorist attack. He believed that, like the 9/11 attacks, the nation would come together and mourn and he'd be able to sell memorial items praising the guard as a hero. This trope is directly (and hilariously) lampshaded in the following exchange:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Jack Flowers</strong>: Look, Huey, nobody is above the law. Wuncler is going to pay for this.

In fact, about the only thing he can't buy is the Green Bay Packers. (Points to him for actually trying, but the city refused to sell the team to him.) And Maddie. Or Danny. He can't buy Danny's love (No, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">THAT kind of love</a>, sorry Vlad/Danny shippers) either.
</li><li> David Xanatos of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>. His introduction to viewers included the phrase "Pay a man enough and he'll walk barefoot into hell." The guy owns everything, all the shiny toys, all the best lawyers, everything. A fan joke is that Xanatos is so rich, he could afford to pay all the people necessary to say "hell" in a children's cartoon series. A DISNEY children's cartoon series, no less.
<ul><li> However, part of his character development is the realization that not everything can be solved by money and manipulation.
<ul><li> For example, he can't buy his way out of a prison sentence for receiving stolen property.
</li><li> He did get the sentence shortened to a month. When he should have been in prison for years for orchestrating the entire theft.

The villain in the episode was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOldFolks">old miser</a> who had built a device that would send his wealth to the afterlife, in effect, allowing him to take it with him. ("I didn't spend my whole life becoming rich just to leave it all to charity!" he rants.) Naturally, he doesn't give a damn about the adverse effects the device will have on the environment; and this isn't a case of a villain just not <em>knowing</em> it's dangerous either, he made sure that <em>he</em> was well protected. When the machine causes an endless mob of ghosts to spill out and Egon discovers that it will cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, the heroes are forced to confront him and fool him into taking himself out.
</li><li> The Ghostbusters' smarmy, filthy rich, smug rival Paul Smart from the episode "Robo Buster" also acted like he was above the law (ex. stealing the Ghostbusters' weapon designs with no qualms or consequences) and got away with it until his flawed ghostbusting robot put the entire city in danger.

Similarly, he takes Linda for a date to an amusement park owned by his parents and inexplicably seems to win all the time (the employees are threatened with being fired if he ever loses).

This resulted in millions of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_AK-47_and_M16">AK-47s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and other weaponry being sold on the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_market">grey market<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market">black market<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. And not just weapons - under the 'economic liberalization' program advocated by Western nations and agencies, and required for the post-Soviet nations to get loans, whole factories and industries were sold off to wealthy people who took them apart for parts and grew insanely rich, earning the name of 'oligarchs'.
<div class="indent">Everything the Soviets ever told us about Communism was a lie. Unfortunately, everything they told us about capitalism was true. &mdash; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianHumour">Russian joke</a></em>
</div></li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.amazon.com/Russians-People-behind-Gregory-Feifer/dp/1455509647">this book<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, pretty much everything in Russia runs on bribes.
<ul><li> For a specific example, you know most of the dash-cam videos on Youtube come from Russia or the former Soviet bloc? It's to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCops">Corrupt Cops</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-russian-drivers-have-dash-cams-2012-12">from accepting bribes in a car accident<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It's more cost-effective (not to mention reliable) to shell out some money for a dash-cam rather than get hit with a fraudulent lawsuit because the other driver could pay off the cop. Surprisingly, higher-education and <em>kindergartens</em> are on-par with this instance.
</li></ul></li><li> Defectors have used bribe money to escape <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a> and/or convince North Korean officials to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice">ignore black market deals</a>. Bribery became very common after North Korea's economy started to fail when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> ended. North Korea depended on foreign aid to keep its economy intact. When Russia and China began to charge higher prices for petroleum and other supplies, the infrastructure suffered a breakdown that became worse after the famine. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire">Bribe Backfire</a> can instantly apply if the bribe threatens the North Korean official with public exposure.
<ul><li> This also has applied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a>. Bribes are paid so black market operations will be ignored.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Philippines</a>, a bribe can do practically anything to circumvent petty traffic laws and bureaucratic red tape, to the point where politicians and policemen are nearly always depicted as crocodiles, eager to swallow up more cash. It works the other way around too - come campaign season, expect to see vote-buying on a scandalous scale.
</li><li> This is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in some urban areas of Thailand. It's not as bad now as it used to be, but at its peak, bribery happened in every walk of life on every rung of the social ladder. This is most evident with traffic tickets, where you immediately pay the fine, which is essentially a bribe to the officer equal to the price of the fine. This traffic-based bribery was so rampant in the '90s that traffic cops would avoid pulling over any motorists who looked western, because they knew these people were more likely to pay the ticket as normal (either because they didn't understand the bribery system, they were morally against it, or they came from a country where bribing of police officers was not common), meaning the officers wouldn't get as much money and were thus wasting their time.
</li></ul></li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> example was Rome: an interesting example of this trope is that in the Roman Republic, there was a fixed fine for assault, which was not adjusted for inflation, and after several centuries of currency debasement, the fine was worthless. Rich sociopaths used to walk down the street punching people in the face and then handing over purses full of small change; legally, this was adequate compensation and the victims couldn't bring charges.
<ul><li> Although it makes one wonder why said victim couldn't simply punch them back and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">return the purse...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Related to the above, fines in <em>general</em>. Because fines may be fixed, what may be an "ouch" to a working-class citizen may be mere pocket change to someone with more wealth. For that matter, a lot of lawsuits in general against corporations tend to not hurt them because a couple hundred thousand dollars in legal fees and fines is merely pocket change. Some industries in fact simply find it <em>cheaper</em> to pay fines instead of following the law. This is partly why criminal penalties exist. With the difference in outcomes for people who can hire high priced attorneys, this is tragically becoming an example of the trope as well.
<ul><li> This is why punitive damages exist in torts in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCommonLaw">The Common Law</a>. It's easy to get worked up about jury judgments in the millions of dollars against defendants in (for instance) product liability cases, but you have to realize that the <em>point</em> of allowing punitive damages is to make it so that large corporations actually feel the bite when they hurt people.
</li><li> Averted by Finnish and German traffic laws, which base fines on offenders' income in order to make sure they hurt a rich person as much as they would a poor person.
</li><li> Disneyland California evidently pays a fine every night for their fireworks performance(s).
<ul><li> Walt Disney World in Florida does not... because they own so much of the land, they <em>are</em> the government, right up to the county level.
</li></ul></li><li> Oddly enough, this is the point of Islamic law's prescription of cutting off a hand as punishment for theft. Today, most of the world finds this barbaric, but it made a great deal of sense in seventh-century Arabia: they couldn't really afford to imprison anyone<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zpbg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1zpbg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zpbg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is why Islamic law has rules regulating but not forbidding slavery&mdash;remember that slavery in ancient and medieval societies was a way to deal with prisoners of war. The early Muslims took POWs as slaves because the state couldn't afford to run POW camps; indeed, the idea of a POW camp would have been rather alien to a 7th-century person even of a culture that probably could afford to incarcerate POWs.</span> but obviously imposing a fine for theft would mean that the punishment would be disproportionally harsh to the poor. Losing a hand, though? Even rich people would hate to part with a hand.
</li><li> The Pinto was designed as an economical choice for lower-income drivers, but it was later revealed that the Pinto had a defect in the gas tank that could cause it to burst into flames in even low-speed rear-end collisions. According to leaked document dubbed "The Ford Pinto Memo," Ford greenlit the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=1">Pinto <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> while knowing about the design flaws; the legal damages they would have to pay <em>on average</em> was cheaper than going back and fixing all the existing cars and manufacturing methods and the expected costs of legal expenses from people who were injured or killed as a result of the defect. A combination of public backlash and actual costs changed their minds.
</li><li> Marshawn Lynch, running back for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">Seattle Seahawks</a>, wears Skittles-colored shoes that are against NFL regulations. However, Skittles is more than happy to pay the fines for him, since it's chump change for their marketing department. Lynch, for his part, gets a Skittles vending machine in his locker, which works out as he's addicted to the candies. Lynch was also famous for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSilentBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSilentBob">The Silent Bob</a> and paying fines instead of having to talk to the press.

Some examples:
<ul><li> Boss Tweed ran Tammany Hall in the 1870s and decided to avert being clever by getting massive amounts of money, and then just liberally bribing everyone who could conceivably get in the way. Why be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">sophisticated</a> about your crimes when you can just make a lot of money? He was only undone when a pesky muckraker with a sense of morals decided to bring him down.
</li><li> The entire railroad industry was owned by the Vanderbilts, one of whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">allegedly</a> said "Public be damned!" They would organize their railroads based on whoever could offer enough money and could force prices up at a whim. The government didn't act out against them until antitrust legislation was finally introduced over a decade after they gained power.
</li></ul></li><li> Steve Jobs had a tendency to drive without a license plate and park (crookedly) in handicap spaces, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cultofmac.com/steve-jobs-still-parking-in-handicapped-spaces-the-pictures/2613">and get away with it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2xldc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2xldc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2xldc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It may have been his building, but handicapped spaces are protected by State and Federal law</span>.

</li><li> Season ticket holders for major league sports teams can have arena giveaway items mailed to them; those with club seats at indoor arenas can have their food brought to them. Many teams also offer early arena entry, priority playoff seating, etc.
</li><li> While today the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a> lobbying is very public and spendful, the book <em>Pictures at a Revolution</em> shows that in the 1960s, it was much easier to manipulate the Academy when it was half the size it was today - and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a>'s case, when many of the voters are in your payroll. Fox got Best Picture noms for unremarkable films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSandPebbles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSandPebbles">The Sand Pebbles</a></em> and outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">bombs</a> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cleopatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle">Doctor Dolittle</a></em> (which, as told in the book, the studio held 16 days with free screenings with dinner for Academy members).
<ul><li> The bribery didn't stop with Fox. Universal also used expensive dinners to bribe Oscar voters to nominate their flop <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnneOfTheThousandDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnneOfTheThousandDays">Anne of the Thousand Days</a></em> for the major awards (it only won an Oscar for Costume Design). Warner Bros. was also accused of this for getting the Academy to nominate <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ExtremelyLoudAndIncrediblyClose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ExtremelyLoudAndIncrediblyClose">Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close</a></em> for Best Picture because of its negative reception; the organization had already stopped accepting bribes by then.
</li><li> The current lobbying is said to have started with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/harvey-weinstein-steven-spielberg-nastiest-oscar-campaign-ever-1187125">the most aggressive campaign possible<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as Harvey Weinstein went all the way to ensure the well-made, audience-pleasing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShakespeareInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShakespeareInLove">Shakespeare in Love</a></em> took Best Picture from the widely acclaimed highest-grossing movie of the year <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SavingPrivateRyan">Saving Private Ryan</a></em>, featuring a "press blitzkrieg" saturating the pre-ceremony months with events endorsing the film, going after individual Academy members with both a dedicated phone line and sending VHS screeners, and a downright smear campaign trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">Accentuate the Negative</a> about its opponent.
</li></ul></li><li> This supposedly could even go so far as getting you into Heaven; in the 14th through 16th centuries in Catholic Europe, you could buy "indulgences", a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card for a specific sin, you didn't have to worry about getting punished for it. Or so some people claimed (and many people believed): the Church's official line (then and now) was that indulgences are only for remission of temporal&mdash;i.e. earthly&mdash;punishment for some sin you had committed or would commit. It was more "donate some money and you can get out of having to go through that whole annoying business of confession and penance" than "give us money and you won't have to go to Purgatory." Then the Protestant Reformation came along&mdash;in part because a German bishop kinda-sorta counted on people misunderstanding the true meaning of the indulgence to get people to buy them and pay for his new cathedral and palace&mdash;and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedFOREVER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/RuinedFOREVER">ruined everything</a>.
</li><li> Any online video game that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayToWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayToWin">lets players buy in-game items or abilities with real-life money</a> falls squarely into the trope. Want to reach the end game but are too lazy or unskilled to do so? Just spend a few extra dollars and you're on your way to being as powerful as the next player who spent many months or even years trying to reach the same level of power! This is even worse in player VS player games where a match can be determined by who spent more money to win. A few games even take this further where players can break a rule or two and get away with it as long as they don't do it openly, simply because they paid a lot (although this is mostly averted).
</li><li> A term that's gaining in popularity is "Affluenza", where someone's wealth is claimed to lead to moral decay because of their firm belief in this trope. This proved controversial in 2013 when it was used as a legal defense <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Couch">in a drunk driving incident<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that killed 4 pedestrians and injured two others. Even worse is that it was (largely) successful, netting the 17-year-old boy at the wheel a comparatively light 10 years' probation, community service, and rehab - at a $500,000 a year facility with a plethora of possible activities. This has led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the teen's rich parents might have bribed the judge in order to make such a ludicrous defense work.
<ul><li> And even more recent news exacerbated this - while the facility is $715 <em>per day</em>, his parents were ordered to pay only $1,150 a <em>month</em> - roughly 5% of the actual cost, leaving the rest (presumably) to the taxpayers.
<ul><li> This trope was finally averted when Couch missed a meeting with his parole officer, then <em>fled to Mexico</em> with his mother. This drew him a sentence of two years in prison.
</li><li> In January 2020, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/02/us/ethan-couch-affluenza-accused-of-probation-violation/index.html">Couch was arrested again<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for violating parole when he tested positive for THC, though he was later released due to an inability to prove it was from marijuana rather than CBD oil.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One political cartoon from the <a class="urllink" href="http://pixgood.com/1920s-political-cartoons-prohibition.html">Prohibition era<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> featured a line of people with some connection to law enforcement (from the officer on the beat to the magistrate and the legislator who passed the law), each with an open hand behind his back waiting for his bribe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight">Not Always Right</a></em> has many good examples of this trope, like this guy <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/becoming-familiar-with-fiber/2073">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Gaines let his hair grow long, his beard grow scraggly, wore the same style of clunky horn-rim glasses for the rest of his life, and steadfastly refused to wear a suit-coat or tie.

</li><li> More than one person who has won a major lottery jackpot has simply quit their job immediately, even if they were supposed to give notice.
</li><li> Owners of expensive sports cars tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">speed, drag race and ignore traffic laws</a>. Though if you search on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2l6nk7pMQ0">"supercar fails"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, many of these drivers find out the hard way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">no amount of money can buy them exemptions from the laws of physics</a>. They have closed race tracks for a reason.
</li><li> Inverted in some parts of the world: Screw The Rules, I <em>Don't</em> Have Money!. For example, where motorcycles are more common than cars and mark them as middle-lower income class, you will tend to find them more blatantly disregarding the traffic rules. Going against the normal direction in a one-way street is just the tip of the iceberg, and their excuse is often that motorcycles are easier to handle than a car and they can afford to do such stunts, or that they're less privileged and thus should be exempt from certain rules.
</li><li> In a rare non-villainous example, the multi-billionaire industrialist and aviator Howard Hughes was a big fan of the "throwing money on a problem until it goes away" method of problem-solving as it was simpler and faster than going through the proper channels. As his OCD worsened in his later years, he would do things like buying an entire casino to make them remove a neon-lit sign, as it was shining through his bedroom window and disturbing his sleep.
<ul><li> One particularly funny example is when he stayed for ten days at the Desert Inn hotel in Las Vegas. When the hotel staff tried convincing Hughes to check out and leave, he bought out the entire hotel from under them and declared he would leave when he damn well felt like it.
</li></ul></li><li> Joseph Joanovici, a Romanian Jew, was able to become an honorary Aryan during the Nazi occupation of France thanks to being a billionaire who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">sold iron to Nazi Germany</a>. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides">financed the resistance on top of getting a Gestapo card</a> thanks to his wealth which avoided him harsher sentence when his Nazi affiliation and war profiteering came to light (he got five years of prison reduced to 3 and is one of the few Jewish people banned from Israel). One anecdote about him is that when the Carlingue's leader brought up he was a Jew he asked how much would it cost to not be one.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">far from the first case of such a thing happening</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/YouTube">YouTube</a>, Logan Paul's controversial video opened a <em>lot</em> of peoples' eyes to the fact that, despite being in direct violation of Youtube's ToS, Youtube will happily turn a blind eye to blatant violations, as long as your videos bring in a lot of viewers and thus ad revenue.
<ul><li> In fact, this has been all but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/09/youtubes-arbitrary-standards-stars-keep-making-money-even-after-breaking-rules/">confirmed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by former moderation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/YouTube">YouTube</a>. Logan Paul was shown tazing a rat and only got away with a 90-day suspension. People with fewer subscribers have reported getting demonetized or even banned <em>indefinitely</em> for <em>mentioning</em> things like true crime.
</li></ul></li><li> Twitter often comes under fire for its slipshod moderation and its hesitation to suspend or ban people who break the rules. This rings all the more true for celebrities and politicians, who regularly flout the site's rules but rarely suffer any consequences for it. Twitter officials say this method is to protect and encourage free speech, but critics argue its more likely that they simply prefer the high levels of traffic created by high profile controversies started on the site and the large amounts of ad revenue they receive from it.
</li><li> Twitch is also criticised for the same reason - Twitch is just fine when a big streamer does things that would earn a smaller streamer a ban due to the amount of advertisement revenue. This overlaps strongly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">Screw the Rules, I Have Connections!</a>.
</li><li> While there is a specific trope for Video games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayToWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayToWin">allowing you to get better equipment or more resources for paying</a>, there is a much different way: Video game moderation. Video game moderators are already <em>very</em> reluctant to actually punish troublemakers especially since they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming">tell people to just block them rather than do anything bad</a>. But when the game is supported by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.alistdaily.com/strategy/mobile-gaming-whales-fitting-new-descriptors/">Whales<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, certain players are objectively <em>worth more</em> to the company than others due to them investing so much money. Essentially, being a Whale is also a good way to avoid receiving any kind of significant recompense for your behaviour, allowing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">greater fuckery</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits">Extra Credits</a></em> even expressed concerns that this could happen.
<ul><li> Streamers and YouTubers have also been reported flouting the rules and getting away with it. People have released videos and streams demonstrating how easy it is to break the rules in games, and the worst they have received is a temporary ban or even a chat ban. Other users who have done minor things have even received permanent bans, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">since most of these games are free to start</a>, come back with a new name and a new face within the day.
</li></ul></li><li> In the mid-1990s, McDonald's lost a lawsuit against a South African businessman opening up hundreds of fake franchises of the chain because the real chain was not operating in South Africa during Apartheid, they had forfeited their own trademarks in South Africa and the businessman in question had effectively managed to acquire them post-abandonment. McDonald's, instead of filing another lawsuit or appealing to the court, chose to buy the businessman's fake operation and turn it into a real McDonald's franchise.
