</div></div><p><em>If the fans conclude that the writing team will never resolve its plots, then they will probably stop following the work.</em>
</p><p>It's said that no one ever went broke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">underestimating the taste of the viewing public</a>, but sometimes a show comes along that promises stories so complex and subtle that they'll make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> look like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FrogAndToad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FrogAndToad">Frog and Toad Are Friends</a>". If it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProducerThinksOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProducerThinksOfEverything">done right</a>, then this is catnip to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroperDemographics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroperDemographics">a certain sector of the viewing public</a>, who will often give such a show a surprisingly long time to set up its plot arcs before getting antsy for a resolution. The catch for the creator is that, the longer an arc runs and the more complicated it gets, the more awesome its payoff must be for it to feel satisfying to the fans. It's much easier for a writer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">keep kicking the can</a> &mdash; piling mysteries on top of mysteries &mdash; rather than finish storylines. This trope was invoked in the British TV serial <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSingingDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSingingDetective">The Singing Detective</a></em>, in which mystery novelist Philip Marlowe asserts that fiction, like life, should be "all clues and no solutions."

Plots resting on a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Driving Question</a> (Where is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">the Sunflower Samurai?</a> Who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">Mrs. Mosby?</a>) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">allowed some leeway</a>; otherwise, the production team would be out of work and the story would end. The Chris Carter Effect happens when a work is wholly focused on twists or not building up to a satisfactory resolution, but on the other hand, the plotting sometimes becomes so bloated that there can no longer <em>be</em> a satisfactory resolution (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion">Ending Aversion</a>). Another contributing effect could be the unsatisfactory resolution of long-running side-plots. At this point, even the most ardent fans will start to feel jerked around, or at the very least channel flip to something else.
</p><p>Sometimes, the lack of a resolution is not the writers' fault: the network might have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">pulled the plug early</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">compromised the original vision</a> by having it focus on more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">merchandisable elements</a> or to keep adding to or expanding on the author's intended story.

Specifically, the combination of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime">Webcomic Time</a> can have a similar effect on the audience, even when a finale is in the works, if the piece stretches out long enough that the fans lose track of the original premise of the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a> is this trope on a smaller scale, in which just a single story arc goes on for too long without any resolution rather than the entire series. Can be connected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">Franchise Original Sin</a> in that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> is successful at first before devolving over time into less-successful territory.
</p><p>If fans doubt that such a show will even <em>survive</em> to finish its story and don't bother tuning in, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect">The Firefly Effect</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">Writing by the Seat of Your Pants</a>, which does not focus on how the audience reacts to it.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> anime seems to have no real set goals for the characters in mind despite having heavy references to Pokemon mastery and the like. None of the characters have truly achieved any of their goals as of yet. Thus, many fans have given up on ever seeing any of the characters' stories really wrapped up at any point in the foreseeable future... of course, seeing as the target demographic is eight to twelve years old, it also doesn't seem to matter all that much, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographic">some fans give up on it</a> (and are replaced by younger fans) before this trope becomes much of an issue.
<ul><li> Even region-long plot threads have been known to go either unaddressed or at least awkwardly addressed, especially after Sinnoh started. Team Plasma just seemingly vanished off the face of the earth, making fans wonder if planned episodes for them were cancelled. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1bi0g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1bi0g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1bi0g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually, they eventually did show up right after the Unova League for an arc which was resolved, but the two episodes they were meant to be introduced in were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> away.</span> Paul has been abusive to his Pokemon for all of Sinnoh, but his "comeuppance" is simply losing to Ash and walking away while people say rather nice things about him, given what they know about the guy. And both the Contest Champion and the Pokemon League champion are characters only introduced for those events, leaving all the rivals hanging as well as the protagonists. Sinnoh and Kalos are the only major exceptions; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the contest champion in Sinnoh is Zoey, who had been a significant rival and supporting cast member since the region began. Likewise, the Pokemon League Champion in Kalos is Alain, who was a major character in the Mega Evolution mini-series</span>.
</li><li> This has almost become an enforced trope in regards to Ash and his Pokemon. After Hoenn he almost never even mentions any Pokemon from prior regions besides Pikachu, meaning if any of those Pokemon or even most trainers from those regions had outstanding plots, they will never be resolved. Also, Ash will never win any Pokemon League, thus making an endgame for the series genuinely impossible. His best achievements in that area were the Battle Frontier which was, again, in the Hoenn series, and the Orange Islands, which was filler. The only way this can come to an end is if someone among the upper echelons who has control of the show gets everyone to abandon the status quo (<em>The First Movie</em> was originally planned to be the finale for Ash and company, if that means anything).
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The rule that Ash can never win a tournament was finally broken when he won not only the Alola League but the exhibition match with Professor Kukui afterward.</span>
</li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> that Ash obtains that compels him to travel to a particular region, if it's not in a movie, will become a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> as Ash and his companions get caught up in something else, and they'll eventually leave it with someone never to be seen again (such as the GS Ball) or it's completely wiped from existence or anyone's memory (Misty's bicycle). With the GS Ball, however, there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> on it: The GS Ball originally was supposed to contain Celebi, but that plotline was reappropriated into one of the movies, so the producer decided to quietly remove the GS Ball from the story in hopes everyone would forget about it. And as for Misty's bike, right before Misty leaves the company of Ash and Brock in Johto, we <em>finally</em> get closure regarding it when the Nurse Joy from the Pokemon Center Ash went to in the second episode of the Kanto saga (where Misty cornered him and chewed him out for Pikachu frying her bike and it was actually pivotal to the episode as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">reveals she restored it to mint condition in the time Misty has been gone</a> (because Misty abandoned it there in the Pokemon Center knowing it was no use to her anymore).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Subverted. Although the manga's creator, Akira Toriyama, has stated several times that he was just making stuff up as he wrote each chapter, he actually managed quite brilliantly to solve most of them as time went on instead of leaving them hanging. Heck, even the fact that Goku had a tail was explained, and Oolong even suggested the theory that Goku was a space alien a long time before Toriyama decided to make it so, giving the story unintentional foreshadowing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> ran into this when it came to Guts and his party's goal to reach Elfheim, where the possibility of Casca's insanity being cured lay. With Miura's scheduling slipping, it was inevitably going to take a long time, but fans worried that others would lose interest. It took almost <em>eight years</em> for Guts to finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">get off the damn boat</a> and reach Elfheim. But then the subplot sped up and Casca was successfully cured. Only for Miura to leave her further reaction as a Cliffhanger and focusing on Griffith again, with his usual hiatus going on.
</li><li> There is, of course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">long-running</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, which hasn't progressed its "plot" by much in <em>16 real-life years</em>...
<ul><li> ... until the Bourbon arc goes out of its slow start and then the series features at least a bit of plot advancement in every single case. It is still debatable whether the plot is really advancing or not, but the reveals of the true identities of the newcomers, the gambit to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">make the Black Organization believe Sherry is finally dead for real</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bourbon getting directly interested in Conan for his crime-solving ability and connections to the FBI</span>, can certainly be called plot advancements.
</li><li> As of 2018 and the series returning from a long hiatus caused by Aoyama having health issues, it's rare for a story arc to <em>not</em> advance the plot. Maybe it's been realized that if the series ends because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>, it would be hard to keep selling the volumes?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: A big complaint within the fandom was that Tite Kubo seemed to have so many hanging plot threads that he didn't seem to be paying any attention to. The final arc began the process of tying up all dangling plot threads, character issues, and backstories, even covering events the fandom had been convinced Tite Kubo had forgotten all about and addressing issues that the fandom had completely missed the original significance of. Unfortunately, due to the declining health of the author and Shonen Jump insisting on a quick end, the manga was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a> and it is likely that the unanswered questions the author didn't get to will never be resolved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLostVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLostVillage">The Lost Village</a></em> lost fans due to the slow start and the fact that the mystery didn't really seem to go anywhere, things get better after episode 7, but due to that slow start, some fans still think that the ending was rushed.
</li><li> Episode 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HumanityHasDeclined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HumanityHasDeclined">Humanity Has Declined</a></em> was theoretically a satire/parody of modern manga business practices, but mostly ended up addressing this. When the characters find themselves needing to make a popular manga, the local mangaka explains that the way to make a bestselling manga is not to craft a consistent plot but to keep stringing viewers along with constant cliffhangers, since they won't realize the plot holes until the end. However, once the audience catches on, the popularity of their manga drops like a stone.
<div class="indent"> <em>The greatest entertainer is the greatest swindler!</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X1999</a></em> remains on hold since 2003 with 18 volumes out of a planned 21 with a few chapters which is supposed to be for the 19th volume. Nanase Ohkawa, the lead writer of CLAMP, mentioned that they're still looking for a magazine willing to publish the remaining chapters. However, a decade had already passed and CLAMP put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gate7">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LegalDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LegalDrug">more</a> works on hold to work on <em>Tsubasa World Chronicle</em> and <em>xxxHolic: Rei</em>. Fans of <em>X/1999</em> are not pleased with this and doubt that the manga will ever continue at this point. It doesn't help that several plot points have been left hanging for a decade such as Kamui's "true" wish and most importantly, who wins between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">Xxx Holic</a></em> started off very well developing the cast until it got too closely intertwined with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> which complicate things such as Watanuki's and Yuko's backstories. And then, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuko "dies" and Watanuki inherits the shop with a new purpose which is to wait for her</span>. It doesn't help that the manga ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">without a resolution</a>. Later, CLAMP continued the manga with <em>xxxHolic: Rei</em> which brought the return of Yuko as the shop owner with the possibility that Watanuki's stuck in a dream. However, readers find that the new manga brought nothing new to the story or that CLAMP is dragging the direction too long.

The novels were completed by his friend and like the anime, it only stops at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ester's coronation as Queen of Albion</span> while Abel and Ion traveled around the world to stop Cain. The manga is said to end at that part as well. So even if one would continue the series with the notes left by Yoshida, the resolution between Abel and the humans vs. Cain and the Rosenkreuz Orden remained unsolved because the last notes stopped at the final battle between the two brothers without the result.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter &times; Hunter</a></em> suffers from extreme Schedule Slip, and hasn't come close to resolving many plots as a result, such as the Phantom Troupe and the Dark Continent arc. The series began to inch forward in stunted segments due to constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hiatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hiatus">Hiatus</a>, making little gains until 2016 finally saw the ball rolling with several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">bang-up chapters</a> before another long drought. In 2017, despite another hiatus, the story finally gets down to business, because this is the first time in a <em>long</em> time that Yoshihiro Togashi has taken a hiatus and promised to <strong>come back</strong> at a set return date and has found a nervous rhythm that is giving the story momentum.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DiabolikLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DiabolikLovers">Diabolik Lovers</a></em> went two seasons with no resolved sexual tension and no new progressions in the plot, unless one counts the plethora of new, entirely unforeshadowed characters that show up in the second finale and have absolutely no relation to the preexisting characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Who will the new Adam be?</a> You can be sure the viewers don't know.

That was in 2009. She recovered the following year, but seven years later, she's yet to pick up the story and resolve details such as, who is really the father of Hachi's daughter, whether she will stay with Takumi or break up with him<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2p3dd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2p3dd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2p3dd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">about this, the only thing that is known is that, while not divorced (yet), Hachi and Takumi are estranged</span>, whether someone will find Nana O. in Europe or she will get in touch with her friends first, and so on.

Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the burning questions are answered slowly across six movies. The first one being released in 2015 and its finale being released around 2018. Not only that, but the overall answer, especially early on, is either "we don't know" or never brought up. Perhaps the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> plot point of this is the fate of the 02 kids, as no one tends to question what happened to them, even when one of them shows up, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only for it to be revealed to be a disguise for their old mentor turned evil</span>.

<ul><li> Many of the plot elements related to the Spider-Totem introduced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> during his run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> from 2001 to 2007 gave readers a lot of doubletalk and mystical mumbo-jumbo, but very little in the way of concrete resolution, like exactly why Peter had to "evolve", why one cosmic entity wanted to bring him back from the dead while another thought he should stay deceased, the mysterious entities that resurrected Mysterio and Miss Arrow and what they wanted with Peter, etc. None of this was ever really explained.
<ul><li> A degree of resolution was achieved in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a> storyline, which explained the origins of the Inheritors and had Spider-Man and his allies defeat them.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a>. Originally, the story was supposed to wrap up after a few months, after an already complicated narrative. However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">efforts</a> of Marvel executives, the story was extended for another year, with plot twists being reversed constantly, and supposedly dead characters appearing, reappearing and then dying anticlimactically. The story finally limped to its conclusion with another plot twist that had almost nothing to do with most of the events that preceded it (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> was back</span>). It should be noted that, when the saga started, it was Marvel's highest-selling group of books. The act of stretching it to the limit for so long caused sales to slump, and fans turned away in droves.
</li><li> Most of the plots in the book during "Spider-Man's" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay">Brand New Day</a></em> storyline essentially went nowhere. Mysteries such as who was Jackpot, what Mr. Negative was going to do with Peter's blood, what happened to erase Peter's memories, why Harry was alive, and more were given an anti-climactic resolution, dragged out for several years, or worse, both. The explanation for Harry Osborn's return was that the goblin serum revived him, which made no sense since it was the thing that killed him in the first place. Jackpot was a character that the readers never met before and was killed off during the same story. Mysteries such as the secret to how Peter's identity was made a secret again were resolved in a manner that most of the audience figured out already, leading many to question why it was kept a secret for three years. After a while, it became clear that the writers had no real major arc planned for the character and his mythos, and were just making it up as they went along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersInParadise">Strangers in Paradise</a></em> featured a series of flash-forwards that never actually resolved or were explained. Writer Terry Moore went so far as to include not one but TWO fake-out reboots (one in which the comic's story turned out to be a book a new character was writing and another in which it turned out to all be a dream) which were then immediately discarded the very next issue. Eventually the last third of the series sort-of righted itself and all of the immediate conflicts were tied up by the end, but much of the first half of the run remains unexplained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> had a problem with this during the Penders/Bollers era. Everyone and their mother had some super-extraordinary destiny that they must fulfill (Knuckles and the mysterious dream his dad Locke had, Tails and the Great Harmony, Sally and whatever the Source wanted with her, etc.), but everyone seemed to forget that this was <em>Sonic's</em> comic and whenever he showed up, he was incredibly inefficient at being a hero - half of the time, he was <em>grounded</em> for one reason or another. It got to the point where the two head writers were at each other's throats and were forced off the title, Ian Flynn being forced to take over.
</li><li> The entirety of Scott Lobdell's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> had this problem. He'd introduce plot threads, most of which would go nowhere. Those that actually went somewhere led into <em>more</em> questions, which led into <em>more</em> questions. The linchpin of his entire run was the villain Harvest, a guy from the future who knew how to plan ahead for everything, and was doing what was best for humanity and was this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> figure and... turned out to be a generic villain whose plans made no sense. Skitter was called away in the middle of a crossover... and returns over a year later without that plot thread amounting to anything. Basically everything that wasn't a self-contained arc was being made up as it went along.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a></em> series is a rare example of a film franchise running into this, which started once it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">taken out of the hands of its creators</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIV">the fourth film</a> onward. As new twists were thrown into the overarching story, it became less about a madman who forces people into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOrLimbDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOrLimbDecision">Life or Limb Decisions</a> in order to prove a moral point and more about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">increasingly convoluted</a> machinations of the people fighting over that man's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy">Villainous Legacy</a>. Eventually, many fans had given up on following the plot and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">were just there for the over-the-top gore effects</a>. Once diminishing box-office returns started setting in with the later films, the writers finally started to make an effort in tying off the many loose threads, but the ultimate resolution proved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">fairly divisive</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a> suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> pushing towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> a little faster than anticipated, resulting in cramming in subplots and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">sequel hooks</a> but end up abandoning these later on in response to audience reaction. Most notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a>, who directed the first two movies in the franchise, added numerous scenes in his second movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> (the Knightmare sequence, the Darkseid nods, Flash's warnings) that would pay off in his later films. However, these plot threads became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">aborted arcs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">Justice League</a></em> as Snyder left mid-production over a family tragedy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">studio interference</a>. Individuals involved with other film series like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot">Gal Gadot</a> have implied some elements of the earlier films would be altered or ignored going forward (like the idea Diana turned away from humanity for a full 100 years), and the franchise found success by downplaying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> and emphasizing crowd pleasing standalone movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em>.
</li><li> The sequel trilogy for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> made under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> gradually made it clear there was not a solid plan regarding how the movies were supposed to progress forward. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a> is credited with developing the new characters and new situation of the setting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, and deliberately left the ending open for other writers and directors to answer lingering questions. The excitement of new Star Wars movies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">made it well received at the time, explicitly with fans hoping that further movies would be less derivative going forward</a>. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> directed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RianJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RianJohnson">Rian Johnson</a> came out, it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">Contested Sequel</a> because apparent plot threads were either dropped or given blunt, uninteresting answers (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rey has no special lineage, Luke just gave up and is waiting to die in exile, Snoke had no special training in store for Kylo and is killed before the third act</span>). Afterwards, Abrams admitted they had no clear answer to those things when writing the first film, and Abrams returned to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em> that seemed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> about half the things from <em>The Last Jedi</em> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> while also including other unforeshadowed reveals (the Emperor is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>). This only reinforced the perception that despite having three guaranteed films they didn't do any long-term planning.
<ul><li> Behind-the-scenes issues exaggerated some of the problems. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinTrevorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinTrevorrow">Colin Trevorrow</a> was initially tapped to direct the third film, but for whatever reason he was let go just before <em>The Last Jedi</em> was released and Abrams was brought on to wrap things up. A few weeks after the release of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">a leaked script for Trevorrow's movie</a> along with concept art, all confirmed to be true, emerged that would have followed through on the story points rather than pull everything back. An underlying issue with the Sequels ended up being that they were given release dates two years apart and all three films were in some stage of production at the same time. This meant that rather than doing one movie at a time and gauging the direction to go after one was finished, you had people working on the direct sequel of a movie that hadn't even been made yet, which only resulted in scrambled attempts to make a movie that follows through on what audiences actually liked.

Despite this, he stated that he would conclude the series with book 12 "whether it's 15,000 pages, Tor has to invent a new binding system, or it comes with its own library cart," since it was very unlikely that he could write a coherent thirteenth book. This turned out to be true, but for other reasons than he expected: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrandonSanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a>, the writer tapped to finish the series in Jordan's stead, eventually decided that resolving every arc properly would take no less than <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article/56/Splitting-AMOL">three<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> books.

Nobody wanted to experiment with binding, and retailers don't like boxed sets. Besides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">three separate books are more profitable than one</a>.</span>
<ul><li> As the series took 25 years to finish, many fans dropped off after reading the most recent book and waiting years for the next to come out. Due to said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a>, new books would be unintelligible after years away without rereading most of the series, and so this effect took hold.
</li></ul></li><li> Daniel "Lemony Snicket" Handler deliberately exploited this.

Handler claims this was his intent from book one. Thus the final book "The End" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">is anything but</a>, though it does answer the series' most important question: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Beatrice was the Baudelaires' mother.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Remnants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Remnants">Remnants</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KAApplegate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KAApplegate">K. A. Applegate</a>. It spends the first ten or so books setting up a bunch of mysteries (why do some of the humans have superpowers now? What is the Ancient Enemy, and how is it connected to Billy and/or the Troika? What happened to the missing five humans?), but promptly switches to basically a new plot for the last few books, with <em>none</em> of the questions answered. Granted, the plotline at the end was pretty good and <em>somewhat</em> more coherent until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a>... but it's like the first ten books were wasted with a destination of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">nowhere.</a></em>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em> intentionally invokes this trope by starting many more story arcs than it intends to finish.

Martin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">expanding to at least seven books</a> and suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a> has convinced some fans that Martin has no idea where he's going with the series.
<ul><li> Part of this comes from the fourth and fifth being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">Contested Sequels</a> for their expanded scope, slower pace, and greater emphasis on character development and world-building than action and plot, though this is somewhat intentional both as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> and because they were designed to fill in an abandoned five-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. The other main reason is that the whole series is a vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet">Deconstructor Fleet</a>, which makes for a very exciting read but also means that no fan has <em>ever</em> had more than a vague idea what the final book will be like or what the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> even <em>is</em>, making it easier to for fans to get accusatory because they're bloody sick of waiting.
</li><li> Martin himself is aware of this concern and has consistently made clear that he <em>does</em> know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> of the story's events and ending, it's just getting there in a coherent and compelling fashion that's proving more complicated than he ever imagined and he has no plans to continue expanding, even half-jokingly declaring he needs to start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">killing off</a> more characters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper">simplify things</a> in <em>The Winds of Winter</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a></em> suffers heavily from this, though it doesn't really become apparent until <em>Saving The World and Other Extreme Sports</em>. As what was intended as the final book of a trilogy, you'd expect it to finally start resolving plot arcs, but instead it just keeps throwing in wackier and wackier twists while deliberately avoiding answering any questions.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, Chris Carter, creator of the show, who is infamous for this:
<ul><li> For the first half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the 1990s</a>, the fans were convinced that Carter had plotted an elaborate and minutely thought-out web of deceit and lies for his FBI agents to unravel. Forests of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> sprouted around every new tantalizing hint revealed. No reference was too obscure for devoted X-Philes, who cheerfully threw themselves into history, folklore, myth, science, or any other branch of human knowledge that seemed like it might shed some light on the story. By mid-decade, though, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> story had churned along for years without really answering any of the questions raised. In fact, even when the show would answer something it would raise at least two new questions in the same turn, and even the old answers were very prone to getting subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcons</a>. Eventually, the overarching story had effectively mutated into a dense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a>, and fans began to suspect that there <em>was</em> no intricately plotted story &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">Carter had just been making it all up as he went along</a>. (Carter himself eventually confirmed this suspicion.) Fans were irritated by the resolutions to side plots that were long-running, such as the fate of Mulder's sister &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out she was spirited away by the fairies</span>! This eventually went on into the finale which made promises of resolving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> which not only fails to do so but also in the last ten minutes presents a teaser for an alien invasion set to occur in 2012 (which to this day looks like it may never be resolved at all).
</li><li> When the series was given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">unexpected revival</a> in 2016, it didn't take this trope long to hit it again. Pretty much true to form, the first episode begins with a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> that makes a hash of a lot of the previous mythology, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> aliens not having much interaction with humanity at all, and most of their supposed crimes being the work of humans using stolen alien technology &mdash; despite the numerous aliens that had been on the show before</span>. Most of the season was filler, and the season finale ends on <em>yet another</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a>, despite another season not being greenlit at that point and the principal actors not signed on for more. Fans who were hoping to finally get some closure after years of waiting were left sorely disappointed; at best, they might finally get a resolution in another few years, at worst, the show gets cancelled again and they're right back to where they started.
</li><li> Two years later, the revival would get a second season, only for it to start with the extremely controversial twist that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scully was essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">raped by the Cigarette-Smoking Man</a> to produce William</span>, and end with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Cigarette-Smoking Man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">yet again</a> being killed for presumably the last time, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">yet again</a> the X-Files are shut down as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a></span>. Once again, fans were less than satisfied, though general reception for the season was more positive than the first.
</li></ul></li><li> Also by Chris Carter, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Millennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Millennium">Millennium</a></em> is a good example of this. The show got increasingly bizarre and difficult to follow as it went on, and the end of the third (and final) season provided no closure at all. Each season had a different showrunner(s), each with a <em>very</em> different idea of what the show should be (Are Frank Black's flashes simply a visualization of his deductive skills or psychic visions? What is the Millennium group's agenda?) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">no one from above willing to set boundaries</a>. After the cancellation, the whole thing was put into the laps of <em>The X-Files</em> team. This resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAbsorbedFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAbsorbedFinale">Fully Absorbed Finale</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Millennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Millennium">Millennium</a></em> within <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> that also failed to resolve anything.
</li><li> This trope is a suspected contributor to the failure of <em>X-Files</em> spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoneGunmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoneGunmen">The Lone Gunmen</a></em>.
</li><li> Carter's attempted Amazon series <em>The After</em> was ultimately called off because of this trope. Amazon wanted a "show bible" before the first season was made, Carter preferred to make it up as he went along. It was an especially tough sell since Carter wanted the show to last for 99 episodes at a whopping $40 million per 9 episode season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>. At any given time, exactly half of its fanbase believed that the show's creators were making the next <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> and had no idea what endgame they desired, while the other half argued that the threads were finally coming together, and a satisfactory revelation was all but guaranteed. In the end, it's a matter of opinion on how it all turned out. The most diplomatic way to phrase it would be to say that there were two groups of fans: those who thought it was about the characters, and those who thought it was about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">the plot and mythology</a>. The former seem to have generally been pleased by the ending, while the latter were generally very upset and firm believers that this trope was in effect. Generally, science fiction can have an open ending as long as the fates of the most interesting characters are resolved. Unfortunately, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, a large chunk thought the island was the most interesting character.
</li><li> In general, the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a> often have this problem. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> put it best: "A creative visionary and genius... for approximately two seasons, after which point he cracks, panics and starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">rambling on about magic</a> instead of writing a coherent plotline." To a certain degree, even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Felicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Felicity">Felicity</a></em> fell prey to this, as did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em>.
</li><li> Luckily, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> largely averted this trope with the "Parallel Universe"-arc, that was the series' main plot thread since the end of season 1, being given a very emotional bittersweet ending towards the end of Season 4, which also answered the mystery of the Observers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they're the human race from the future</span>. Season 5 introduced a new storyline <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the form of the Observer occupation of present-day Earth</span> which moved at a pretty fast pace, answering questions as it drops more (but less than it answered) and ultimately ended in a conclusive manner while throwing in one last mindscrew for fans to twist their brains over.
<ul><li> Walter Bishop did quote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkesThirdLaw">Clarke's Third Law</a> word for word in response to a particularly bizarre case. There <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum">aren't really any limits</a> set for <em>Fringe</em> to break, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that they did have an ending and a way to get there, plotted over several seasons. However, said ending could be adjusted and deployed on short notice in case they didn't get as many seasons as they planned for; this is obvious given the sheer pacing of Season 5's storyline.
</li></ul></li><li> Demonstrated failure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>. But really, what did they expect from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a>? Writer and committed Lynch fan David Foster Wallace opined in an essay that Season 2 was some of the best television he'd ever watched, in that it was some of the <em>worst</em> television he'd ever watched. If you watch it all in a row, it's pretty clear that it's one long nervous breakdown on the part of Lynch as he never intended the mystery of Laura Palmer's murder to be solved, with the series intended to be more of an exploration of the characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> forced him to solve the mystery mid-Season 2, which left him with literally no idea where to go from there, and hence he opted to work on other projects.
<ul><li> As a result, Lynch was hardly involved with the rest of Season 2 &#151; he didn't write or direct any of the next 14 episodes and returned only to direct the finale. There's a consensus among <em>Twin Peaks</em> fans that the episodes directed by Lynch are the best of the series.
</li><li> Basically, it seems to be an inversion of this trope: a show's downfall caused by the resolution of a plot thread that was never intended to be solved. <em>Twin Peaks</em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> driven by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Driving Question</a> that was mistaken by ABC executives to be this, and the forced closing of plotlines led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Seasonal Rot</a> and cancellation.
</li><li> The series did eventually get a concluding season <em>25 years</em> later with a set number of episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Pretty Little Liars</a></em> used this to sustain itself. Every time someone looked like they might be the stalker of the girls - known only as A - they inevitably turned out not to be and old characters were brought back to deepen the web. By the fifth season, fans were growing tired that A was still running rings around the main characters, and progression was made in the sixth season.
</li><li> Perhaps the ultimate example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em>, which posed lots of ongoing questions &#151; Who runs the Village? Why did Number Six resign? Who is Number One? &#151; but ended with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">utterly incomprehensible</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">that answered none of them</a>.
<ul><li> The series did a sequel via the "Shattered Visage" graphic novel that did at least attempt to bring closure to Number Six. It's apparently more or less official, as the famously cranky Patrick McGoohan "didn't hate" the plot.
</li></ul></li><li> Strictly speaking, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePretender">The Pretender</a></em> never resolved any of its over-arching plots. The show creators joked that a detailed master plan for the narrative was hidden "inside the pickle jar" and buried in their backyard, but in actuality the writing sessions were becoming increasingly devoted to impromptu games of poker among the staff. This may explain why, though the exact circumstances and reason for series protagonist Jarod's abduction as a child remained unclear, nearly every character in the show was revealed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIMightBeYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIMightBeYourFather">uncertain parentage</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSibling">a long-lost relative</a>. Following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">unintentional finale</a>, two successive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made For TV Movies</a>, both of which ended with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliff Hangers</a>, introduced more questions than answers.
</li><li> This was pretty much what got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em> canceled. The long-awaited elaboration of the fabled 'Future People' was half-answered very late in the show, but then about twice as many new questions cropped up. The cancellation then abruptly cut off any hope of the rest of it being resolved. Damn shame, really.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> was hailed as great, tightly-plotted, and well-written storytelling, with a clear goal in mind. Its second and third seasons, though, were prime examples of the Chris Carter Effect in action &#151; the writing team flailing around, directionless, at war with its own continuity &#151; and it only started to re-establish its arc as of Volume 4. Unfortunately, the writers had envisioned each "volume" to be about a different set of heroes with a different set of problems to solve, but fans just wanted more cheerleader beheadings.
<ul><li> The fans actually wanted a resolution, but it's said that the writers got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">too focused on giving in to the demands of whatever the message board consensus was this week</a> and lost track of, y'know, the plot. And it got them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cancelled">Cancelled</a>.
</li><li> In their defense in regards to season two, they had planned a long, elaborate 2-volume (i.e. season-long) arc in which all the seemingly-loose plot threads would have come together. In the original ending of volume two, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Peter wouldn't have caught the virus vial, and it would have been let loose in Odessa, causing the pandemic seen in Out of Time. Volume Three would have been about the pandemic. Claire's blood's healing properties were going to be used to heal virus victims, and resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a> Maya would have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissedTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissedTheCall">used her powers to absorb the virus and sacrifice herself to save the world</a></span>. Unfortunately, the writer's strike cut the season in half, and instead of waiting an undetermined amount of time to resolve plots new viewers wouldn't be up to date on, they chose to wrap up the season and abandon all planned story arcs. This explains why the plot seems muddled and full of red herrings; they quite literally aborted entire character arcs, causing most of the established developments in season 2 to become redundant.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> based itself on there being some sort of big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> that was behind Michael getting fired from the CIA. Each season does manage to shake up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>, it goes from everything being a complete mystery to him having a love/hate relationship with the organization that burned and eventually gathering evidence to bring to the CIA that they actually exist and work with them to start dismantling it. The issue fans have with the status quo is built on four parts:
<ul><li> The show's deliberately set and filmed in Miami (trying to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">California Doubling</a>) and thus Michael can't do too much globetrotting,
</li><li> Each episode is consistently split in half between an episodic story and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> story that makes for a rather detached A and B story,
</li><li> The episodic story often becomes more about the accent Michael has to use,
</li><li> ... And even the myth arc story is organized as Michael following a trail of bread crumbs that leads him to the big twist of the season.
</li><li> Still, Seasons 5-6 managed to really change up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">We Help the Helpless</a> monotone of the episodic story and managed to merge both the myth arc and episodic plots as working together.
</li></ul></li><li> The rebooted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> was accused of this on several occasions &#151; the effect can be traced back as far as Season 3 when the decision to largely abandon the show's carefully crafted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> in favor of a series of standalone episodes almost resulted in its cancellation (and eventual pushback from the producers to get the plot back on track). Still, the showrunners were open about the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">they were mostly making things up as they went along</a>. A series of open questions and mysteries were raised over the length of the show, and ended with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaving</a> and the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">God was responsible for many of the mysteries, and they may have been being literal in this</a></span>. As a result of the series bible's publication after the show finished airing, fans now know that none of the plot points introduced in Season 3, such as the Final Five and Starbuck's death/resurrection, were things the producers were aware of at all during the first two seasons &#151; they'd exhausted their stockpile of potential plotlines.
<ul><li> The "Final Five Cylons" debacle, which dominated the show since Season 3 began. Realizing that the gradual reveal of the promised "Twelve Cylon models" was boring, the writers broke their own established rules by making major recurring characters Cylons who logically couldn't be. One of them was married and had fathered a child; the cardinal rule about Cylons until then was that they're sterile. They handwaved it off by ham-fistedly retconning that his wife had an affair (after they dropped a bridge on her). To make it worse, they had already revealed that one of the Cylons was "Model Number Eight", and 8 + 5 = 13, not 12. They had to invent a backstory that there used to be a Number Seven model, but he got killed. The <em>BSG</em> writers didn't just apply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> to their work in the end; they fell back onto "divine intervention" to explain plot twists which, if you analyzed them objectively, didn't add up.
<ul><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica1978">the original series</a> was sometimes viewed negatively by fans of the new show, most of the best-loved plot elements were reimagined versions of original series episodes and plotlines. The show started meandering and falling apart precisely when the writers ran out of material and had to begin coming up with a metaplot of their own. Earlier ideas included "find Kobol, lost homeworld of humanity" or "what if another Battlestar survived?" (Pegasus), but by Season 3 they had run out of ideas.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Death of Starbuck" ruse: in the first two seasons, the writers often boasted that they respected the intelligence of their audience and didn't walk them through plot points. At the end of Season 3, with ratings dropping and the writers running out of ideas, they pretended to kill off Starbuck. Even in real life, the writers and cast were ordered to act like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateeSackhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateeSackhoff">Katee Sackhoff</a> left the show (Sackhoff was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and they did not know how long she will be gone for). The episode she was killed in bizarrely and obviously set up new plot points for her. She wasn't randomly shot or captured; she randomly flew into a storm due to a newly revealed religious plotline. It was confusing even then. Starbuck's "dramatic surprise return" was therefore predictable; writers who once said that they respected the audience's intelligence were now stooping to comic book deaths, though they insisted that this was a stroke of genius. All of this was supposedly related to Starbuck's "destiny", but they never fully explained (even in the finale) why Starbuck had to die and literally be resurrected by the Gods to lead the Fleet to Earth.
</li><li> Made worse by the fact that the intro crawl text assures viewers that the Cylons "have a plan" which explains their seemingly bizarre and illogical actions. Ron Moore openly admitted after the finale, word for word, that David Eick had called him up on the phone and said "it will be a great way to hook viewers in Season 1 if we put 'the Cylons have a Plan' into the opening credits." Ron was hesitant at first, and actually said back into the phone "but there is no frakking Cylon Plan!" They had never sketched out the motivations, goals, or even full backstory and social structure of the Cylons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>... there <em>never was</em> a "Cylon Plan", and they were lying the entire time. Eventually, the whole thing is hand-waved when a character says "plans change". After the show was canned, a TV movie called "The Plan" finally revealed the plan. It was a desperate attempt to <em>retcon</em> an explanation, which gave the simple answer "the Cylon Plan was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAllHumans">Kill All Humans</a> but it didn't work".
</li><li> There was also "the secret of the opera house", something that was being hinted at being something of great significance since season 1. In the finale, it takes up about 5 minutes to resolve, has little to do with any opera house at all, and is utterly pointless. It involves a 2-minute kidnapping of a character who was just rescued from a much longer and bigger kidnapping, and a cease-fire between the Cylons and Humans that lasts all of two minutes before shit hits the fan, and the kidnapper is simply shot. So the whole plot ends with a kidnappee being rescued and the Cylons shooting at Galactica. Which is exactly the situation before this all-important resolution of the opera house plotline. You could have fallen asleep during the resolution and you wouldn't have missed a thing.
<ul><li> The "opera house reveal" is actually one of the points that Ron D. Moore explicitly admitted he attempted to retcon an explanation for <em>as he was writing the series finale</em>. As he said, he knew they'd been hyping up these religious visions of the Kobol opera house since Season 1, so while writing the finale, decided the answer was that it was meant to represent the CIC during the final standoff (because it has tiered levels in it, vaguely like an opera house?) - it was simply an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>, but he was genuinely proud he thought of "an explanation", unashamed to admit that he made it up <em>retroactively</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> left the audience wondering who the shadowy individual directing new bad guy race the Suliban was. At the end of the series, they're still wondering, and apparently no one behind the scenes gave it much thought either. Instead of answering the questions the Temporal Cold War threw up or explaining characters' motivations, the show instead introduced more and more factions, their motives and goals just as nebulous as the ones that were already there. When a new showrunner took over for the beginning of Season 4, he introduced yet <em>another</em> new faction who were apparently the worst of the lot, blew them up and announced that the war was over and indeed had never happened (even though several events that were a direct result of the war clearly still had). Uh-huh?
<ul><li> Then again, a lot of people were just happy to see Temporal Cold War go away forever, regardless of whether or not it was resolved properly.
</li><li> Even after the show's cancellation, the identity of "Future Guy" remained muddled. Rick Berman claimed that they had never established his identity, while Manny Coto and Brannon Braga said he was probably a Romulan, only for Braga to later go back on that, claiming he had always intended him to be Archer, which still leaves unresolved <em>why</em> Archer would be doing all these horrible things. Meanwhile, the EU novels took his character in a different direction than any of those stated possibilities, making him Jamran Harnoth, the leader of a eugenics movement who was also using time travel to ensure his own existence (being of Suliban, Tadaran, <em>and</em> Romulan descent).
</li><li> As evidence that even the crew had no idea who Future Guy was, the term "Future Guy" - which the crew themselves used - was taken from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a>' reviews. Instead of even <em>having a name</em> for the main villain, they used a title taken from <em>a guy being sarcastic about the show</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carnivale">Carniv&agrave;le</a></em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a> created this in one scene. Early in the show, one of the characters has a vision of Ben and Sofie kissing as a nuclear warhead detonates in the background. Since the show took some pains to ground itself in the real timeline, this would put the vision in 1945. But the show was set in 19<strong>3</strong>5, and the pace of the plot meant that some fans immediately concluded that it'd never pay off. They were right. Knauf had planned a five-year time skip between Seasons 2 and 3, which would have brought the show to 1940, with further seasons to bridge the rest of the gap between then and the Trinity test, but then the show got canned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988">War of the Worlds (1988)</a></em> was based on the idea of humans discovering that the aliens from the original 1953 invasion had survived and were now resistant to radiation. Season 1, while obviously lacking in special effects, built up a number of story arcs that were intended to be long-term: the humans working to discover the identities of the aliens and out them to the world, allies which made guest appearances (and then promised to come back in the future), an alien "invasion force" that was set to arrive in just a couple of years, etc. With Season 2 (and an entirely new production team), all the carefully constructed work that went into Season 1 was tossed out the window. Half the characters were killed (including the villains of Season 1), several angles were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">simply forgotten about</a> and the theme of the show even changed. When fans tuned out (which caused the series to end its run prematurely), several arcs from Season 1 were left unresolved and there were more questions than answers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> seemed to have this problem. Rather than simply go the episodic or mini-arc route, the producers introduced a half-dozen secret soap opera storylines at once, storylines that sometimes overshadow the genuinely dramatic plotlines on the show. While this may not have been the only reason the series was cut short, it certainly didn't help.
</li><li> The series' predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em> eventually began to head in this direction, although <em>Atlantis</em> was still far more episodic than <em>Universe</em> ever was, which may be part of the reason <em>Atlantis</em> ran for 5 seasons to <em>Universe</em>'s 1.5.
</li><li> SG1 and SGA had arcs too, it's just that <em>Universe</em> was <em>about</em> the soap opera storylines, and the "run-down spaceship we can't actually steer" setting was just the reason why they were all crammed into the same place. Even the planets they visited to collect supplies were always uninhabited - going through the Stargate doesn't mean "Soap opera over, enter the new Goa'uld/Ori/Wraith!" but instead "the same argument from before is continued in the desert." The sci-fi plots anyone who was watching because it was <em>Stargate</em> wanted to see were <em>never</em> intended to take center stage, and the clearer that became, the fewer people watched.
</li><li> The Stargate franchise's biggest offender was The Ancients. Introduced in season 1 as 1 of 4 unnamed old and intelligent races, they gradually grew in scope, with each new addition making their backstory a bit more convoluted. Atlantis's addition that they had left the Milky Way after the plague, leaving it to repopulate itself, didn't break things too badly. But when Season 9<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4yzc4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4yzc4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4yzc4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Seasons 9 &amp; 10 were originally slated to be a spin-off series, but the network was afraid it wouldn't bring in as many viewers so they tacked it onto SG1 as additional seasons</span> retconned their origin right out of the Milky Way entirely and turned them into a splinter faction that had fled here from a distant galaxy to pursue science instead of religion 10s of millions of years prior, well, things just got nuts. Then came Universe...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>'s third season was admitted to have been written purely episode to episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">by show creator</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan">Vince Gilligan</a>. While the honesty was appreciated, the pacing of the episodes in the season was painfully turbulent from week to week, and there was certainly a lot of purposeless building of characters who just ended up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a>. The series in general ran on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">Writing by the Seat of Your Pants</a> (with the exception of season 2, which <em>was</em> planned out in advance and <em>still</em> manages to end with a contrived, pointless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffhangerCopout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffhangerCopout">Cliffhanger Copout</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>' final season was one of the most infamous cases ever. Owing partly to the brief episode count (only 6 episodes!), the development was considered rushed, to say the least. Characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot">traversed Westeros quicker than they had any right to</a>, and Daenerys exhibited an incredibly rapid descent into madness that many claim could have been telegraphed a lot better with more episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> has an infamous amount of this and it has gotten worse as the seasons have gone on. It is common for them to stretch a single question across an entire series. A running joke amongst fans is that Jax always says he will get to the bottom of something, but doesn't. Season 6 is particularly directionless both due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">FX letting every episode be 90 minutes or longer</a> leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">a surplus of pointless subplots in every episode</a> and the planned season long Big Bad having to be offed four episodes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">due to the actor's schedule</a>. Thanks to this there is no main driving conflict for much of the season but instead several plotlines piled on top of one another with none really taking primacy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEvent">The Event</a></em> was like a drinking game of both characters informing each other of things we already know and ineffectively teasing us. "You know what happened last time!" Um, we don't, so how about you tell us?
<ul><li> As mentioned in a few other places, <em>The Event</em> was so bad about building itself up that some felt it hit tropes like this one <strong>before it ever premiered.</strong> Seriously, for months, viewers were subjected to the upcoming "event", often several times per commercial break. By the time it aired, many were so annoyed with the campaign they either lost interest, thinking it couldn't possibly live up to the hype it created for itself, or just didn't watch out of spite for taking up so much of their time.
</li><li> Ironically, the show's creator had planned the story arcs to unfold over five seasons, and promised in his tweets after the first episode that the show would resolve most of its mysteries within an episode or two of introducing them&#151;which it generally did. Due to declining ratings during the fall, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">NBC forced him</a> to speed up his timetable after the hiatus so that plot developments he had planned for the second season instead took place during the second half of the first, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">predictable results</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKilling">The Killing</a></em> eventually answered the central question of "Who killed Rosie Larsen?" at the end of Season 2. Problem is, throughout Season 1, fans started to feel that the show kept throwing out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>... and when the season finale finished with nary a hint as to who might actually be responsible, professional critics actually <em>flipped their shit</em>, with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aoltv.com/2011/06/19/the-killing-season-1-season-finale-recap/">at least one<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> saying they had absolutely no reason to want to keep watching.
<ul><li> Thankfully, they averted this in Season 3, and the killer was revealed (as promised) in the same season.
</li></ul></li><li> Semi-enforced on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>: although the creators intricately plot out certain subplots during each season in advance, they were never guaranteed more than one season at a time, so they were forced to keep their options open enough to be capable of making shit up for how Ted met his kids' mother in case they got cancelled. When they were guaranteed two more seasons near the end of Season 6, the show visibly hiked up the foreshadowing (mainly in the form of flashforwards and/or Future!Ted casually Jossing possibilities or stating facts about the future) of a far denser and more detailed plot in the later episodes of Season 6 and the earlier ones of Season 7. Still, Season 9 <em>is</em> the end.
<ul><li> This was actually referenced as a common criticism of the series finale. The show ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire nine-season story being a thinly veiled excuse for Ted to justify to his kids that he's going to get back together with "Aunt Robin" after the mother/Tracy's death</span>. The footage used for this reveal was actually shot during season two, as the kids look <em>much</em> younger than they are in the rest of the clips from said finale. The reveal was criticized by people for being a last-minute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> in a series that had seen all manner of extraneous storylines, Ted going through numerous relationships and eventually coming to the realization that he would never have Robin (and seeing her literally floating away in his mind after they both realized that love just wasn't enough) and a decade's worth of characterization in the interim. Fans complained that the only way the ending made sense is if you disregarded the last eight seasons of development, and the poor reception may have been a factor in why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em>How I Met Your Father</em> got stuck in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> (due to viewers shying away from another long-term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that never pays off).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> headed this way during Seasons 6-7. Since the showrunner changed at the end of Season 5, fans in general have become increasingly less happy with the course the show is taking, feeling that the new showrunner had abolished most of the important plot threads <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and as of Season 7 secondary characters</span> that were popular with the fandom and a large part of the show's success in previous seasons, and is now relying purely on a series of one-shot guest stars to maintain viewers. In addition to the showrunner's apparent insistence on writing out well-loved characters in favour of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">poorly received</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">suspiciously similar substitutes</a>, this approach has not worked as intended.
<ul><li> General consensus seems to that since Sara Gamble's departure and Jeremy Carver's debut, the show - while still not as good as the earliest seasons - has managed to get back on course, having completely abandoned the boring Leviathan mythology, and returning to the Angel and Demon mythology.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original incarnation of the series, Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy's tenure was marked by the Lungbarrow Plot (aka the Cartmel Masterplan), a multi-season story arc designed to reset the continuity of the series and re-establish the mystery of the title character. This really was written in advance, and the payoff for the audience really was there... until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> led to the show being cancelled early. The seeds which began to be sown in Season 25 continued to grow in the subsequent <em>New Adventures</em> novels (leading to a wonderful climax in, appropriately, <em>Lungbarrow</em>)... but never addressed in the 2005 revival thus far.
</li><li> Series 7B had to contend with the aftermath of old companions leaving, the Doctor possibly leaving his travels, the Doctor possibly being on his very last incarnation, meaning a way had to be found for their life to be extended to allow a new incarnation to replace Matt Smith, <em>and</em> the retconning of the Last Great Time War. The resultant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin">"Impossible Girl"</a> arc was criticized for robbing new companion Clara of some much needed character development in favor of tying up some plot threads, and was followed by establishing a <em>new yet old</em> incarnation of the Doctor to be responsible for the Last Great Time War ending in the 50th anniversary special. Finally, the Christmas special had to wrap up <em>everything else</em> in the Eleventh Doctor era (namely the Silence arc) rather abruptly. Much of this resulted in calls for showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> to leave.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note598ny');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note598ny" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note598ny');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In fairness, he himself admitted via an interview in <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em> that this was a mess, and that he had been trying to run two shows <em>and</em> work out the 50th anniversary all at the same time, making it a variation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>. </span>
</li><li> Moffat however remained for Series 8-10, the Twelfth Doctor era, which didn't have <strong>as</strong> bad a case of this trope going &mdash; Series 8 and 9 actually spent a lot of time patching up leftover plot threads from 7B, such as the identity of the woman in the shop who brought the Doctor and Clara together (and from there how and why she did so) and Clara's personality. Series 9 went on to use its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> get the Doctor back to Gallifrey at last</span> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> to reveal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the circumstances of the Doctor and River's final night/proper wedded life</span>, partially because Moffat went into the season intending it as his last. But come Series 10 he never did resolve the <em>new</em> plot threads that the Series 9 finale left dangling regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gallifrey and the Doctor's relationship to it</span> in favor of giving this Doctor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>, his complex relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Missy, a proper conclusion.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in the expanded universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>, believe it or not. On the Richard Castle website, Castle wrote an article about what he called a Ponzi Plot. He explained that if you don't eventually resolve it, you lose your viewers.
<ul><li> This was posted a week before the Season 4 finale, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Castle and Beckett finally resolve their four-year will they/won't they arc by doing it</span>.
</li><li> Left still unresolved at that point was the mystery of the Case of Beckett's Mom, which many fans had also claimed was an example of this trope. Some fans speculate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Andrew Marlowe</a> posted the article not to explain why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Castle and Beckett finally hooked up</span> but instead to reassure fans that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Beckett case really does have a solution, that it won't drag on forever, and the viewers really will like it</span>. Sure enough, while this case still hasn't actually been <em>closed</em>, the mystery was solved in the Season 5 premiere.
</li><li> It helps that <em>Castle</em> is primarily episodic, and so has never depended on its meta-plot to keep viewers interested. The show-runners were never worried that the fans would lose interest, and sure enough reactions have been very positive.
</li><li> And now with the end of season 6, the storyline about Beckett's mother's murder has also been resolved.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>. The show kept dicking around with viewers wanting to see Clark's development into Superman by focusing more on his on-again off-again relationship with Lana most of the time, and then by the time she was finally gone from the series in Season 8 they still managed to get renewed two more times and drag things. It didn't help that they also seemed to be finding increasingly complicated ways of making Clark do "Superman" things without actually coming out and making him Superman. The series finale wasn't exactly that satisfactory to certain sections of the fanbase either.
<ul><li> Of course, since <em>Smallville</em> is a prequel to the Superman mythos, they actually knew <em>exactly</em> where all the key plotlines were going&mdash;it's just, since it took <em>ten whole seasons</em> to get there, they ended up coming up with any number of sub-plots to fill up the space; in that regard, it's actually an inversion. At the end of season 4 onwards&mdash;likely, longer than they expected the show to last&mdash;they changed tack and began bringing in supporting characters and villains that Clark would normally only have met <em>after</em> he left Smallville, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a> and Lois Lane (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>, in some versions, really did live in Smallville and was friends with Clark, so he made sense). By the end of the show he's met most of his major allies and villains <em>and</em> started the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica">Justice League</a>, all before he even puts on the cape!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> also suffered this as it went on, as several plots and characters got discarded and forgotten about in favor of new ones with each passing season.
</li><li> Nearly every plot thread in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em> is left unresolved, be it the fate of Claudia Brown, the motivations of the villain in Series 2, the origin of the future city in Series 3, the significance of Patrick Quinn, etc. No matter how significant something is played up in one series, you can be sure it'll be forgotten about in the next one. Rather than try to resolve any of them, the latest series ended by introducing a completely out-of-the-blue twist merely for the sake of a cliffhanger, and given it's unlikely to be renewed for another series, it's unlikely even <em>that</em> will ever be expanded on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>. The Red John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> has become far more elaborate and convoluted than originally intended. While it appears that Bruno Heller always knew who Red John was going to be (or picked his possible choices early on, at least), the character went from a particularly devious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who knew how to cover his tracks, to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who knew a few other killers, to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> with a shadow army of fanatically devoted, loyal-unto-death brainwashed followers. In season 6 they took his catchphrase ("Tiger, Tiger") and decided to turn what looked like a cult into a sophisticated criminal organization that nobody had heard of, and made Red John a possible member, to a possible <em>senior</em> member, and finally into the apparent mastermind of the whole thing. Oh, and he's repeatedly performing "psychic" feats that make Jane look like an amateur, that are never explained. Beyond a certain point he's basically a supervillain and you have to start wondering why he ever resorted to anything as trivial as serial murder in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sherriff McCallister</span> only raised further issues, as many clues that were dropped about Red John turn out to be irrelevant (his height, for instance&mdash;the actor in question is taller than Red John was stated to be). Practically all of the clues that pointed to him were only dropped in the sixth season, the one he was revealed in; most ones from previous seasons were never mentioned again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>:
<ul><li> This was an unfortunate side-effect of the 24-hour format. The producers often had to write storylines in advance, and would often resort to filler or sidestories to kill time until the next important revelation. Likewise, the villains almost always changed midway through the season, which often threw out the carefully-set up goals and motivations for the enemies and often resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> being revealed and fans getting tired of it, even if it made no sense in the long run.
</li><li> Done by necessity in Season 1. The production team had no idea if they would be renewed for the back half of the season, so they closed off the storyline by having Jack rescue his wife and daughter in the thirteenth episode and all plots being tied up. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieferSutherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KieferSutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a> won a Best Actor Golden Globe and the show was suddenly renewed thanks to the hype, the producers suddenly had to throw in a number of ridiculous plotlines (including a heretofore-unrevealed second assassin showing up who is having a relationship with one of his target's staff members, Jack butting heads with a sniper who hates him for something he did in the past, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuntCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuntCasting">Stunt Casting</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisHopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DennisHopper">Dennis Hopper</a>, Teri's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Easy Amnesia</a>, Kim getting kidnapped <em>again</em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nina was the mole in CTU</span>).
</li><li> The eventual resolution of the three-season arc that began with the assassinations in Season 5, made of equal parts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>. It is revealed that the businessman Alan Wilson- a character introduced near the end of season 7 and defeated within a handful of episodes- is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">ultimate enemy</a> overseeing a chain that passes down from himself, controlling a cabal that includes Jonas Hodges (who was working with Benjamin Juma to overthrow the White House), controlling another group led by Jack's brother Graem (being controlled by his father, who is working with the Chinese government), who is advising <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a> Charles Logan (which was itself caused by one of the writers asking midway through the fifth season, "Hey, what if the President was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">evil</a>?) and finally to the group of assassins that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murdered David Palmer and Michelle Dessler</span>. The failure of season 6 (and the stalling plot arc that was created by this mess) is what forced the show to undergo a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a> and move to the other side of the country in order to get things moving and resolve it. Even then, most fans weren't happy with the outcome - Wilson becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> who basically gets away scot-free with his crimes. While the show generally implied that <em>someone</em> was the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> behind these various villains and events, the character of Wilson was a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> as he was an entirely new bad guy who had an at-best tenuous connection to a handful of characters, before being very quickly captured and the whole arc being declared wrapped up afterwards. He never appears again on the show.
</li></ul></li><li> A major factor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution">Revolution</a></em> only lasting two seasons. Season one piled on the secrets and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macguffin">macguffins</a> (Who killed the power, how did they do it and why? What are the pendants? Why can they restore power just like that) while answering very few questions. Season two simply ignored many of S1's questions while adding all new questions (Sentient nanomachines?) and not answering those questions either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnderTheDome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnderTheDome">Under the Dome</a></em> is one of the most extreme examples since the turn of the millennium. While the first season was reasonably coherent in its storytelling, the next two quickly turned into an utterly incomprehensible mess of dangling plot threads, introduced new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> twists in every other episode, almost never resolved anything, and even in the rare case some question was answered, the solution was usually far-fetched to the extreme while creating a whole bunch of new mysteries that never went anywhere. It's little wonder the series rapidly lost market shares and was cancelled after three seasons, although - credit where it's due - the final episodes did their damndest to resolve the story in a satisfying way. Viewers are split on how well it managed to do that, but points for trying anyway.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a> has this in spades, particularly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>. What didn't help matters is the first season of both shows were focused on a very specific arc at the centre of the characters' motivation, the Undertaking conspiracy with Arrow, and who killed Nora Allen in Flash. Once those were resolved, the writers didn't really have any plans going forward, so they've largely just made shit up as they go along.
<ul><li> In <em>Arrow</em>'s case, this started in the third season, first by killing off Sara Lance, the Canary, in order to create a subplot where they have to solve her murder and inspire her sister to follow in her footsteps, thus abandoning Sara's own arc (though this itself had already been abandoned when after half a season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a> moments, she rejoins the League of Assassins and her 'happy ending' is going back to the cult that made her hate herself). Alongside this, Oliver's life is imploded by the League of Assassins...except they didn't really know <em>why</em> the League of Assassins wanted to mess with him, going from 'its his fault Sara died', 'he's protecting Malcolm', and 'they want Ollie to be Ra's heir'. In the end, they also reveal that the League of Assassins will wipe out the city, in order to erase Oliver's history, which <em>completely flies against their beef with Malcolm</em> since the <em>whole entire reason</em> they had for wanting him dead was he tried to destroy the City, and this was 'against their code'.
<ul><li> Season 4 was no better in this regard, and its made worse since it deals with several building myth arcs concerning Hive, Damien Darhk, and Andy Diggle. Adding to matters, the viewer finds out one member of Team Arrow is going to die, but the identity of who is a mystery to the viewer, and also the writers because they later admitted they didn't have anyone actually planned. Several other subplots are set up and never resolved, while the grave plot is resolved by killing off Laurel Lance, with the writers citing the fact her story was 'done', despite her character having <em>literally</em> just been set up with a power boost, a potential new status quo of working for the mayor's office to infiltrate Darhk's operation, the fact she'd began to realise she was still in love with Oliver, and being the team's most personal connection to Nyssa Al Ghul, meaning so much set up for her character goes nowhere. A lot of viewers gave up on the show after this point, and it continued to bleed viewership as time went on.
</li><li> The Black Canary mantle ends up being something of a character-specific example of this. Initially the role of the Black Canary is Sara Lance, who as noted above was set up as someone who hated herself and wanted to escape an assassin cult. After most of a season of her learning to love herself and that she's more than just a killer, she's sent off back to the assassin cult. When she returns, she's killed off so her sister Laurel can take over. Laurel spends a season building up to becoming the Black Canary and improving, is set up with several building sub-plots, then killed off. Her death leaves a void and they decide to try and fill it with a <em>new</em> Black Canary, and introduce a metahuman police officer to fill that void, though then she later gets depowered in order to make way for an alternate universe Laurel who until that point had been a remorseless killer who now suddenly doesn't like being a killer. Ultimately the mantle is just a series of characters who's plots are cut off so they can be replaced, leading to a long, convoluted legacy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Flash</em> started this with Zoom. Zoom's exact motivation is never consistent between episodes, with him initially seemingly wanting to kill Barry simply to have no challenger to the Fastest Man Alive title, then revealing he <em>actually</em> wanted to make Barry <em>faster</em> so he could drain his speed. This turns out to be because Zoom destroyed his body with a speed-enhancing drug that he's dying from, and needs Barry's speed to fix himself, but when he gets that speed he <em>then</em> decides that his actual plan was to take over their earth 'like he did Earth 2' (despite what we see showing he was just a gang leader who terrorised <em>one</em> city, that was still in good enough condition that its police force were actively fighting back). Only <em>then</em> it turns out he was actually planning to destroy the multiverse and leave Earth 1 to torment, which he was somehow now smart enough to do. The repeated changes to his motivation and powers leads to plots coming and going out of nowhere, while also having other subplots, like the introduction of Wally West and Jesse Quick, being dragged out so their characters' hero origin get delayed.
<ul><li> Savitar in the next season was even worse, as exactly <em>who and what</em> Savitar <em>is</em> gets dragged on for the entire season without explaining what it is Savitar even wants. Meanwhile Wally and Jesse get their powers, but the show does what it can to avoid letting them rise as heroes in order to keep Barry relevant, introduces a new Rogues who are never developed or made real use of, and has Caitlin develop ice powers and make her begin to become Killer Frost, but its never explained <em>why</em> her developing powers is exactly a bad thing, with her changing her mind between being murderously desperate to remove her powers to being murderously desperate to <em>remain</em> empowered, with a split personality later developing in a poor attempt to explain that. This continues into future seasons with the exact origin of Killer Frost getting rebooted multiple times, while subsequent big-bads continue the trend of having mysterious plans that are never revealed, only to be suddenly changed out of nowhere when they do.

<ul><li> Pro wrestling has its own jargon for this: "hotshot" booking. This is when a show is literally written as it is being performed, either because the writers aren't prepared, a wrestler is suddenly unable to work a match during a live show requiring an abrupt change in his angle, or because the bookers are trying to be daring and edgy. Hotshot booking rarely produces anything but failure, however.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a>-booked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Summer of Suck</a> in 1999 WCW featured the "Who drove the Hummer?" angle which was never resolved. Crossed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">They Wasted a Perfectly Good Plot</a>, since, once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SidEudy">Sid Vicious</a> returned at <em>WCW The Great American Bash 99</em>, all they needed to say was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a> had hired Sid to drive the Hummer to crash into Nash's limo to injure him to make it easier for Savage to defeat Nash for the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wcw/wcw-h.html">WCW World Heavyweight Title<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Eric Bischoff was notorious for this during the Monday Night War. He would often rewrite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a></em> while it was actually airing to counter-program WWF's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">Raw</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a> became an even more notorious example during his stint as writer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> toward the end of the Monday Night War. Characters turned and won and lost titles so often that fans lost track, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">numerous angles were abandoned midstream</a> (most famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a>'s "pregnancy"), wrestlers would retire "forever" only to show up next episode (quick even by wrestling standards). There is a reason bad and nonsensical booking leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crowdchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crowdchant">chants</a> of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">Fire Russo!</a>" even in promotions he's never worked for. There's also a reason Russo was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a>- he was more interested in <em>surprising</em> the audience than <em>entertaining</em> them.
</li><li> At <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, the concept was put in writing as part of the company's "Wellness Program", which states that any "Superstar" fired for doping offenses must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">job</a> his or her title/finish an angle in the ring immediately and without pay.
<ul><li> This was demonstrated in 2009, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio</a> was given a Wellness Vacation and dropped the Intercontinental Championship he was holding at the time to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a> (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">promptly caused some fans to complain</a> about Rey not dropping the title to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>, who'd been in the hunt for the title for some time).
</li></ul></li><li> Injuries force a not <em>quite</em> as urgent example of this trope, too. Injured wrestlers can usually finish the match they're in (unless the injury is really bad), but they won't be back next week, and if they were in the middle of a storyline you've got a week (if you're lucky) to rewrite it. An example from the WWE: in 2009, Edge and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> had formed a tag team, won the Unified Tag Team Championships, and were just starting off an arrogant heel run with the belts...and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> tore his Achilles tendon, putting him on the shelf for the rest of the year. WWE Creative, backed into a pretty unpleasant corner, had Jericho cut a promo on Edge for having the gall to get injured during their title run; he then hyped up his new mystery partner (who was much better than Edge)...who he'd be debuting at the next PPV. This bought them enough time to actually get a new story together.
<ul><li> In that example, it actually worked out great, as Jericho's partner was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a>, and the team (known as "JeriShow") went on to dominate the tag team division for a good part of the year.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A subsect of hotshot booking is "hotshot" title changes - title changes that happen fairly quickly and result in a number of different title reigns, often for no real reason. Like with hotshot booking, this is done either to cover for an injury or to change an angle on the fly. Unfortunately, such title changes - if they happen too often - can "devalue" the belts (in other words, fans will stop caring about who holds the titles, and thus stop caring about seeing wrestlers compete for the titles, making them worthless as an attraction). These kinds of title changes can also become somewhat predictable if used very often; if you know the belt's going to change hands every other week, why even bother to watch the champion defend their title? Hotshot title changes are one of the many reasons WCW is now out of business, and it's one of the many, many, many, many, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">many</a> reasons TNA is so reviled amongst a good majority of the IWC.
<ul><li> An example of a hotshot title change from 2009: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JillianHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JillianHall">Jillian Hall</a> defeats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> to win the Divas Championship on the October 12 <em>Raw</em>. Her title reign lasts just a few short minutes, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Melina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Melina">Melina</a> - just traded to <em>Raw</em> from <em>Smackdown</em> - comes in and wins the title in short order. (Of course, it was around this time rumors of WWE punishing Mickie for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">being too fat</a> and/or behavioral issues came to light, which caused some fans to look at the hotshot reign as a punishment: rather than drop the title to Melina and look good in the process, Mickie dropped it to Jillian - essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> in WWE's Divas division - and had to watch Melina win it minutes later.)
</li><li> One of the funniest examples prior to its retirement was the Hardcore Championship belt, which also carried a 24/7 defense rule - whoever owned the belt had to be paranoid about being ambushed anytime, anywhere, with such highlights as Crash Holly fighting off two opponents at Fun Times USA (a children's indoor playground), or the rapid-fire changing of the title during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 18, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a> wound up holding it for a brief span after unwittingly knocking out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDoorSlamsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDoorSlamsYou">with a door</a>.

<ul><li> Some have accused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaNomura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaNomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> of doing this with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series. Each new game ties up the previous one's loose ends, but opens up twice as many new ones...
<ul><li> The series was deliberately designed with plot holes to fill because Nomura was unsure if it would really be worth it to make a sequel to the original game, and also because he wanted his fans to create their own theories about how things happened (which he succeeded at). Nomura then confirmed that he always will make plot holes and bizarre, mysterious elements in a game, and make up the explanations while working on the next game. Rinse and repeat.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series seems to be suffering from a fatal case of Chris Carter. Eidos never really knew what to do with it after Crystal Dynamics stole it from Silicon Knights (and told SK to throw their carefully-plotted story ideas for a sequel in the trash). Crystal Dynamics' next decision with the franchise, having multiple titles in development at the same time with different teams working on them, did little to gel any sort of solid story. The meat of the stories after the first game seemed to follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">immortal, nigh-indestructible evolving vampires</a> traveling through time and fighting extra-dimensional demons. The series' timeline spans thousands of years, and each additional game either flagrantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">reset buttons</a> the previous installations, including at least one cliffhanger ending that not only drew cries of the game being released incomplete but wasn't actually resolved in the next game. It still could turn out to be one of the greatest series ever, provided they manage to put a bow on it. However, so far news from the developer seems to suggest that another sequel is unlikely.
<ul><li> One example: all the events of <em>Blood Omen 2</em> (released 4th) happen between the events of <em>Blood Omen</em> and <em>Soul Reaver</em> (released 1st and second) in a timeline created in <em>Defiance</em> (released 5th) and destroyed in <em>Soul Reaver 2</em> (released 3rd).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series is working on averting this after having fallen into this trope for a time. In its first decade, many elements of the universe were introduced and then never brought up again, such as what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> Forerunner Crystal from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloFirstStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloFirstStrike">Halo: First Strike</a></em> was supposed to be, how many Spartans had survived to the present, what happened to the <em>Spirit of Fire</em> after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloWars">Halo Wars</a></em>, etc. After the series was turned over from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThreeFourThreeIndustries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThreeFourThreeIndustries">343 Industries</a>, the new studio began a <em>massive</em> effort to finally give answers to all the loose threads, sometimes by the dozens within the same work.
</li><li> Any new partner characters, second-string villains, or "B" plots in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series are typically met with derision because, so far, only one out of nearly a dozen of these characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNonEntity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelNonEntity">has ever reappeared in any other games</a>. As a rule, many fans tend not to get too invested into these characters when they know they'll just end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> was accused of this, as early as the Ezio trilogy. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> even <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/video_19740_why-assassins-creed-makes-absolutely-no-sense.html">made fun of the series<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for falling into this trope, alleging that its status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a> ensures that there will never be a proper end to the story.
<ul><li> Many fans were expecting Desmond to get his own game set in the modern era, as the first few games clearly point towards the character being trained in the Assassin arts and getting better at fighting Abstergo agents. This took a hard right turn in the fifth main game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em>, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Desmond haphazardly sacrifices himself in a last-minute twist to save the world</span>. As of 2016, there have been four main games since then (not to mention numerous tie-in games), and this aspect of the plot hasn't been addressed at all, instead being focused on periphery characters who are sneaking around ostensibly finding out little tidbits of information about Abstergo. It got to the point that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity">Assassin's Creed: Unity</a></em> had <em>no scenes at all in the present day</em>, instead being a simulation run entirely through a console by two Assassins who act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>. This may have been the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> opted to slow down the production schedule of the series in 2016 and take a longer time to complete each installment.
</li><li> ... and then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Juno">Juno<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the mysterious entity who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Desmond sacrificed himself for</span> in <em>III</em>. At the end of the game, she promised to help save the world, but as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedSyndicate">Assassin's Creed: Syndicate</a></em>, all she's done is float around computer systems and give cryptic information to various parties. It doesn't help matters that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> is so complicated and stretched out across so many games that it requires reading a wiki page to understand it, and the goal of the entity can be boiled down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">stealing a human body so she can inhabit it</a>.
</li><li> The resolution of Lucy's character. In the first few games, Lucy was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>/sidekick who initially busted Desmond out of Abstergo and helped him fight against them. The first three games had a relatively consistent character arc for her, but when voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell">Kristen Bell</a> left the franchise during production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedBrotherhood">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</a></em>, the writers threw in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> that had <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Desmond randomly stab her at the urging of Juno</span>. The writers then promised that there would answers to this plot twist, but it wasn't fully answered until the "Lost Archive" DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a></em> two years later &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out she was a triple agent, who decided to break Desmond out despite actively working for the Templars and doing villainous things</span>. Part of the fanbase was angry for the haphazard conclusion, and it's clear that this twist and revelation made no sense in the overall narrative.
<ul><li> This was also annoying for the reason that in order to learn this, you had to get and play through the DLC (which used a platforming system different than the main series). If you didn't bother with the DLC, then you wouldn't learn why until <em>ACIII</em> and even then you'd just have people referring to her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a traitor</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em>:

There's also the fact that a box which, quoth Scott, contained "all the pieces put together," ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret">left unopened</a> as opposed to being unlocked with a later update as initially planned.

<ul><li> Though some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> would later clarify the spoiler above. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Specifically, that Springtrap <em>is</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>, and not his son, as previously believed.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Finally</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreddyFazbearsPizzeriaSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreddyFazbearsPizzeriaSimulator">sixth game</a>, which actually answered most of the above questions and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">resolves the plot by having all the souls trapped inside the animatronics be released, and their souls pass onto the next world.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> has a fairly interesting plot about the titular organization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether">Putting the Band Back Together</a> while the nefarious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization">Talon</a> gathers its forces and stokes tensions while the world limps toward a second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Robot War</a>. As an exclusively multiplayer title, this story is told through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">external sources</a> released sporadically online. Very sporadically. The kind of sporadic that means the rate of actual progress is better measured by <em>seasons</em> rather than by weeks or months. Nowhere is this more evident than with the issue of seeing Overwatch itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderReborn">reformed</a>, the core premise upon which the lore has built itself. A story cinematic released in March of 2016 established that a "recall" order had been issued to all former operatives to call them back into service and rebuild the organization. The issue of the recall then sat dormant and unmentioned for <em>seventeen months</em> until another story cinematic released in August of 2017 confirmed <em>one</em> new agent to respond. And during the interim, developments consisted mostly of the villains effortlessly pursuing their agenda and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride">undoing the heroes' few victories</a> while the latter either failed to stop them or accomplished little of consequence at all. So, not only does the lore progress at a glacial rate, but the progress it <em>does</em> make is often trivial or demoralizing. Even fans who were enthusiastic with following the story from day one have grown increasingly fatigued and skeptical of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment">Blizzard's</a> ability or intent to follow through with their promises, especially since the tone of the lore has gradually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">become more melancholy with very little worth cheering for</a>.
<ul><li> To top it off, the often <em>long</em> periods between new releases compound the issue with a meta effect: when new information comes out, it will often clash with long-standing and cherished <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fan theories</a> that have developed in the meantime<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0e1di');"><sup>Just an exemple&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0e1di" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0e1di');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was initially assumed that Mercy had something to do with Reaper's state, more often than theorized to be a failed attempt at saving his life, until a year and a half after launch, where it was revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">newcomer Moira</a> was actually responsible for it.</span>, inevitably resulting in a backlash that drives some fans to either stop theorycrafting or stick to their guns and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">ignore what contradicts them.</a> Either way, morale in the lore-minded sections of the community is often volatile.

<ul><li> A common problem for long-running webcomics with an overarching plot.

Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a> this may make finishing the comic within the author's lifetime highly unlikely and may lead to the comic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/OrphanedSeries/Webcomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/OrphanedSeries/Webcomics">being dropped by the author</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> After some 1,200 comics, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em> foursome could probably have figured out a clever way to defeat Chaos and win the day as they did with all their other extremely powerful foes, but the story instead had them depowered and sent off somewhere to muck about, formulating some kind of plan to go back up against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> There was some fear that this would happen to the venerable <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.goats.com">Goats<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> would fall into this as the Infinite Typewriters Mega-Arc continued to add weirdness. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">John Rosenburg</a> has assured us that it's all mapped out to 2012... despite the announcement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">the strip ending afterwards</a>.

He has been trying to get things sorted out by establishing things alluded to and having situations progress, as well as having several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallMailSlot">Fourth-Wall Mail Slot</a> bits between stories and a renewed effort to keep the strip updating 6 times a week (his 2012 average is probably 3.5 a week, which is pretty good, all things considered), so we'll have to see how he does.

Creator Paul Taylor claims that it's all part of an extended story that he plotted at the comic's start; but many think he's simply making it up as he goes. The fact that all of the subplots and storylines involving the various personal relationships were unceremoniously dropped shortly after the start of the Golem Girls arc, with no attempt at a resolution, would seem to support this opinion. A few believe that the increasingly bizarre supernatural recent events may indicate something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a>.

The plot points are introduced and wildly discarded, except it's acknowledged and played for laughs by the characters.

<ul><li> Many of the plot elements from Season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Lonelygirl15" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a></em> seem to have been completely forgotten. Cassie, anyone?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/KateModern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/KateModern">KateModern</a></em> is much more successful in this regard, but still left a few threads hanging at the end.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a> was supposed to run more-or-less in real time, and staying ahead of the actual date... but the series started in 2004 and has barely gotten into Winter Term of the <em>first year</em> of school, with some stories still stuck back in the Fall. Some fans are wondering if the authors will live long enough to finish the main story arc. It's been joked that the stories will wrap up any century now.
<ul><li> And it has now hemorrhaged just about all of the original authors, except for Bek. With Diane Castle, the main person who moved things forward for three years, gone, it teetered on the edge of becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadFic">Dead Fic</a>, until several new writers infused it with fresh blood (and a few earlier writers started talk of returning).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets">Marble Hornets</a> is a found-footage format series whose driving force was the events behind the titular student film. However, even after the initial fourteen entries that establish the initial mystery, things don't let up from there and Jay's own investigations end up adding mystery after mystery. Parts of the larger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> included the Masked Men, Jay's enigmatic stalker totheark, the whereabouts of the mysterious girl Jessica whom Jay meets in season two, and of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos">the Operator</a> itself. By the end of the series, many of these are left unexplained or open to interpretation. Much like <em>Lost</em>, how effective this was depends on whether you prefer the show being left open to interpretation or having these answers explained.
<ul><li> In an interesting case for this trope, the creators of the series were honest with themselves in that they had no initial idea for a long-term plan to the series, and most of the mysteries created in season one where done so more out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary">Rule of Scary</a> rather than any necessity to the plot or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> (considering the show was made on a whim and they planned on wrapping it up at the end of the first season, it makes sense). However, once production on season two started, they decided they would up the ante and actually make sense of those non-nonsensical ideas they initially made.

The following three seasons are elaborate dream sequences within the coma where Archer imagines himself and the other main characters in different settings. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Series creator Adam Reed</a> has even gone on record saying he's not sure he wants Archer to ever wake up. This has caused quite a bit of frustration among fans, many of whom see the dream sequences as pointless filler, or feel that Reed is no longer invested in the actual story and world of Archer and is merely using the show to push other ideas with the established characters.
