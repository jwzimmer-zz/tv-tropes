</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewMazinger">New Mazinger</a></em>. The trope is definitely subverted in this <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> spin-off. At the beginning, Mazinger easily defeats with a sword a bunch of mechas armed with laser blades, ray guns and missile launchers... However Mazinger later faced an army not even used firearms. Mazinger was loaded with clusters of missiles. He easily annihilated them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em>. Rak and his spear easily took out Levin and his Sniper Rifle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScopeSnipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScopeSnipe">Literally, the thing fell to pieces</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersRobotsInDisguise">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em>, the Predacons attempt to steal an antique steam train which is being guarded by Team Bullet Train. Gas Skunk fires an EMP pulse which disables Rail Spike and Rapid Run, but has no effect on the steam train due it its lack of electronic components. Also, Sky Bite, Dark Scream, and Slapper are all disabled by smoke from its chimney.
</li><li> As a result of the predominant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiSeven">Samurai 7</a></em>, the only available weapon against a giant floating battlecruiser is... a massive sharpened pike the size of a building, hurled across miles by a giant ballista. And it WORKS.
</li><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">&forall; Gundam</a>.</em> Although the Earth Militia forces know their environment well enough to stage ambushes against the technologically superior Moonrace invaders (not to mention that solid munitions can pass through their advanced shielding), it doesn't change the fact that it's a lopsided contest. Especially given that Earth-bound humanity is using what amounts to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> technology</em> at best against enemies that can wipe out entire regiments with beam weapons. It's only after they uncover caches of mobile suits and with the Turn-A's help that they actually put up a decent fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">Space Battleship Yamato 2199</a></em> provides a few examples, thanks to the UN propensity for using firearms:
<ul><li> Small arms are firearms, and they're just as capable as the Gamilas' energy weapon equivalents;
</li><li> Fighters too are equipped with firearms as their guns, and not only the smallers guns (apparently similar to current revolver cannons) are equivalent to the Gamilas fighters energy weapons, but the larger guns are more powerful;
</li><li> The <em>Yamato</em>'s main guns are capable of operating both as the devastating shock cannons and as normal naval guns firing 'Type 3 shells'. The shells are something incredible: while short-ranged, they are just as devastating as the shock cannons, can fire indirectly, and, differently from energy weapons, can operate just fine inside portals, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wrecking Deslar's flagship when he ambushes them inside one</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PanzerWorldGalient">Panzer World Galient</a></em>. When the forces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Marder</a> -which included infantry and cavalry equipped with beam weapons and giant war mechas- invaded the capital of the Kingdom of Arst, they easily won because the Arstians were armed with nothing but swords and spears. Later on, though, a rebel army equipped with bladed weapons and reinforced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Galient</a> managed to beat Marder's war mechas.
</li><li> A case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">"Rock Beats Better Rock"</a> in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Paradis is about 50-100 years behind Marley in terms of technological level, but they absolutely <em>wreck</em> Marley's forces on the eve of Marley's war declaration against them. This is in part due to Paradis' use of ODM gear which Marley <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">has no experience fighting</a>, Paradis entrapping and delaying several of Marley's Warrior Titans so they cannot immediately react, and Eren's sudden transformation into the Attack Titan that catches the whole assembly off guard.

Snapper Carr complains that the League having a library in their base is pointless, since they also have a computer and can use it to do research much faster. But no Internet connection in the world can move faster than Flash, who has a book open to the appropriate page before Snapper even finishes typing. And could probably even run to any library in the world and back in the time it takes Google to load.

</li><li> It's a fairly common tactic for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> to use a blunt object against technologically advanced foes. This is presuming that he can't simply tear them metal limb from metal limb with his bare hands (which he usually can). Granted, the Hulk pretty much applies this tactic to any foe, regardless of the level of technology at their disposal. This is quite in line with real world physics; you can destroy anything in the universe, ANYTHING at all... if you hit it hard enough. And who could possibly hit harder than an enraged Hulk? .

<ul><li> Early during the Earth-Minbari War, the more advanced Minbari ships usually had the advantage on their EarthForce counterparts, as the more advanced technology make them faster, better armed, and hellishly difficult to hit. Once the Alpha Quadrant forces enter the scene and provide Earth Alliance with sensors that break through Minbari stealth, however, EarthForce ships have the advantage due their crews' superior skill and ability to get the drop on them, especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">railgun-equipped cruisers</a> (nicknamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">killcruisers</a> by the Minbari <em>before</em> the new sensors appeared) are involved;
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> between Alpha Quadrant ships and what the <em>Babylon 5</em> factions have, as a number of various technical advances give the Alpha Quadrant ships firepower comparable or superior to the Minbari ones and shields strong enough to resist it while much smaller;
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-zagged</a> with the old fusion-powered Romulan ships still in service and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant ships (including the newer Romulan ships), all powered by antimatter: the antimatter-powered ships are slightly more powerful and the fusion reactors of the older Romulan ships are much larger and with smaller fuel reserves to compete, but the fusion-powered ships don't suffer of the antimatter shortage.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight when the EarthForce army fights the Minbari one. Human weapons are mostly BiL-Pro (that is, improved <em>firearms</em>) or missiles, with the only advanced weapons being vehicle-mounted energy machine guns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">laser cannons</a> for use against enemy aircrafts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">artillery shells</a>, and newly-introduced tank railguns, and their ground vehicles move on tracks. Minbari weapons are mostly energy except for their artillery, that fires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">Antimatter-loaded</a> shells by gravity manipulation, and their vehicles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank">move the same way</a>. On the other hand, the former designed their equipment basing themselves on battlefield experience and are quite good at using it, while the Minbari, in their arrogance, took a long series of stupid decisions (their main tank is criticized for having its main gun fixed forward, an heat signature that makes it impossible to hide to anyone with even the most primitive heat-seeking missile, the gravity-manipulating equipment put in an unarmoured fin, and the armour plating being mechanically fragile and vulnerable to kinetic energy weapons that on the ground are used by pretty much everyone, while the antimatter-firing artillery is called out on the impracticality of only using antimatter as the shell filling) and didn't train their soldiers adequately, who had to learn how to fight effectively on the field. This results in EarthForce resisting the Minbari invasion of Cyrus for <em>years</em> in spite of the latter having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrbitalBombardment">orbital superiority and limited starship support</a>, and once the starship support is eliminated the Minbari get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">annihilated</a>.

This comes from another instance of the trope being played straight: over two centuries earlier, Minbari analysts warned that their ground equipment was outmatched by what the Centauri and Orieni had for the same reasons it's outmatched by EarthForce equipment but were ignored until the Windsword clan, to shut them up, decided to verify and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">saw they were right</a>, at which point they started a development program for a new tank with improved protection and a better and turreted main gun, with the assault tank having been literally cobbled together from the still incomplete new technologies at the start of the war to have something not completely outmatched by EarthForce vehicles;

It was even worse in the original cut of the movie.

But it doesn't actually work. Despite exploiting the predator's heat vision to his advantage, Arnold's low-tech approach fails to beat the alien. It's only when the latter decides to "even things out" by removing its multipurpose helmet and shoulder gun that Arnold manages to beat it. And even then it's more due to dumb luck more than anything. In the expanded <em>Predator</em> material, the Predators are shown to particularly enjoy hunting humans because of our ability to make rocks beat lasers. Being intelligent, wily, and resourceful makes us the second-ultimate prey.

The debate on whether holodeck-generated bullets are more phaser than bullet is something that fans debate to this day (plus, the number of Borg drones defeated by the holographic Tommy Gun is roughly equivalent to the number of drones defeated by phasers before they adapt... two). Later on in the film, Worf kills another Borg with a <em>sword</em>. He's a dangerous man-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">allegedly</a>. Indeed, people tend to fare better against the Borg in close combat in general, until assimilation occurs. But that only really comes into play when dealing with inhumanly strong people like Worf or Data. Early on, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> tries to rifle butt a Borg drone after his phaser is adapted to.

This is somewhat of a subversion. In the end the Samurai win a moral battle by showing the newer army that traditional values, especially courage against overwhelming odds, should be respected.

<ul><li> A Medieval English army, fully prepped on the eve of leaving to join King Edward's crusade, crushes a small alien invasion force, by dint of cunning, superior numbers, and having no EMP-susceptible equipment or depletable bullets/explosives/laser charges - but plenty of reusable arrows, swords, sheer brute strength and a sense of righteous Christian indignation. Then, using the captured spaceship and the grudging assistance of a surviving alien interpreter (taught <em>Latin</em> by the army's cleric), they launch a counter-invasion of the evil intergalactic empire, whom they view as the more prolific, Heaven-soiling brethren of the heretics overrunning Israel. Because the invaders to our world have been dominant for so long over such a wide area, nobody up in the stars has any damn idea what politics are any more. The human leader manages to convince every single alien he meets, through bravado, underhandedness, trickery, and good old-fashioned lying, to assail their opponents. When "future" Earth finally reaches the stars, they are met by the emissary of the trans-galactic feudal Christian empire, run by Human descendants of the would-have-been Crusaders. And it is beyond awesome. Especially when the Space duke asks the Earth captain if the Holy Land is free of the Pagans. "Um, yes" says the Captain who is a loyal servant of the Israeli Empire.
</li><li> The English have an additional advantage over the aliens: the aliens' weapons have become so advanced that they no longer have any knowledge whatsoever of hand-to-hand combat. Once the English are able to get in close quarters, the aliens don't stand a chance. It takes the English army exactly one battle to figure this out.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uplift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uplift">Uplift</a></em> series has this as a running theme. As newcomers to a galaxy filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> with eons-old technology, humanity and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">clients</a> must rely on their wits and the technology that they've learned to understand in a few short centuries. In <em>The Uplift War</em>, humans and chimps with jungle camouflage and crossbows manage to slaughter the technologically reliant Gubru &mdash; after realizing that their initial severe losses were due to the Gubru having rigged the humans' technology so they could track it. Later in the war, they also manage to capture some Gubru weapons.

<ul><li> Alternates between playing this straight and subverting it. The premise is an alien invasion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">at the height of WW2</a>, and the trope is played straight when humanity's primitive weapons prove to be immune to technologically advanced countermeasures. EMPs don't work on vacuum tubes and analog computers, and anti-missile systems designed to defeat lightweight thin-skinned rockets can't turn back massive artillery shells. Not to mention that radar is nearly useless when trying to detect a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polikarpov_Po-2">low-flying plane built from canvas and wood.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Also, the aliens' cultural ignorance of the strategic thinking and tactics (as they have not fought a war against an opponent with industrial technology in thousands of years, and their previous two conquests were tanks vs. spearmen slaughters) puts them at a disadvantage in skill and planning against even the most unimaginatively led human units.
</li><li> Some technology was simply <em>unfathomable</em> to the aliens, even though they're from outer space and have fusion at their finger tips. They never had someone twisted enough to employ gas during warfare, and hence are completely unprepared when the British decide to employ it when the Lizards invade. Their homeworld is very arid with no large bodies of water; a navy, <em>especially</em> an aircraft carrier, is completely mindboggling to them.
</li><li> Funnily enough, the Race expected the technological disparity to be even greater than it was. Their last probe was during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">The High Middle Ages</a>, and being an extremely conservative species, they expected to be fighting knights on horseback. Never did they imagine that their own tanks and planes would be fighting native models, however primitive.
</li><li> The last novel subverts this. While humanity's first starship is, essentially, a knock-off of what find out about the ships of the Race and can't even move as fast, the Race is shocked when, several weeks after its arrival to their homeworld, humanity's first FTL ship arrives, having made the trip in under a month. The Race hadn't even considered the possibility of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>.
</li><li> Interestingly, the Race then threatens humans with a more primitive technology when the arrogant new arrivals try to dictate terms. They threaten to turn their STL starships into kinetic kill vehicles by accelerating them to 50% of the speed of light and slamming them into Earth, causing extinction-level events. Sure, it'll take decades, but the humans (who have stopped developing fast STL ships in favor of FTL, won't be able to stop them.
</li></ul></li><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata">Legacy of the Aldenata</a></em>:
<ul><li> Guided weapons (or just about anything with active electronics) are easily detected and intercepted by incredibly accurate Posleen anti-aircraft fire, after which the alien hostiles return fire with generally fatal results, but unguided artillery shells are incapable of being engaged by the Posleen's weaponry, as are <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System">MLRS<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> rockets if fired so the boost phase is out of the line of sight of the enemy aliens.
</li><li> There is another, more amusing example in book from the same series <em>Yellow Eyes</em> where a group of Posleen are walking through the Mojinga Jungle in Panama and are being hunted by a lone native, who repeatedly uses stone age traps and a bow with steel-tipped arrows to kill them. This works mostly because the arrows don't have enough metal to be detected by the Posleen's sensors and are traveling too slow to be considered a threat. It's so bad the Posleen sensors can't even see the arrows embedded in the dead Posleen bodies.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in the 1959 novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>, in the chapter that discusses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">powered suits</a>. The suits are designed to be as invisible to their users as possible, for admirably common-sense reasons: "If you load a mudfoot down with a lot of gadgets that he has to watch, somebody a lot more simply equipped - say with a stone ax - will sneak up on him and bash his head in while he's trying to read a vernier." The Mobile Infantry also train with more primitive weapons, from unarmed hand-to-hand combat on up to 20th-century weaponry, partly to prepare them for using the powered battlesuits and also to prepare them for situations in which the battlesuits would be impractical.
<ul><li> The film version also touches on this, albeit in a much nastier way. A recruit questions the need to learn hand-to-hand combat when they can just kill their enemies by "pushing a button". His drill instructor responds by stabbing him through his hand, pinning him to a wall, and asking how he intends to push said button now.
</li></ul></li><li> Brutally shown in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sten">Sten</a></em>, by Allan Cole and Chris Bunch.
<ul><li> Seems that the designers overengineered their powered suits to such an extent that each one could withstand nuclear blasts, any conceivable biological or chemical agent, and could fight off any conceivable opponent &mdash; except primitive ones. When first deployed, the men in suits run rampant &mdash; until the primitives notice that they aren't very maneuverable. So, the natives start making pit traps with nets, and once the suit is ensnared in the net the natives come out and poke long spears into the suit's waste vents, skewering the troopers inside and simultaneously poisoning them with their own wastes... To their credit, Chris Bunch in Real Life is an ex-Army Ranger, where Allan Cole has diplomatic experience.
</li><li> There's an incident with a less extreme tech difference later in the series. Sten takes charge of an old but heavily-armed strongpoint. When enemy tacships try strafing and bombing his position, he activates the air-defence system, not expecting much from the archaic guns. They rip the tacships out of the sky, because the guns are targeting and the proximity fuses detonating with radar frequencies so out-of-date that <em>no one remembered to jam them anymore</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the short stories in the collection <em>The Human Edge</em> has the main character bash out the brains of an Alien who six months previously took away his language and ability to think rationally. He gets the chance to do this when he sneaks into the alien ship and the alien is so surprised that he is still alive, and considers him such a non-threat, that it turns its back to him.

This deserves some clarification, because while it is an example, it's not as bad as it looks outside of context. Melee combat with bladed weapons in the Dune universe is actually the norm, because of shielding technology that renders ranged weapons nearly useless. Although the Fremen lack such shielding technology, so it still counts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dune1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dune1984">David Lynch movie</a> kind of ruins this by actually giving the Fremen <em>more</em> advanced weapons than the Saudarkar, in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">voice-amplifying sonic guns</a>.

Plus, if you start running out of food, they're edible. If they do require maintenance, then you don't need an extra specialist, just a doctor with an extra medicine cabinet and a textbook.
</li><li> Heinlein also makes the point that tactics and initiative can be as important as technology. To paraphrase: two men face off. One has a musket, the other an assault rifle. If the man with the musket fires first (and accurately), or is a smarter fighter and uses cover well, then the assault rifle's technological advantage is rendered moot.

Indeed, the advanced-<em>against-humans</em> nature of their weapons makes the soldiers' attacks far less effective than simple bolt-action rifles would've been, as they fire in shaky bursts aiming for the head, and their sophisticated communication links only serve to spread panic, as they can see and hear their comrades being eaten. Eventually, someone realises the problem and "invents" the Lobotomiser&mdash;more or less a modified shovel. Its simplicity and effectiveness restored troop confidence in a big way. Yonkers was explicitly a tactical failure rather than a technology failure.

The American pilot thinks he can win the air war single-handed. However, his radar cannot pick up the mostly canvas-and-wood biplanes of the era, his guided missiles are useless as they are designed to lock onto jet exhausts not piston engines, his engines are fueled by what is used mainly as lamp oil and field-heater fuel, so he cannot get a sufficient regular supply, and even then needs to filter it, and his plane flies faster than bullets, so a gun cannot be fitted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually he works out that the supersonic wash from his plane is enough to rip apart the German planes he is up against.</span>
</li><li> As the protagonist of a Christopher Stasheff SF novel points out, anyone who denigrates the abilities of primitives armed with "sticks and stones" has never experienced a volley of stone-tipped arrows fired from ambush.
</li><li> In the first story arc of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deathstalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deathstalker">Deathstalker</a></em> series, slow-charging energy weapons and highly-effective energy shields have rendered the advanced weapons ineffective in ground battles. After an opening volley of disruptor fire, most soldiers charge into melee with swords. This tactic allows for a brutal example of this trope later. The protagonist's party locates a cache of "ancient" kinetic projectile weapons, including very effective machine guns. When they face an army using the standard disruptor-melee combination, they slaughter their enemy with machine gun fire when they drop their shields. The advances in technology had forced them to use primitive weaponry, which were useless against the antiquated/more advanced weapons.
<ul><li> Not exactly. Force shields will indeed block bullets just fine, but most people are used to the energy guns, which take two minutes to recharge between shots. So after an opening exchange of disrupter fire (which the force shields deflect), standard practice is to shut down the force shields to save power. One the shields are off, the rebels pop up with machine guns and mow down the advancing Imperial troops. While the "official" reason for retiring projectile weapons was that they were outperformed by energy guns and force shields, the real reason was that energy guns and force shields were more expensive, so only the nobles or Imperial military could afford them, making rebellions much more difficult. Even so, the deciding factor in most battles was the main characters insane Madness Maze powers.

The destroyer's XO orders all weapons to fire, and a few manages to hit the <em>Donnaghey</em> but don't penetrate the tough wooden hull. The return broadsides from both sailing ships cripple the modern vessel and kill most of the officers.

The uptimers' modern firepower (even the relatively simple weapons and vehicles from a civilian town) initially make short work of downtime armies. But the wiser heads in town repeatedly caution that it doesn't make them invincible. Their limited supply of weapons and massive numerical disadvantage puts them at risk, the smartest of their enemies quickly develop tactics to neutralize their advantages, and a 17th century cannonball will kill you dead, no matter how well armed you are.
</li><li> In "Who Goes Here" by Bob Shaw, it's played for laughs. The Space Legion is armed with lasers and their enemy only has gunpowder weapons - but the planet has constantly smouldering vegetation (tobacco). Between the smoke from that and the smoke from the cannons, the lasers effective range is only a few feet.

</li><li> Said but not shown on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: the reason energy weapons are used on the station and on starships is that the BiLPro weapons (<strong>Bi</strong>nary <strong>L</strong>iquid <strong>Pro</strong>pellant, firearms with extremely powerful liquid propellant that is partly stored in the round and partly in the gun in the form of two inert liquids) issued to EarthForce infantry for planetside combat are <em>too powerful</em> and have an unfortunate tendency to rupture the weaker sections of the hull and cause collateral damage with the ricochet from hitting the stronger parts of the hull (the ricochet will <em>always</em> happen with more conventional and less powerful firearms), whereas handheld energy weapons don't do either. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> explains that EarthForce is still using BiLPro as small arms for planetside combat as well as for artillery and tank guns, even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">gauss cannons</a> are starting to take over as tank guns.
<ul><li> It's also shown that, in a literal example of this trope, attacking a planet with lasers and particle weapons is acceptable, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">throwing rocks at it</a> is a <em>war crime</em> due the greater devastation and the long-term effects.

This was not a huge liability on Core planets where Alliance troops would have ready access to spare parts, but out in the planets the show was mostly set in, using a laser meant that you'd have a powerful weapon that ran out of ammo quicker, you couldn't carry as much ammo (due to the bulk and weight of the power packs), and when (not if) it broke on you it would be harder and more expensive to repair it.

Europeans use their superior technology just as effectively against Martians as against, say black Africans. Martian terrain does not lend itself to effective guerilla warfare nor do the Europeans have much trouble with Martian diseases the way they are subject to tropical diseases on Earth. It is the cost of transport to Mars and the lack of resources needed for European-style warfare (particularly coal or some other burnable fuel for the steam engines and metal for casings) that is slowing European conquest and colonization.

On one side you could have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> casually using fusion guns and black hole projectors, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Tau</a> whose basic infantry weapon is a plasma-launching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">coilgun</a> assisted by sophisticated electronic targeting systems. But due to the game rules, if those warriors are unfortunate enough to get locked in close combat with a bunch of howling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orks</a> waving around stone clubs, their advanced sci-fi ranged weaponry is exactly as effective as a stick with a nail in it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">if only because the game rules don't actually bother to make a distinction between a stick with a nail in it to, say, a medieval sword</a>).
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Imperium of Man</a> still makes use of firearms. While small arm-sized auto and stub weapons (pistol and rifle equivalents using caseless ammo) are often lackluster, larger guns are just as powerful as their energy equivalents, the bolters remain fast-firing <em>rocket-propelled AP/HE/incendiary grenades</em>, and their artillery (using the powder bag system dating to <em>1917</em>) is one of the most devastating weapons of the game.
</li><li> And compared to the above, Chaos weaponry is downright <em>archaic</em>. The Imperium gets plasma-sheathed swords and fusion guns, while Chaos gets swords forged in hellfire and scythes with blades dipped in the cauldron of Nurgle.

They became <em>more</em> formidable when they weren't dominated by evil wizards or warlords of more powerful races, as they would avoid battle-by-attrition in favor of ingenious traps and ambush-and-retreat positions.

As in sci-fi examples stated further above, megacorps do not bother with failsafes and countermeasures against primitive measures, as they just won't be utilized enough to make the cost worth it. Corps that fear such things may be used to infiltrate them tend to hire mage/tracker(usually a bandersnatch or hellhound) teams to roam their halls and spot anything out of the ordinary. From the sample NPC quotes for a Native American chief:
<div class="indent">"I have a fine horse, so why would I need a car? A horse is a renewable resource. Have you had any success breeding your car lately?"
</div></li><li> In yet another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>-related example, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition">Star Wars: Saga Edition</a></em> RPG has it in the rules that while energy shields will stop any energy weapon, up to and including the ubiquitous lightsaber, a simple slugthrower or sling can penetrate it. And using that ruleset (namely the <em>Scum and Villainy</em> sourcebook) it was possible to develop weapons that could be used to take down shielded enemies in an area larger than a major city, so long as it was clear line of sight to them.
</li><li> There is a Chinese board game that has these aspects with 8 units, the elephant all the way down to the mouse. Simply put, it is a game of 1-8, where the higher number eats any number directly below it. However, the mouse which is the number 1 is the only piece that can eat the number 8 which means that it is the weakest that defeats the strongest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Stratego" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Stratego">Stratego</a> has the same mechanic, where the Spy can defeat the Marshal if it attacks first.
</li><li> Some of the more powerful units in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Heroscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Heroscape">Heroscape</a></em> are Medieval units or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">colonial-times</a> soldiers who are able to destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Soulborgs</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a variety of formats, some with over ten thousand cards available, some with less than two thousand. While Legacy (which contains every card ever printed) is typically considered more powerful than smaller ones they are also specifically designed to beat the metagame they exist in. The result is that decks made for Standard (which has only the most recent cards) can sometimes create present Legacy decks with cards they're incapable of dealing with because the card is unplayable within the Legacy metagame.
</li><li> This happens very occasionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em>. In close quarters jungle fighting a Venusian fighting with a club could easily outmatch an Earthling with a gun, especially considering how wet it is on Venus and the sheer size of the Venusian. Also sometimes something that appears low tech, like a Venusian wooden axe, has unusual properties that give it a huge edge against modern technology.
</li><li> The "technological" armours in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> are fairly good at defending against energy weapons like laser pistols (which normal armour can't block). However, they provide almost no defence against normal (medieval-era) weapons, and the latter do about as much damage as the energy weapons. One wonders why the armour's creators couldn't find a compromise between physical and energy defence when designing their armour...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>, lowly Red-clearance Troubleshooters (just one rank above the dumb masses who work in the food vats) are typically outfitted with lasers and reflec armor (shiny stuff that kinda sorta reflects lasers), while slugthrowers and kevlar are restricted to somewhat higher clearances.
</li><li> Happens sometimes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>. The setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> are thought to be the undisputed kings of the battlefield, but they can be brought down by an infantryman with a satchel charge who is willing to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">Colossus Climb</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">blow up the leg joints</a>, in an anthropomorphic version of the sticky grenade rush sometimes attempted on tanks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2">World War 2</a>. In the expanded universe, Mechs have been brought down by means as simple and expedient as rolling log traps, just like the iconic <em>Star Wars</em> example, and in one instance a Mech was defeated using nothing more than a broom handle, a severed power line, and a very good throwing arm.

Even bullet-using rifles/SMGs and miniguns/chainguns are more effective. (There's usually a powered-up version of the pea-shooting blaster available, though, such as Quake II's Hyperblaster and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a>, or the various upgrades to the dispersion pistol in Unreal.)

<ul><li> In the far future of the 26th century, the massive alien empire known as the Covenant attacks humanity armed with advanced plasma weaponry, energy shields, and power armor. Humanity responds with... basically what they're using today, bar using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">coilguns</a> in the spinal armaments of their spaceships and a few other bits. Several of the small arms calibers the UNSC uses are even no-shit modern models, such as 7.62 M118 NATO. Despite this, humanity holds its own pretty well, mostly being overwhelmed because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">all but the most extreme losses are simply shrugged off by the Covenant</a>. Specific examples:
</li><li> In all cutscenes and novels (and gameplay), the basic human assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns are shown to be <em>very</em> effective against Covenant armor. Even Elites, who are decked out in full powered armor, goes down to single pistol rounds if their energy shields are knocked out (which typically only takes a few rifle or pistol shots anyway). In general, UNSC infantry consistently give as good as they get against the Covenant in ground combat; though it helps that 70-80% of Covenant infantry are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">Grunts and Jackals</a>, who have <em>horrendous</em> morale, bad training, and are usually armed with little more than pistols.
</li><li> Special mention goes to one occasion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFlood">Halo: The Flood</a></em> where a Covenant Wraith, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank">Hover Tank</a> with a plasma mortar as its main armament, gets taken out by a .50 BMG machine gun (the bullets penetrated its lightly-armored rear section). The weapon itself may be futuristic, but the round was invented in 1921!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFallOfReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFallOfReach">Halo: The Fall of Reach</a></em>, a small Covenant warship is crippled by a nuclear missile detonated with a 100-meter proximity fuse, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointDefenseless">point-defense</a> having apparently failed it. That's completely within the range of something that can be created today.
</li><li> The UNSC's Scorpion tanks tend to tear through the Covenant's Wraith tanks (in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">every main game</a> will have a breather sequence where Master Chief goes on a curb-stompy rampage in a Scorpion), despite being titanium-armored and equipped with a mere 90mm smooth-bore. Which, going by both the caliber and velocity, you'd expect to find on a Cold War era tank. It helps that, per <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloOblivion">Halo Oblivion</a></em>, the Wraith's plasma mortar has an effective range of about a kilometer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">easy to believe</a>), whereas typical Cold War era tank guns capped out at multiple kilometers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, you can witness several shielded Covenant light cruisers getting utterly gutted by a combination of 70mm autocannon fire and conventional cruise missiles.
</li><li> On that same note, a nearly kilometer-long frigate in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> also gets destroyed by a salvo of conventional cruise missiles.
<ul><li> The UNSC's main anti-air guns are essentially just <a class="urllink" href="https://www.halopedia.org/M71_Scythe">Vulcan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M61_Vulcan">cannons<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (in-universe characters even refer to them as such as a nickname), down to firing the 20x102mm HEI round. They tear through Covenant gunships/transports (Phantoms) and light fighters (Banshees) easily. They're even used as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.halopedia.org/M85_Scythe">point-defense weapons<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on the <em>Infinity</em>.
</li><li> The Onager at the end of <em>Reach</em> is basically just a scaled up version of the 32 megajoule railgun that the United States Navy is testing, at 33 meters long with a yield of 1,100 megajoules.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107n6c');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note107n6c" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107n6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though, use of DT fusion technology has made it usable with a relatively small generator, whereas a scaled up version of the naval railgun would require a <em>massive</em> one.</span> Yet, if fired at a Covenant battlecruiser's main gun, it will not only completely pierce the armor protecting it, but cause a backfire that destroys the entire ship, as Noble Six proves at the end of the game. Keep in mind that a battlecruiser is <em>over a mile long</em> (which makes the "weak spot" so massive that it's actually larger and easier to hit than a modern supercarrier...).
</li></ul></li><li> Covenant Hunters are multi-ton twelve foot tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> covered in several inches of the same material that the Covenant use for warship armor. A mundane 102mm HEAT rocket is still totally capable of overpenetrating them in both the novels (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFlood">Halo: The Flood</a></em>) and in gameplay. Ditto the 105mm recoilless rifle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaloLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaloLegends">Halo Legends</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> takes this to a literal extreme, where Lucca's prehistoric rock-slinger is more powerful than a laser pistol <em>from the future</em>. When Ayla reaches maximum level, her fist can hit for more damage than any other weapon in the game, including swords, guns, bows, etc.
</li><li> The Battle Walkers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield 2142</a></em> are supposed to be the pinnacle of Infantry Fighting Vehicles. Should an infantryman wander between its legs, however, he can whittle down the hulking machine with little more than a pistol pointed at its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> (though you'd still need a hundred rounds or so to do so). The Walker pilot can further uphold the trope, though, by simply crouching down, beating the infantryman's pistol with a very heavy chunk of metal.
<ul><li> Similarly, the "Active Defense" shielding employed by most of the vehicle lines do not fully repel gunfire. Air vehicles (especially the heavily armed Gunship) are especially prone to AA fire.
</li><li> Ditto on both of these for the Battlezone RTS/FPS genre crossover remake and its sequel, except for the crouching part. However, being filled to the brim with hover tech, ANYTHING can fly given the proper incline to start up its ascent. Unfortunately they can't aim very far downwards, making this more of a sped-up transportation method (skipping slopes and pits in the terrain) than battle tactic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, this is actually justified - while laser weapons do exist, kinetic energy weapons are more effective shot-for-shot. Thus even in the future, we're still using guns that fire bullets; although now that gun has nearly limitless ammo and is capable of freezing you, setting you on fire, punching through your armor, destroying your shields, increase their mass... That said, in close-range ship-to-ship combat, lasers will literally melt enemy warships, since point-defence lasers ignore kinetic barriers. The series zigzags it&mdash;the most technologically advanced weapons are not lasers, but streams of molten metal fired like one. It is absolutely played straight in the third game, however; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonists release a giant Sand Worm to distract the resident technological Eldritch Abomination, and the creature does them one better and manages to kill it. Without assistance. After being hit with one of its weapons nearly point-blank</span>.

Realising that their high-tech weaponry ain't doing smeg against the invaders, the worms decide to arm the "trusty shotgun"... Which can take down UFOs.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> series is notorious for this. Put a tank (attack 8) against a spearman (defense 3) that happened to be left lying around from the early game, make the spearman a fortified (+ 50%) veteran (+ 50%) defending a mountain (+ <em><strong>200%</strong></em>) and presto. Or a missile cruiser against a galleon, or a helicopter against a maceman... games after the first one added multiple combat rounds to help modern units out, which made instances of this trope rare enough to stand out better.
<ul><li> Worse yet, in the original <em>Civilization,</em> a battleship could attack a city guarded with just an ancient phalanx, only to have the phalanx win. Radar doesn't detect wooden rowboats indeed.
</li><li> Archer stack on defense.
</li><li> The developers have actively been trying to fix this problem in the later games, with mixed results. For example, one way is to disallow stacks, forcing each unit to fight on its own (although flanking bonuses have been added to slightly offset this change).
</li><li> Strangely, though, an airstrike against <em>any</em> target, even a primitive spearman, results in some damage to the aircraft. Did the fighter jet fly low enough to be hit by a spear or something?

As the turtle ship is by far the strongest sea unit available to anyone in its era (it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining">trades off</a> the caravel's standard sea exploration for nearly <em>double</em> its attacking power), this is not as difficult as it sounds.

Perhaps the worse example is the transition from the enlightenment era to a late industrial navy. Dreadnoughts have a relatively minor stat increase compared to the Men o' War/Ships of the Line they replace, and are liable to be sunk when engaging more then one, when logically the latter shouldn't be able to <em>scratch</em> the former.

The latter three have late-renaissance armies of musketeers, cannons and cavalry in steel plate armour, while the former two haven't yet invented metalworking or the wheel.

On the one hand, they are mostly armed with Cold War-era weapons and little to no aircraft, but manage to match the much more technologically advanced US and Chinese forces. On the other hand, their individual units are far weaker and less effective compared with their enemy counterparts. The GLA instead wins by combining stealth, economic power, sheer numbers, and dirty tactics to overcome their technological disparity.

Bullet weapons completely overpower energy weapons because they ignore shields. Energy weapons have to deal with a fighter's shields first- and then they do less damage to the actual hull of the shield in average than projectiles. The only "drawback" projectile weapons have is that bullets <em>supposedly</em> slow down when approaching an enemy with shields (with no damage penalties). This doesn't actually happen ingame, and even if it did, chances of hitting the target would still be high, considering you are using either a fast-firing chaingun or a hitscan sniper rifle.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> Dial M For Monkey segment "Huntor", Monkey defeats Huntor by smashing his weapons with rocks and trapping him like a tiger using a hole.
</li><li> Gemma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dogstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dogstar">Dogstar</a></em> is an expert with thrown rocks (as are most of her race). In "Persuasion", she destroys an entire space station with a single, well-thrown rock.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone">Scary Door</a></em> episode (that happens to be a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em>) in the third movie.
<div class="indent"><strong>Narrator:</strong> In the end, it wasn't guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of God's creatures: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Tyrannosaurus Rex</span>.
</div></li><li> Also the page quote that is from a classic monster horror movie that was made on a planet inhabited only by robots. It had the robots as heroes (obviously) and a human as the monster that resisted even their most powerful magnetic pulses, but dies by falling into a stick.
</li><li> In "A Taste of Freedom", the Decapodian Mobile Oppression Palace (a war mech intended to subjugate Earth) gets destroyed by a single 1980s cruise missile that Fry found in a museum. The missile itself ends up requiring a designator (namely, a burning flag) to lock on and hit the Palace because most of it is made of <em>mud</em>.
</li><li> In "Fun on a Bun", the army of Neanderthals along with various beasts manage to handle themselves well<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11de6b');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11de6b" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11de6b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">read: stomped them flat</span> against the modern humans, led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">Zapp Brannigan</a> mind you.
</li><li> DOOP's initial invasion force to the ball planet (Spheron) gets thrashed. The Earthlings have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotoprotoneutronTorpedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotoprotoneutronTorpedo">Poistron Shooters</a>, the ball-like aliens are unarmed and simply bounce on them until they die (okay, they had ONE bomb... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartoonBomb">a 19th century one</a>). It helps that the Earthlings just sit still closely-clustered in the open and take individual potshots at the Spheroid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Occurs often in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em>, where a fountain drink is teleported into the control room of a doomsday weapon, frying the controls, and destroying the weapon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, the combined energy blasts of Mojo Jojo, Princess, and HIM only manage to hold off the girls... until Fuzzy Lumpkins drops a rock, and defeats them.
</li><li> In another episode, when a race of advanced vegetable aliens try to invade the planet, the Powerpuff Girls and the kids of Townsville fend them off by literally <em>eating them</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E7TreehouseOfHorrorII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E7TreehouseOfHorrorII">Treehouse of Horror II</a>", where the primary weapon for the human uprising against their alien overlords is Moe wielding a board with a nail in it. This makes sense considering the aliens invaded when the entire earth was unarmed after Lisa wished for world peace, and had things like slingshots. After being driven off, the aliens muse that one day the humans will "create bigger boards and bigger nails" until one day "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">they will create a board with a nail so big it will destroy them all!</a>"
<div class="indent"><strong>Kang:</strong> Your superior intellect is no match for our puny weapons!
</div></li><li> Parodied again in "The Lastest Gun in the West" when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cowboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cowboy">Buck McCoy</a> stops a robbery by Snake and his gang, armed with assault rifles and riot armor, using only his lasso. Since the robbers' bullets just go straight through the lasso's loop when they try and shoot at it, the robbers exclaim that it's the ultimate weapon.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiralZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiralZone">Spiral Zone</a></em> episode "Back to the Stone Age", the evil Black Widows disable the heroic Zone Riders' equipment during a battle in the Australian outback. The Zone Riders respond by enlisting a friendly tribe of aborigines to train them in using ancient weapons, which they use to defeat the Black Widows.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> B.C. (Before Comedy), in which a caveman's curiosity about a robot activates its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">defense mechanisms</a>. The caveman later responds by throwing large rocks at it; for the rest of the fight, they seem evenly matched.
</li><li> In the episode "The Infinite Vulcan" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em>, a container of knockout gas proves to be very effective in a room with a phaser-disabling field.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E15Trespass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsTheCloneWarsS1E15Trespass">"Trespass"</a>: Territorial natives of Orto Plutonia attack Republic troops that have superior armament. Their attacks are surprisingly effective due to their camouflage and superior knowledge of the terrain.
</li><li> Massively and horrifyingly averted later on. When Grievous and his droid army head to Dathomir, the Nightsisters attempt to fight back using spears, bows, and hand-to-hand skills... against enemies who are made out of metal, are physically stronger than organics, and are wielding guns, bombers, and tanks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">They proceed to get slaughtered with relative ease</a>, except for Ventress who was smart enough to use her lightsabers and force powers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>
<ul><li> In "Go with the Flow", Oona, the little protohuman girl, successfully took down Waspinator with a stick thanks to Cheetor's advice: "When you're battling 'bots, hack at the hinges." Really, Waspinator may have been the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, but he's still an alien war machine.
</li><li> Also, in the series finale "Nemesis", the primitive humans held off Inferno, a flamethrower wielding war machine, and Quickstrike, a poison wielding war machine, with, well, sticks. The two did eventually get their act together, though, mostly because they weren't expecting the assault. They were inspired by Dinobot, who took down Megatron with a stone hammer in "Code of Hero". Although, again, Dinobot is an alien war machine. Subverted moments earlier, when Dinobot attacks Megatron with a stick (no rock yet) and is brutally smacked aside and mocked for thinking it would work.
</li><li> In "Bad Spark", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Rampage's</a> introductory episode, he proved to be unstoppable by conventional weapons. They could only halt his progress by having Silverbolt bury him in a rock slide.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged also in the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers">Ultimate Avengers</a></em> movie. Wakanda's weapons technology is surprisingly effective, but this is solely because they are forged of Vibranium and their few gun-based weapons are powered/controlled from a downed Chitauri ship. When the ship is destroyed, and they have to rely on their medieval-grade tech, they really don't do so well, for all that their weapons are capable of piercing Chitauri armor.
