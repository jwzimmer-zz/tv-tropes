</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>When dealing with media, sometimes it is difficult to overcome the feeling that, however much you may love a TV show, the only reason it exists is to make money. Sure, it might have great writing, acting, animation, but when it comes right down to it, it got produced because someone wearing a fancy suit thought a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">other guys wearing fancy suits could make money off of it</a>. This feeling is even more overbearing when you consider all the TV shows you <em>don't</em> like&mdash;and likewise can only come up with the profit margin being the reason why anyone produced those horrible things.
</p><p>But sometimes, there are shows which transcend the profit motive. It's not necessarily the case that they're good shows, but someone obviously cared a <em>lot</em> about it and put their absolute all in. There are details which, frankly, make no sense for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">genre formula</a>. Why bother having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">a superhero show that has accurate Nazi war equipment</a>? Why write a book set in a fantasy universe with accurate descriptions of Medieval fashion? Why include hours of speech in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conlang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conlang">made-up languages</a>? Why devote hours of expensive CGI work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">to making the twin brothers in a corporate drama look identical</a>? Why, when you know simply from the brand name alone a product is going to make massive moolah, bother working at all, why not just phone it in and take a long nap?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The answer to this is simple. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">Not all of us need money to justify effort</a>. A lot of people are honestly just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Doing It for the Art</a>.
</p><p>This motivation spreads across all genres of known media &mdash; its main hallmarks are when the creator of a work is clearly putting far more effort into the project than necessary. Indeed, sometimes the amount of work being put in is a little creepy. Sure, it's a great vision and all, but does anybody need <em>that</em> much detail? It should be noted that this only really makes sense when applied to pop culture. The definition of this is that a work is better than one could reasonably expect, whereas one expects commitment and seriousness from culture such as literary fiction or art cinema, defined by being done for its own sweet sake, that is never expected or intended to make money. Saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce">Joyce</a> went to more trouble than he needed to in the composition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ulysses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ulysses">Ulysses</a></em>, for example, is missing the point of that kind of endeavor.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This often applies to niche media, since oftentimes with more popular works the creators must work with the general expectation that they need to create something better than sliced bread. Yet it also crops up more obviously in media where we generally have a set of diminished expectations&mdash;want to know why the Western Animation section is so huge? Because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> makes the really good ones stand out more.
</p><p>Now consider that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a>. Doing It for the Art does <em>not</em> equal quality work. If it did, then this page would have been put in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SugarWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SugarWiki">Sugar Wiki</a> a <em>long</em> time ago. Some examples here are of people who genuinely tried, but just weren't talented enough &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">Sturgeon's Law</a> still applies, regardless of the creator's motives. (In which case this would be some kind of consolation, as in, "That movie sucked, but at least they cared") Conversely, doing it for money does <em>not</em> equal lack of quality. Indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnumOpusDissonance">some writers' hackwork is preferred to what they regarded as important stuff</a>, sometimes because doing it for money was the only way they let down their pretensions. Also, if somebody lets their success get to their head to the point where their "vision" hurts the quality of their work, it can quickly slide into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a> situation. However, the romantic ideal represented by this motivation can lead to a backlash against creators who are perceived to be doing something solely (or even partially) for reward, possibly by people who assume that doing something for money means you don't put your effort into it for artistic reasons as well.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film">film</a> analysis, someone who does a lot of this is called an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuteurLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuteurLicense">auteur</a></em>, as opposed to the <em>metteur en scene</em>, who is the journeyman director who makes someone else's movie. Within the artists' circle, this practice is called "Art for art's sake". Of course, if it does actually make money, well that's just a perk.
</p><p>The same motive appears in a far less benign (and more explosive) form in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>.

All of the effects in the logo probably could've been achieved with CGI, but instead, Liberty Studios&mdash;the company behind the logo&mdash;went all out with making it using practical effects. The entire city landscape was an actual model that was 10 feet wide and 30 feet long, with so much stunning attention to detail that it took over three months to fully construct, and during the making, smoke was pumped through in order to give it the appearance of a three-dimensional environment. The music that scores the opener was produced with a 65-piece orchestra. The HBO logo was made with brass, and the laser effects were achieved with light and camera tricks. Other than some superimposition effects for the family at the beginning as well as the ending title cards, practically no computer effects were used to create the opening. No wonder it's such a favorite of many!

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu "God of Manga" Tezuka</a> continually revised his work (and removed stories from circulation that he felt weren't up to par), created experimental works just for the hell of it, and is even said to have died saying "Please, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>, let me work!" Tezuka, in fact, had a license to practice medicine (which would've guaranteed financial security) but turned it down because he wanted to draw comics instead. Realize that when he did this, <em>there was no manga industry,</em> so Tezuka was turning down a guaranteed career (as a doctor) in favor of something that could've just as easily crashed and burned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> creator Akira Toriyama. Though he hated the weekly format of the manga, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and being obligated to make his work a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">Franchise Zombie</a>, his works never declined in quality&mdash;in fact, it became even more complex and interesting&mdash;and he always took special care about making sure no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">plot holes</a> were created. What's also notable is that he had already become very financially successful with his previous work <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump">Dr. Slump</a></em>, and yet he chose to keep going with another work.
</li><li> The music of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, rather than going for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic">J-Pop</a> music that's the norm for such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a>, elected to go for classic jazz performed by composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno">Yoko Kanno</a> and her band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSeatbelts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSeatbelts">The Seatbelts</a>. If you really want to be impressed, consider the fact that Jazz is not a popular art form in Japan (though Tokyo does currently have a fast-growing jazz scene, well worth checking out).

You do not get much more committed to a work than when your director <em>dies</em> partway through, causing a series that could really be wrapped up in just three months to drag on for three <em>years</em> and keep going at it and refusing to let any of that lessen the quality.

</li><li> Anime dubbing, in general, tends to be like this. Ask any voice actor in a convention.

Then, on audition day you go there and take your shot in person).

<ul><li> And if this <a class="urllink" href="http://hetalia.livejournal.com/12282701.html">recent Q&amp;A blog post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is anything to go by, he's also notably open in letting his fans have their way with his work, including scanlations.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoichiMashimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoichiMashimo">Koichi Mashimo</a> founded his own studio, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeeTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeeTrain">Bee Train</a>, just for this. After a lengthy hospital stay from a skiing accident, he formed his own company to nurture the creative talent of its staff and not be driven just for profit.
</li><li> Animation-wise, the <em>entire</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> genre is this, compared with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a> in the U.S. and Canada: while in the former countries, traditional animation is a dying breed and CGI animation is becoming more and more common, Japanese animators are notorious for sticking to their guns and still using traditional animation. There's a few Japanese CGI films and series, but most of the time they're experimental works and never intended for being used for replacing traditional animation as a whole.
<ul><li> In Japan, CGI animation is normally restricted for animating non-living stuff, like vehicles, ships, robots, etc. And sometimes, some animation studios like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunrise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sunrise">Sunrise</a> are notorious for <em>never using</em> CGI in some series, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>, when the titular machines are always being traditionally animated and never being rendered in CGI, with some few exceptions.
</li><li> On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioNue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioNue">Studio Nue</a> (the owners of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> franchise) are notorious for using CGI for many of their later series, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisOfAquarion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisOfAquarion">Genesis of Aquarion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol">Aquarion Evol</a></em>, but only for the robots.
</li><li> Yet other studios <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, by going full CGI but <em>making</em> it look hand-drawn. It's easy and cheap to entirely use CGI that clearly looks computer-rendered, and often not of good quality, but when Japanese studios do it, there is a strong tendency to mimic the hand-drawn look that makes anime so unique (which is <em>not</em> easy). An example would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel">Arpeggio of Blue Steel</a></em>, which is entirely done with CGI, but apart from the unusual fluidity of movements looks as hand-drawn as other works, just a little cleaner.
</li><li> That's not to say studios don't embrace what 3DCG has to offer. Take for example Sanzigen Animation; right down to the studio name,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wxuh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0wxuh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wxuh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sanzigen = San Jigen (Third Dimension)</span> they're committed to making series in fully rendered 3D, with video game cutscene quality.
</li><li> Making a CG show look hand-drawn is sort of standard for anime, but bringing characters into fully 3D space takes arguably a lot more effort. <em>Stand by me Doraemon</em>, the only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> film to use a 3D style, goes above and beyond to look almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar-like</a> in quality and attention to detail, in addition to having a plot that tugs at any <em>Doraemon</em> fan's heartstrings. It all paid off, becoming the highest-grossing film of the franchise to date (and for a franchise as popular as <em>Doraemon</em> in its home country, that says a lot).
</li><li> The season 2 opener for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em> has the brothers try out different animation genres and techniques to figure out the best way to become a "proper" series. Jyushimatsu is the only one to come back rendered in CG&mdash; but rather than make a cheap model and barely animate it, the team uses film quality, high framerate, expertly rendered, smooth CG to make his gag work. And they didn't even cel shade him to match style! Did they have to put that much in for a 1-minute gag? No, but if he had to exhibit the technique as "proper", they needed to make it live up to the title.

As a result of this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun">Steel Ball Run</a></em> is widely considered the best-written and most engaging storyline in the entire franchise.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> anime is done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Madhouse">Madhouse</a> on what is reportedly a very average budget...and yet they are creating amazingly detailed and beautifully animated scenes for the show, far above what that budget should be able to allow. All indications are that they're doing it simply because they love the concept of <em>One-Punch Man</em> and just want to bring it to life in anime form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedLine">Red Line</a></em>: It took seven years of hand-drawn animation to make this movie.

</li><li> Similar to the examples above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> contains a sprawling universe adorned with myriad details and complicated histories, economics, and ecology. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert">Frank Herbert</a> loved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">show his work</a>.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> writers do this.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books. Before the first book came out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K.

And for much of this time, she was an unemployed single mother living on welfare. She turned down various offers for the movie rights and only relented when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> agreed to her conditions, which included following her storyline and averting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBrit">Fake Brit</a> trope. And like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a>, she has been quoted as saying she didn't actually have children in mind when she wrote the series and was really just entertaining herself.
<ul><li> The success of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> franchise has made her rich enough to never have to write another book in her life...not that that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCasualVacancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCasualVacancy">stopping</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCuckoosCalling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCuckoosCalling">her</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CormacMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CormacMcCarthy">Cormac McCarthy</a> certainly seems to take this view towards his career. Though he has always been critically acclaimed, his audience has expanded significantly since he started out, growing from just a few thousand readers to <em>millions</em> of them&mdash;but in spite of this, he claims that he'd be just as happy if he'd stayed relatively unknown and that getting the chance to write is its own reward.

It took even longer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenErikson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenErikson">Steven Erikson</a> to even find a publisher who was willing to take the entire series as planned because it was such a massive undertaking and he wasn't willing to compromise.

<ul><li> It went so far that he let Warner Brothers give him a percent of the net rather than the gross. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting">Hollywood Accounting</a> at it's best, he's not upset despite the 'billion dollars' it's made for WB with him seeing almost nothing off DVD sales.
</li><li> With season 3, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">became the first person in the history of American TV to write a full-length season single-handed</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">And then did it again with season 4</a>.

<ul><li> Which turned out to not only have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>, since the actress playing Talia Winters got written off the show when she felt her character wasn't getting enough airtime.
</li></ul></li><li> JMS put so much thought into how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Starfuries</a> would work (placement of thrusters for maximum maneuverability, the pilot stands to lower his center of gravity, et cetera) that JPL, who were big fans of the show, asked if they could use his basic design to build vehicles for construction in space. JMS said they could, on the condition that they're called Starfuries.
</li><li> He had the storyline so thoroughly plotted out ahead of time that he refused to let actors ad-lib their lines, for fear it might cause discontinuity, or wreck a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> was originally created because writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss">Mark Gatiss</a> were gigantic fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and frequently discussed what a modern adaptation of the books would be like. They did not expect it to become popular and actually had a very small promoting budget during the first series.
</li><li> When Andrew Robinson was cast as Garak in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, he actually wrote a detailed back-story for his character, and presented his "character bible" to the series' producers. Apart from some elements that went counter to the previously-written Cardassian history, the producers approved Robinson's efforts, which became part of Garak's character. Many of his notes which didn't make the series proper, went into the Expanded Universe novel "A Stitch in Time".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekEnterpriseS03E08Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekEnterpriseS03E08Twilight">Twilight</a>" features a 'blink-and-you'll-miss-it' opening scene of the Earth being blown up. Originally it was simply going to be the Earth blowing up like planets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, one minute it's there, next minute, fireball. The effects supervisors just weren't happy with that and so they came in on their days off and re-did it to the final product. Now, you actually see the oceans boil and fault lines actually crack, as if the Earth spontaneously combusts into dust. When asked who authorized the extra work and why, they said they did it for free. Just because.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages">Damages</a></em> apparently have this as their motive for existing. Neither were major successes with the public, and both are unapologetic in the extreme for what they are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DayBreak2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DayBreak2006">Day Break (2006)</a></em> seemed to have been this. Unusual for a TV show, the entire season was written out and filmed as a whole like a movie and then broken up into 13 episodes, allowing for a great deal of continuity and tricks that might have otherwise been difficult or even impossible to do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> always had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a> and company going that extra mile for the series, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryBelafonte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryBelafonte">Harry Belafonte</a> episode really counts; Belafonte insisted on an especially meaningful closing number and Henson was game. The end result is the number, "Turn The World Around," which features specially-built Muppets based on actual tribal masks. It's a profoundly moving, spiritual performance that Henson always felt was the finest of the series. In fact, Henson liked the song so much that when he passed away in 1990, his family requested that Belafonte perform the song again at Henson's funeral.
</li><li> Patrick McGoohan was, at one point, the highest-paid star on TV. That he turned down both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSaint">The Saint</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> and the millions he might have earned for another series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan">Danger Man</a></em> in order to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em> speaks volumes. He also made sure that he supervised every element of the show, often rewriting and reshooting segments (when he wasn't the credited writer or director that is), all in order to make a highly personal statement about the nature of freedom.
</li><li> Most producers and writers, and even actors on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">the show as their lifelong dream</a>, but special mention has to go out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>, who tried for sixteen years to get it back on the air. Say what you want about his storytelling, but he really loved the show.
<ul><li> This trope even extended to actors who weren&#146;t even fans of the series before appearing in it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a> took to the series like a fish took to water, going to the extra effort of labelling many of the dozens of levers on the TARDIS console so he knew which one to use for a specific purpose and had great faith in the future of the show, which couldn&#146;t be said for the other shows he previously appeared in. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a> enjoyed doing the show because he finally got to have the chance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeDearBoy">to play a suave action hero</a> rather than another comic character, also developing friendships with the other cast members and crew, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> thought the entire idea behind the show was cool and was more interesting than his own personal life.
</li><li> Not forgetting all the other people who worked on bringing Doctor Who back after its hiatus and those who work on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Doctor Who Expanded Universe</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasBriggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NicholasBriggs">Nicholas Briggs</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a></em>. It helped keep <em>Doctor Who</em> alive before its return.
</li><li> The Doctor Who Restoration Team, the people responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster">remastering</a> on the later VHS releases and all the Classic Series DVD releases work for free so that people can see the show in the best possible quality.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisMorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisMorris">Chris Morris</a> is known for the lengths he will go to to achieve his effects and his sheer guts and bravery (even memorably mocking drug dealers to their faces). His agent has commented that she doesn't tell Chris what his fee will be for any one programme...because he's likely to negotiate it away to pay for extra filming.
</li><li> <em>Frank Herbert's Children of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> has the song "Inama Nushif", which is sung entirely in the Fremen language.
<div class="indent"><em>"Unreal. Brian [Tyler] actually <strong>searched through Herbert's books and deciphered enough of the fictional Fremen language</strong> to write this powerful song. A song that drives my favorite moment of the film."</em>&mdash;<a class="urllink" href="http://www.briantyler.com/Site/Children_of_Dune.html">Director Greg Yaitanes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</div></li><li> The lead actors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency">Emergency!</a></em>, Randy Mantooth and Kevin Tighe, went through the paramedic training of the Los Angeles County Fire Department at the time in order to accurately portray their roles. Had they not skipped the final exam, they would've been fully-certified paramedics.
</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em> contestants have had a tendency to do whatever they wanted artistically, even if they risked losing. Austin, Stella, and Sandhya really stand out in this category, and even more moved into it at least once for a challenge with a weird inspiration or one where they had immunity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle">Dave Chappelle</a></em> walked away from a $50 million contract to continue <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em> because of the changes that would come with the money. He instead preferred to do impromptu stand-up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NigelHawthorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NigelHawthorne">Nigel Hawthorne</a>, who played Sir Humphrey, was required to perform some of the most convoluted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness">Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness</a> ever brought to screen, big or small. However, in spite of being forced to perform lines like: "The relationship, which I might tentatively venture to aver has been not without some degree of reciprocal utility, and perhaps even occasional gratification, is emerging a point of irreversible bifurcation and, to be brief, is in the propinquity of its ultimate regrettable termination.", he never once resorted to using a cue card, but insisted on actually learning his lines. The writers were shocked and awed.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace">Rupauls Drag Race</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake">UK</a></em> was noted by many fans to have a much less tense atmosphere than the original American series. This is because the UK show airs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>, which forbids game shows from giving cash prizes. The winner's only prize is a trip to Los Angeles to film a spin-off webseries similar to <em>Alyssa's Secret</em>. Since not as much was on stake, the queens were able to just enjoy each other's company and showcase their talent on TV rather the fights and cutthroat attitudes that have come to define the US version.

Developer Naughty Dog had a habit of perfectionism and only hiring the best, most driven people to make their games as good as could be, which meant they'd be willing to put up with twelve-hour-plus workdays and coming in sick to work on the game. They were never asked to work overtime week after week until they were hospitalized because they'd do it anyway. Some employees found it impossible to do it for the art in the extreme crunch, to the point that most game animators refuse to work with Naughty Dog at all.
<div class="indent"><strong>Schreier</strong>: Many who have worked at Naughty Dog over the years describe it as a duality -&#151; as a place that can be simultaneously the best and the worst workplace in the world. Working at Naughty Dog means designing beloved, critically acclaimed games alongside artists and engineers who are considered some of the greatest in their fields. But for many of those same people, it also means working 12-hour days (or longer) and even weekends when the studio is in crunch mode, sacrificing their health, relationships, and personal lives at the altar of the game.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> was still able to make beautifully drawn cartoons, thanks to Ed Benedict's brilliant character designs and colorful backgrounds despite a low budget.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>. He turned down the offer he got from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation">DreamWorks Animation</a> to pitch a movie, due to the ridiculous way they treated him and attempted to manipulate his ideas. He was also so insistent on keeping the original content of his cartoons in, he purposefully slowed down production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> so the censors would have less time to go over them. It worked but ultimately got him fired. (Needless to say, the Spumco staff is generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a> &#151; after John K was kicked out, the majority of the crew left alongside him). The unbelievably high quality of Spumco productions (with John K's rule to never draw the same expression twice) is not unheard of either &#151; especially that all of it is done for TV. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2006/03/beautiful-people-9-yeesh-and-spumcos.html">as evidenced by this blog post of John K's<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it's also quite evident the economic thinking is not absent.
</li><li> Every shot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> has detail unheard of even for anime. Thus, only 4 seasons have been produced in 9 years.
</li><li> The same can be said for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, though the detail isn't nearly the same. What also deserves mentioning is that while most shows have a significant staff of writers, <em>every episode but one</em> was written by creator Jackson Publick and/or Doc Hammer.
<ul><li> Another example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>; Publick and Hammer, during the long hiatus between seasons one and two had worked out exactly how to open the show, seeing as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both Hank and Dean were dead</span>. A montage, set to the song "Everybody's Free" by Aquagen and Rozalla. The problem was, to license it would cost a seventh of the budget&mdash;not for that episode, the <em>entire second season.</em> To which the creators said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt">Worth It</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a> team has always had high expectations of themselves, but they really outdid themselves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>. They animated nearly every single hero and villain in the DC Universe, most of whom are not well known and very few of whom even have lines. But the lengths they did to are even better illustrated in the episode "The Savage Time", where for no reason whatsoever, they have very accurately drawn Tiger Tanks. How many people watching the show are even going to notice the tanks? How many can even tell that they actually did the research? <em>They</em> can, and apparently, that's all that mattered.
<ul><li> It wasn't just the Tigers in "The Savage Time"; though the detail's not great, the soldiers Jon Stewart is with are carrying appropriate weapons (M1 Garand, Thompson SMG, M1918 BAR), and Savage's car in the movie is similarly under-detailed, but unmistakably a closed-top Mercedes-Benz 700k. The German soldiers carry MP40s at one point. The fire rate for weapons are off, certainly, and no one reloads, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> factors into that. Plus, they put some effort into it; I mean, how many people pay attention to a <em>freaking staff car?</em>
</li><li> To emphasize how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">edgy and dark</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> is, the animators painted on black paper instead of white paper. The result? A truly atmospheric show that threatened to put the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a> in the naughty corner.
</li></ul></li><li> While outside of the DCAU, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em> demonstrates the same attention to detail as the DCAU producers, writers, and animators. Every single episode is jam-packed with references big and small to the DCU's history either in the form of characters who vanished after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> (or in at least one case, only appeared in a single issue!) or storylines or even panels. An episode featuring the first full appearance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is chock full of these, referencing everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superdickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superdickery">Superdickery</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a> films to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>. It's this clear love of the character and the DCU that has made a show that could have been a disaster into a show that is widely adored by comic fans.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, the creators flew all over the world to find inspiration and art references for architecture and landscaping, studied martial arts in order to create realistic combat sequences, and hired someone with a PhD so that all the Classical Chinese ideographs seen in the series would be accurate. They also hired consultants for these things.
<ul><li> The background posters that Sokka walked past one episode were seen for less than ten seconds, yet they still included a realistic poster for a theatre company (foreshadowing for another episode) and a poster for a town meeting about air quality (referencing the industrialized Fire Nation) and all the gambling being done on the streets. All in archaic Chinese.
</li><li> Constellations that are seen in the sky of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheWaterbendingMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheWaterbendingMaster">"The Waterbending Master"</a> are the same as those seen a season later on a star map in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheDesert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheDesert">"The Desert"</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> had a lot of risk involved with their project. They predated the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> CGI revolution by a full year. It was an untested medium and the equipment to do it was not cheap. On top of that all the voice-acting, writing, directing and music was done in the same studio, instead of being farmed out to different companies like most shows. The results were a really tight story with great voice acting and animation that was groundbreaking.
</li><li> The artists who worked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyOrbots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyOrbots">Mighty Orbots</a></em>, produced in the 1980s, actually studied classical and Japanese animation in order to be the best they could be. Notable mainly because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a>. When you could get away with stuff like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChallengeOfTheGoBots">GoBots</a></em>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears1980s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears1980s">The Care Bears</a></em>, studying classic film for inspiration is, well, a little <em>weird</em>.
</li><li> As seen by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a>' quote on the quote page, the animators at the "Termite Terrace" studio producing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> shorts for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> between the mid-1930s and 1946. Helping the anarchistic spirit along were a succession of humorless bosses that more or less invited open rebellion. Founder Schlessinger won unwitting immortality as the inspiration for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a>'s trademark lisp ("You're dethpicable!"). The Warner Bros. themselves really didn't know or care what was going on in their animation unit, leaving hands-on oversight to bean counter Eddie Selzer. Recounting the genesis of the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BullyForBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BullyForBugs">"Bully For Bugs"</a>, Jones recalled the day Selzer showed up at his door as he and writer Mike Maltese were hashing out story ideas and bellowed: "I don't want any pictures about bullfights! Bullfights aren't funny!" Then Selzer marched off, leaving his dumbfounded staff staring at each other. "Well," Maltese said, "Eddie's never been right yet..."
<ul><li> Jones explained that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc">What's Opera, Doc?</a></em> took several months longer to make than their usual cartoons (it featured a hundred-odd separate scene cuts) and his staff fudged their paycheck records, billing the extra time onto quickly-made cartoons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ObanStarRacers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ObanStarRacers">&#332;ban Star-Racers</a></em> came about solely because Savin Yeatman-Eiffel wanted to make it. Deciding working for another company would not give him the creative control he needed, he founded his independent own animation studio, spent years raising funds and years more perfecting the animation in cooperation with Japanese studios. Yeatman-Eiffel worked hard to secure the best talent available (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno">Yoko Kanno</a> and Taku Iwasaki for the soundtrack, and French sound engineer Jerome Wiciak for sound effects&mdash;a dozen tracks were created simply for the Whizzing Arrow's engine noises), wrote the scripts for all 26 episodes <em>in several languages</em> and worked personally with the voice actors, and years were spent polishing the show to a mirror shine. The result is a children's series of extremely high quality, combining a story of exceptional depth and consistency with excellent characterization, a great soundtrack, and consistently breathtaking animation.
</li><li> Although it is easy (and not unusual) to simply dismiss any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> product as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a>, some works, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, are well-liked for their appreciation of the mythos and written with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> in mind. And there's the live-action movie above for a different implementation of this trope.
<ul><li> <em>Transformers</em> has so many incentives to suck&mdash;it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">for small children</a>, and about robots that transform into cars. But sometimes, just sometimes, it's funny and engaging and a bit meaningful, and there's no other reason than that the creators, against all odds, care about what they do. Sometimes.

One of the animators working on "Shadow of the Condor" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> airplane buff, and the Fokker Dr.1 and Spad are gorgeously drawn.

While they certainly got the squash-and-stretch elements down, the humor left a great deal to be desired.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, most cartoons were 30-minute toy ads, and it was virtually unthinkable to go about it otherwise. Robert Mandell deliberately misfiled the memo and blew out as many stops as he could afford. Broadway actors as his voice talent, a truckload of Del Ray sci-fi authors as writers, Toyko Movie Shinsa doing the animation, arena rock bands for the soundtrack, some of the <em>earliest</em> attempts to weld CGI and cel animation...and throwing the lot into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWestern">Space Western</a> that looks like the bastard offspring of a time-traveling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>. The end result is a one-season wonder called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Galaxy Rangers</a></em>.
</li><li> Musical numbers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> contain elaborate instrumentation and rhymes, as well as a handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonuses</a> that only make sense to one well-versed in musical terminology. For instance, how many eight-year-olds are going to recognize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> at the end of "BBBFF"?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>'s animation drawing up until the last season was hand-inked and hand-painted, and even then, Danny Antonucci and his staff would always try to give it that hand-drawn look. Not to mention Mr. Antonucci had a hand in writing and directing nearly every episode, and he and his crew have managed to come up with all kinds of different stories and gags with such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast">Minimalist Cast</a>. And the crew would always tell the kind of stories they wanted to tell and ended it the way they wanted to.
</li><li> The team of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> went to insane lengths to make the show as realistic as possible. Greg Weisman keeps up an ongoing blog to close up every possible plot hole (and every question, if it does not ask for spoilers, will be answered), and has done so for <em>15 years now</em>. The foreign language is accurate, the historical people are accurate, the magic is consistent, the gargoyles have (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodScience">by the standards of Hollywood</a>) a believable biology rather than just being magic, and every single character is complex to unbelievable levels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em>. The amount of work put into this series really shows how much the crew cared about it, even just observing from the surface. But when you start noticing and then paying attention to such trivial things like posters on the walls of clone barracks or clubs, the elaborate details on spaceships, bugs crawling around on branches, <em>garbage</em> thrown away on the lower streets of Coruscant, and dozens of other tiny-little background details the creators have sneaked in - despite the fact that most viewers probably wouldn't register any of it on the first time viewing - it becomes mind-blowing! Then consider that all of this is made in CGI, with a relatively low-budget when the series was only starting. And when their budget and technological assets increased as the series progressed, they did even more with it.
<ul><li> Going even further, they had assets to use from Lucasfilm's archives. For instance, during the production of Season 3 episode "Wookiee Hunt", the crew had a meeting with Peter Mayhew to make sure they got Chewbacca's appearance (while working within the art style), characterization and body language accurately.

</li><li> The Pantheon, a temple, and later church, in Rome. The dome, aside from being a <em>perfect</em> hemisphere with a diameter of 43.3m (142 feet), implies an imaginary, second hemisphere, the pole of which touches the floor <em>exactly</em>. Given the size of this space, a considerable margin of error would have been considered acceptable, but the architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, wanted it to be <em>perfect</em>. And this in 126 AD.
<ul><li> The art critic and historian Robert Hughes notes in his book <em>Rome</em> that the Pantheon would never be built today: no one would insure it, no one would even propose it, because no one would think that you could make something like that safely out of poured concrete. And they'd be dead wrong: Thanks to a unique and brilliant design, the Pantheon has stood for nearly nineteen hundred years, and shows no signs of collapse.

When asked about that, Gaudi replied: "Well, of course, these are for the angels to see." Now, there's a man who did it for the art. And Gaudi is not the only one doing it for the art when it comes to the Sagrada Familia. Gaudi started working on the church in 1883. It is currently about 50% complete. It has been largely funded by voluntary donations. It will, hopefully, be finished in 2026&mdash;in time for the centennial of Gaudi's death.
</li><li> Creators of Gothic churches would also care to create statues that were perfect on all sides&mdash;even if no humans would ever see the backsides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> still would. One gothic Cathedral, Chartres (whose architect is unknown and is regarded as a collaboration by pious villagers), is invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FForFake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FForFake">F for Fake</a></em> as an ideal of this belief, noting that it rendered hollow most artistic pursuits as vain and self-fulfilling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">his own works included</a>. During Baroque, this approach changed.
</li><li> Averted by many early great masters of Western art, who did most of their work, now hanging in major museums, for commission. Though even then, they hardly phoned it in. Michelangelo was initially not enthused about the Sistine Chapel commission and if he had done a simple ceiling fresco, he could have gone to his more fulfilling work in sculpture; instead, he decided to go overboard.

The restaurant is one of many 3-story buildings, no more than 20 feet wide, in an ordinary neighborhood, just opposite a tire shop with fake palm trees. Inside, there is only room for 30 people, and no more than two people can sit at a table. There are no waiters or staff, beyond the chefs themselves, who are dressed in casual clothes and talk casually to the customers. There are no decorations, there is no wine selection, and metal and hip-hop music plays in the background. Most days, the owner Michael Carlson barely breaks even. This is because <em>every single cent the restaurant makes goes into making the most innovative and creative food anywhere in the entire US.</em> No expansions, no remodeling, no fancy facades or gold-plated silverware. The man even served a party of 20 of the greatest chefs in the world <em>on the house</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">His passion drove him to exhaustion and a premature exit</a>, but he reopened Schwa a year later, and kept on going.

When he lost his battle with lymphoma, all of his remaining unsold paintings were treated likewise.
</li><li> Bill Cunningham (1929-2016) was a fashion photographer who made it his personal mission to be as independent a voice as possible and made a point of seeking out people on the street who showed a strong sense of personal style, no matter how quirky, rather than celebrities following the latest trends. He lived an ascetic life and spent many decades living in a tiny studio (without a kitchen or bathroom) at Carnegie Hall that was filled to the brim with fashion books and boxes of photographs and negatives while sleeping on a board balanced precariously on top of it all. For most of his life, he would only work freelance for publications that offered him editorial freedom and would often work for free because his employers would have nothing to hold over his head in the event of a disagreement. He was so firm in his belief that he would never be beholden to anyone that he wouldn't even accept water when he was out photographing events. This philosophy, combined with a sharp eye, meant that he was highly respected within the fashion community and well-known fashionistas like Anna Wintour lived in fear of his ignoring them on the street because it meant that they were falling out of style. As he got older, however, he compromised somewhat by taking a job with the <em>New York Times</em> as he realized that he needed health insurance and a pension towards the end of his life.
</li><li> Ingeborg Refling Hagen (1895-1989) <em>lived</em> this trope, and even more awesome, taught a number of people to do it with her. Being a hardass on the philosophy of "free art" as a concept, she, and a bunch of dedicated students, managed to work for free, to produce difficult and rather long stage plays, lasting up to 10 hours (or the better of a day). The audience came from miles around to watch this <em>for free</em>, and the actors, some of whom were on stage for almost the entire time, earned nothing besides the experience. This theatre made history more than once. The motto was :"The theatre on behalf of the poet - the poet on behalf of the people". For the art indeed.
<p></p></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> has become rather well-known for making several controversial decisions all in the name of art. For example, when he was accused of plagiarizing a script for the film he wrote, he plagiarized his apology, <em>then</em> plagiarized his apology for that. He wore a paper bag on his head to a film premiere reading "I'm Not Famous Anymore," and set himself up at an art exhibit where he allowed patrons to do anything they wanted to him. Most recently, he has appeared in an artful music video for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sia">Sia</a>'s song, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWZGAExj-es">Elastic Heart<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, filmed himself <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHVMNjP0QA">performing multiple monologues<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that a class of English college students wrote, and hosted a stream where he re-watched every film he ever starred in, face cam included.
</li><li> The Disney Imagineers put excruciating amounts of detail into the designs of rides, gift shops, and just the ambient scenery at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">the theme parks</a> (at least much as they can achieve with the budgets they are given). Many of the "authentic-looking" props in period-specific areas like Frontierland and Main Street, USA are actually authentic antiques, not replicas. "No one will ever see it" is not considered a good enough excuse to skimp. The policy is to create something that Walt Disney would approve of, and he was such a stickler that he would rather indefinitely postpone the opening of an attraction than let it open before it was perfect.

The most notable case occurred with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>&mdash;after the DVD boxsets were discontinued by Rhino many years before, fans assumed it was time to go back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">tape circulating</a>, only to find out that Shout had secured the rights to the whole series and would be releasing them all in vanilla and collector's edition sets. Among other shows, they've saved <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV">SCTV</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParkerLewisCantLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParkerLewisCantLose">Parker Lewis Can't Lose</a></em>, many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> series, many classic animated series from the 80's and 90's, and scores of cult television shows from the last 30 years. They genuinely love their jobs and work as hardcore fans who just happen to have a DVD publishing company.
<ul><li> Just one example of how far Shout! Factory is willing to go: for years, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> fans assumed the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera">Gamera</a></em> episodes would never be officially released. After all, one of the Rhino DVD sets had to be yanked and re-released with a different episode due to copyright issues with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> film and the owners of the <em>Gamera</em> rights were even less pleased with Best Brains. And then Shout put <em>all the Gamera episodes out on one collection</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WKRPInCincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></em> is another prime example. After TV reruns and 20th Century Fox's season 1 DVD release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">scoured the episodes</a> of nearly all the licensed music integral to the show &mdash; the latter seeing low sales because of this &mdash; Shout! came to the rescue and put out all the episodes with approximately 85 percent of the original soundtrack.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek Media</a> has licensed many older anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">that may have otherwise never seen the light of day.</a> Among many other things, they also managed to find the TMS dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em>, which was thought to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">lost</a>, and include it on the Blu-Ray release of the series.
</li><li> Charles Lauzirika is a sci-fi fanboy who was put in charge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a>'s DVD production team and has created some of the most well-known DVD sets and film documentaries of all time. Notably, during the production of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a> Anthology</em>, he not only fought to get the uncut version of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien3">Alien&sup3;</a></em> documentary "Wreckage And Rage" released (which required an epic amount of wrangling with Fox executives for close to a decade), but he also went back to the "workprint" edition of the film that was constructed for the <em>Alien Quadrilogy</em> release in 2003, assembled every member of the supporting cast whose voices couldn't be picked up on the temp track, and had them re-record all of their lines. He also served as the producer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a>: The Final Cut</em>, in which he brought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a>'s son in to replicate his father's dialogue for voiceovers that were hard to hear, and had Joanna Cassidy reshoot her famous run through the glass windows so continuity errors from the original film could be corrected.
</li><li> The revived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> has basically no budget, which meant they couldn't get Sally Timms as SARA or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCullen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCullen">Peter Cullen</a> doing the promos. So why is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum">Steve Blum</a> back as TOM, despite taking an extreme pay cut? Because he <em>really</em>, <em><strong>really</strong></em> wanted to be. In fact, he led the charge for its return when the April Fools' broadcast revitalized the fanbase. Working for slave wages is not an issue for him.
<ul><li> The entire crew working on Toonami are doing this entirely out of love for the block. The block is maintained by a mere <em>six people</em> and <a class="urllink" href="http://toonami.tumblr.com/post/35306537174/wow-6-people-you-guys-must-be-on-crunch-a-lot">none of them are getting paid extra to work on it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> This is also the only reason Steve Blum still dubs anime, which pays nothing compared to voicing video games and Western cartoons.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"It doesn't pay the bills, you can't survive off of it; but I love working in that environment, I love the people that I'm working with in that environment, I love the passion that people have for anime and I love the fans."</em>
</div></li><li> The reason why video releases for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCriterionCollection">The Criterion Collection</a> command premium prices is because each film's restoration and/or transfer is supervised by some of the best film engineers in the industry, and it allows for the company to produce carefully-curated sets for prestige films. Compared to "barebones" video release, each Criterion edition often includes a full-color booklet that features essays or remarks from the director discussing the historical or cultural significance of their work, long-form video documentaries that are often praised by fans for their thoroughness, and (for older films) featurettes focusing on the restoration techniques used to bring said films up to the highest digital quality.

<ul><li> Kuronuma Ryuzo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em> does this. His in-story nickname is <em>Ogre General</em> because of his strict, uncompromising perfectionism. He's perfectly willing to spend five years to try and put on the perfect play if that's what it takes. The financing guys are not particularly appreciative.
<ul><li> Most of the major characters fit this. Maya never actually seems to even think about the pay when considering a role, and only ever seems to have money when someone else is managing her finances.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pok&eacute;mon Adventures</a></em>, White, the president of a Pok&eacute;mon talent agency, always makes sure that her Pok&eacute;mon actors get the best possible treatment and that her clients are satisfied even if it means she fails to make a profit and has to camp outside in a tent. However, she is shown to be worried about her finances.
</li><li> Rohan Kishibe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em> went on record to state that the only reason he works as a mangaka is because he wants people to read his work, not because of the fame or money it could bring; writing manga that other people can enjoy is all that matters to him.

Although he enjoys performing in large venues in front of thousands of people, he honestly doesn't care about riches or fame, and in fact, seems perplexed as to why some of his fellow band members do. As far as he's concerned, it's all about the music; everything else is of negligible importance.

Midori Asakusa and Tsubame Mizusaki both share a strong passion for animation, and found the Motion Picture Club with friend Sayaka Kanamori in order to let them make the kind of material they want. However, their very same passion becomes an obstacle multiple times along the way, with Mizusaki's emphasis on highly detailed character animation bogging down the pace at which she can work, to the point where she spends two weeks working on a single cut at one point, and Asakusa's inability to accept the idea of outsourcing labor (due to her own difficulties at socializing and a perceived inability to properly convey the ideas she envisions) forcing her to undertake far more work than necessary. However, thanks to Kanamori being around to keep the two in check while still making provisions for their own wishes, Asakusa and Mizusaki are able to get their projects actually finished (albeit at the last minute) while still having room for the kind of artistic expression they strive for.

When she becomes Princess Luna's Court Musician, her joy comes not primarily from the wealth and fame the position brings, but from the fact that there is no audience in the world with more experience of classical music and more ability to understand and appreciate her work and from the fact that as Luna's Court Musician she has the time and resources to learn fields of music she would never otherwise even have heard of.
<ul><li> In <em>The Court Musician Of Equestria</em>, Octavia is contrasted with Thrash Metail.

He did have a less-skilled friend work as a front man and bring him the good ones though. Unfortunately, this ends up backfiring because when the nobleman who hired him to make the sword started quibbling over the price, Domingo calls him a fool for haggling over a piece of art, which Domingo worked himself nearly to death on.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, Clayface cites this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> claiming that standing in for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> was "the role of a lifetime".</span>
</li><li> Garrett in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> treats his thievery like this. Sure, it pays the bills, but the <em>real</em> reason he steals is pride. In <em>The Metal Age</em>, he needs to break into the Bank and gleefully mentions he's always wanted to do this ("Now I <em>know</em> I'm a master thief, breaking into the Bank Vault..."). Then in <em>Deadly Shadows</em>, he notes that he's been dying for a good excuse to break into the museum ever since they declared their security to be thief-proof.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Roommates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Roommates">Roommates</a></em>, Rakesh's main motivation for doing pretty much <em>anything</em> is that he thought it would make good art. He says that he follows nature's example: nature doesn't ask you if you like its flowers, or expect you to pay it anything in return; it merely blooms because it feels like it.
</li><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Logs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock 1</a></em> is from Bill McDonagh, a plumber hired for the construction of Rapture. After being paid to use cheaper tin pipe fittings instead of brass, he went ahead and ordered brass anyway and planned to pay the difference on grounds of professional pride: "Profit or not, no man bails water out o' privies built by Bill McDonagh."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">The Elder Scrolls Online</a></em>, the House of Reveries is a theater troupe in Summerset that's all about this trope: while most artists in Summerset are hoping for fame, the members of the House of Reveries give up their identity, donning a mask and a new nickname (such as "Alchemy", "Feathermoth", "Clever", etc). It's to the point that if the face of one of their members is seen, that person is kicked out of the troupe.

Team GrisGris was pretty much four people making a horror game with the RPG Maker 98. The game had loads of characters, notes and multiple endings, leading to it gaining so much popularity that it not only got a remake by the now much larger team, full with voice actors and all, it also spawned an anime, a manga series and multiple pre- and sequels.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LastWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LastWindow">Last Window</a></em> was being developed while Cing was facing bankruptcy. While the game was being translated for an EU release, Cing <em>did</em> file for bankruptcy. The game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel">arguably even better</a> than the first

What's even more staggering is the project was birthed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>, yet the subject matter is handled with much more care, respect and dignity than many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> cares to afford.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SpiritHunterNG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SpiritHunterNG">Spirit Hunter: NG</a></em>, this is Natsumi's reasoning for running The Black Rabbit; her actual profession is a horror author, but the bar was left to her by her husband, so she keeps it running as a hobby to satisfy their loyal customers, rather than to make a profit.
