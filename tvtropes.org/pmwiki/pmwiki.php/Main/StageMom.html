And they'll do anything they can to make that happen, up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector">interfering in the kids' work</a>. They'll do this even at the risk of derailing the production, straining their relationship with their kids, or even endangering their kids outright. Sometimes this helps their kids start successful careers, but more likely, it'll actively hurt the kids' chances when they <em>lose</em> gigs because the directors don't want to deal with the parents. And failure usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">turns out badly for the kid</a>.
</p><p>A Stage Mom is similar in theme to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mama</a>, but whereas Education Mama usually just wants what's best for her child, the Stage Mom is driven by pure narcissism. She's a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a>, persecuting other people's children and being incredibly pushy with her own. It's clear that she has self-serving reasons for pushing her kids into show business, wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicariouslyAmbitious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VicariouslyAmbitious">vicariously experience the fame and fortune</a> she dreamed of herself. Sometimes she may be a failed actress or musician and this is the next best thing. The worst cases overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSvengali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSvengali">The Svengali</a>, exploiting their children for their own gain.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The family's financial status greatly plays a part in how the Stage Mom behaves. If the family is poor, she might be pushing her child to have a better life than she had, or less altruistically, she sees their talent as a cash cow to milk for all it's worth. Extra points if the kid's performing career is the family's most stable source of income. If the family is wealthy, the mom might want to project the image that her little darling is perfect in every way. And if she's a successful performer herself, she might be grooming her child in her own image&mdash;whether the kid wants it or not&mdash;because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteDwarfStarlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteDwarfStarlet">her own time in the spotlight is up</a>.
</p><p>If she has other children that aren't performers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">don't ask about her relationship with them</a>.
</p><p>If the child is an adult who had a more conventional rise to fame, the Stage Mom could still reappear later in life. This usually happens when she realizes that she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoattailRidingRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoattailRidingRelative">manipulate her kid's fame for her own gain</a>. Bonus points if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">the parent wasn't involved in the kid's life growing up</a> but is <em>now</em> interested in a relationship. Most likely, the kid winds up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">telling her off for her behavior</a>, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome">realizes the error of her ways</a>, and the plot is resolved before the episode ends.

This is because pursuing the performing arts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillyElliotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillyElliotPlot">is not seen as very masculine</a>. In fiction, the male version is almost always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SportsDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SportsDad">Sports Dad</a> (as opposed to a "Stage Dad") who pushes his children into becoming star athletes and gets more worked up during games than the kids actually playing. This variation is particularly focused on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender">living vicariously through his kids and trying to make up for his own failed ambitions</a>.

</li><li> Haruka Harukaze, Doremi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> mother and an ex-pianist, who lost her career due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a>, almost became a Stage Mom. When little Doremi showed some degree of musical talent, she tried to shape her into a good pianist, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Doremi panicked on stage</a>, and Haruka didn't insist. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">She felt so guilty about it</a> that when Doremi's little sister Poppu wanted her mom to teach her how to play, it took both her <em>and</em> Doremi's efforts to convince her.

<ul><li> Grace tries to push her daughter Serena into Rhyhorn racing, even though she hates it. She decides instead to become a Pok&eacute;mon performer, which causes no end of fighting between the two. Grace eventually relented, though, and let her pursue her dreams.
</li><li> Tammi the cheerleader, from the Johto league, took this attitude out on her own Pok&eacute;mon; she became bitchy and demanding to them and furiously berated them for any mistakes. It took a brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> and a harsh call-out from Misty to get her to stop doing this.

While he does want his son to grow as a player, he realizes that constantly playing one-on-ones with him wouldn't give him any room for growth even though it meant he was already a natural when joining the Sannoh basketball team, so even though he suggests to the team's coach that Eiji go to the USA to get a more varied playing experience, it ends up being just a suggestion, as he knows Eiji loves the sport and wants him to evolve at his own pace.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher">Speed Grapher</a></em>'s first episode, a young would-be ballerina and her stage mom visit the ballet dancer Kazuya Shirogane in his camerino so the girl can show off her dancing skills and become his pupil. Shirogane turns out to be an Euphoric, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">and ends up breaking the girl's arm</a> while screaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadnessMantra">"Not flexible!

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHOLiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHOLiC">xxxHOLiC</a></em>, Kohane Tsuyuri's mother pushes her to appear on television specials.

It led to some of her issues.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, Bonnie Jones, mother of Cissie Jones-King (<em>aka</em> Arrowette), is a superhero stage mother, pushing her daughter into becoming a superhero because of her own frustrated ambitions. She seems to care more about fame than her daughter's own safety, and she's been called out for this many times by other heroes:
<ul><li> Cissie's first appearance was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Impulse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Impulse">Impulse</a></em>, where her superhero Mentor Max Mercury was so disgusted by her mother that he called Child Services.

</li><li> Wonder Girl's mother was particularly disgusted with Arrowette's costume, which Bonnie seemed to have picked out to be more flashy than functional and wasn't good at protecting her from injury. (Bonnie didn't take it well and started a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">Cat Fight</a>). Arrowette's costume change to something more sensible (well, at least relative to what she wore before) seems to imply that Bonnie has backed off a little bit.
</li><li> Cissie herself quit the superhero game out of frustration. Undeterred, Bonnie quickly found a new vocation for her: competitive archery. Cissie qualified for the US Olympic team and eventually won gold, which only got her mother to start scheduling public appearances for her.

It parallels a scene from <em>Gypsy</em> that also happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, where Rose made June cry by telling her that their dog died.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">Star Trek IV</a></em>, Sulu (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei">George Takei</a>) was meant to have a chance encounter, while walking around 20th-century San Francisco, with a kid who would turn out to be his ancestor. Unfortunately, the kid who was to play the part had what Shatner described (in <em>Star Trek Movie Memories</em>) as "the most over-the-top stage mom" he had ever encountered, and she ended up making her kid so stressed out that she made it effectively impossible to actually film the scenes.

Macaulay was pushed into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodSon">The Good Son</a></em> because Kit repeatedly threatened to withdraw him from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone2LostInNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone2LostInNewYork">Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</a>.</em> The first director of <em>The Good Son</em> ended up quitting the project to avoid Kit's meddling. Eventually, other movie studios began turning Macaulay Culkin down for potentially suitable roles <em>specifically</em> because they did not want to deal with his father. After working on multiple films with no break and then facing the consequences of having a pushy manager, Macaulay retired from acting at the age of fourteen and has since stayed out of the spotlight. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone</a></em> producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColumbus">Chris Columbus</a> found Kit Culkin so difficult that, when casting for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies, took great care to hire child actors only if their parents were clearly <em>not</em> pushy.

According to Barry Norman's book <em>The Hollywood Greats</em>, Judy's mother would punish her by locking her in the closet. And she later suggested that studio officials do the same if she was acting up. Her father was something of an aversion, as Judy often appealed to him when her mother was getting unbearable (when he died, Judy was quoted as saying "now there's no one on my side").
</li><li> Dina and Michael Lohan, parents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, are exemplars of the self-serving side of this trope.

Then, she pushed her younger daughter Ali to enter showbiz as well, causing many people to fear that Ali would end up with the same issues as Lindsay. Michael, meanwhile, blabs about Lindsay to the media every chance he gets and went on <em>Celebrity Rehab</em> for seemingly no reason other than to get attention and talk about her.

It showcased everything wrong with the trope: mother being pushy and forcing her kid to talk to total strangers, kid doing it only because her mother told her to, mother interested in her kid performing in something that's very much not for kids (to the point that in most sketches, child characters are played by kneeling adults).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewBarrymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrewBarrymore">Drew Barrymore</a>'s mother Jaid could be blamed in large part for her daughter's drug and alcohol problems at such a young age. Jaid regularly took young Drew to such adult hangouts like Studio 54 and the China Club. Years later, sometime after Drew posed for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em>, Jaid decided that she wanted to pose nude too!

Specifically they demanded Hilary be paid a fee of $500,000 that she was told she'd get if the movie grossed over $50 million. Lest you think this was Disney being unreasonable, they were offering Hilary $4 million to star in a second film - of which she would also get 25% of the profits. Her mother insisted the $500,000 also be paid out of the principle of the thing, so the offer was withdrawn completely.
</li><li> More than one similar accusation has been leveled at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyRayCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyRayCyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>' father and co-star) in regards to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> franchise. Billy Ray says it's the other way round: the executives were the ones abusing and restraining Miley.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThoraBirch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ThoraBirch">Thora Birch</a>'s father Jack Birch, a former porn star, has meddled in his daughter's affairs enough that he's caused a hit to her reputation. He reportedly showed up on set during production of the 2007 film <em>Horrified</em> and watched over his daughter while she performed a simulated sex scene with Dean Winters, then in 2010 he reportedly stayed in her dressing room at a stage adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> and tried to micromanage the production. This ended up getting her fired from the play. Thora was also fired from a biopic about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily">Manson Family</a> girls, and the director specifically blamed her father's interference. Equally distressing, Thora doesn't appear fazed by her dad's behavior, nor is she upset that he has cost her work. After she was fired from <em>Dracula,</em> she said, "My dad is my support, and he is the best support that I ever could have."

Willow, their daughter, would later reveal in an interview that she was cutting herself and that Jada was previously not aware of it. Willow also took time off from touring because she "just wanted to be twelve again".

Because it was aired during a time-slot that was considered "child-friendly", ABC's Standards and Practices demanded that the show include more children. This, of course, brought a large influx of pushy stage moms, "all of whom ought to be locked up," according to executive producer Gary Larsen.
</li><li> Chrisoula Workman, mother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArielWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArielWinter">Ariel Winter</a>, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">a bad enough stage mom</a> that the state revoked her custody over Ariel and put her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">under the care of her adult sister</a>, the also actress Shanelle Gray.

She also didn't seem that bothered by Brooke's nude scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyBaby">Pretty Baby</a></em>, which were done when Brooke was <em>twelve</em>.

A full segment was devoted to talking about the stage moms (and one stage dad); though not all were as horrible as the trope described, some were, and usually her daughter would not continue acting because of it.
</li><li> Averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaraWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaraWilson">Mara Wilson</a>'s parents, who reminded her that her education was more important than being in movies. As a result, she is remarkably more level-headed than other child stars, and even wrote <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/7-reasons-child-stars-go-crazy-an-insiders-perspective/">an entire article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> about the crash-and-burn of child stars. She recalls working on a shoot with a child actor who was financially supporting his entire family through performing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> wanted to avoid this trope when casting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub">The Mickey Mouse Club</a></em>. He looked around mostly for amateur kids of a certain degree of talent rather than professional actors, and he kept the mothers (who according to labor laws had to be around) offset by setting up a room where they could relax, chat, knit, or read.
</li><li> Corey Feldman's parents forced him to act at age 3; they'd often lock him in his room to make him recite lines and songs until he memorized them. He was also the sole breadwinner of the family for a while and they'd tell him if he didn't get a gig they wouldn't eat that night. His mother would force him to take diet pills and dye his hair and his father would only really connect with him when they got high together, and they also never told him that they loved him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaylorMomsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaylorMomsen">Taylor Momsen</a> said she was pushed into modeling and acting when she was only two years old. As such, she got burnt out by the time she was 17, and quit altogether - while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> was still airing. She has focused exclusively on her music in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyReckless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyReckless">The Pretty Reckless</a> since then.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2559-tales-from-hollywood-child-wrangler.html">Cracked.com interviewed a "child wrangler"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (basically the person who keeps an eye on the children on sets) and she revealed that the majority of parents will go out of their way to avert this. One woman even carried around a copy of Natalie Wood's biography to remind her what not to become. But that isn't to say that stage parents don't really exist anymore. The child wrangler has a specific story of one woman who caused her child to choke by pressuring her too much and later yelled at her to get the line right or else they'll be back in poverty. The nicest thing said about the mom was that she took her daughter being dropped from the part much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">graciously than expected,</a> instead of throwing a tantrum like other stage parents.
</li><li> Peruvian model and TV presenter M&oacute;nica Santa Mar&iacute;a is a tragic example of that. Her father didn't want her to become a model, but her mother pushed her daughter into modelling at age seven. Later, at age 17, she became one of the presenters of children's show <em>Nubeluz</em>, which was not only popular in her native country but also in Hispanic America <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bw71');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2bw71" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bw71');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and was also seen in the U.S. on Telemundo</span>, but left the show in March 1993, only to return six months later. She had a type of bipolar disorder that led her to commit suicide at the tender age of 21.
</li><li> Gary Coleman was a pretty sad example. In addition to his adoptive parents having him work long hours on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiffrentStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiffrentStrokes">Diff'rent Strokes</a></em> even beyond the child labor law limits and through his persistent illness due to his failing kidneys, they also misappropriated his earnings from the show, which resulted in him suing them and severing ties with them for the remainder of his life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeightonMeester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeightonMeester">Leighton Meester</a> started acting at a young age and found herself financially supporting herself and her mother Constance through modelling gigs (she was ten at this point). Even after Leighton made it big by starring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, she continued to financially support her mother. At one point she was sending $7500 a month under the belief the money was for her brother - only to discover Constance spending it on things like cosmetic surgery (bear in mind the money was supposed to go towards her brother's medical care after he'd had <em>brain surgery</em>) . When Leighton finally cut her off (at the age of twenty-five no less), Constance attempted to sue her for violating an "oral contract" that her daughter had to pay her $10,000 a month. Unsurprisingly, the judge ruled in Leighton's favour. Constance then attempted to sue her daughter for an alleged assault that happened during an argument, but dropped it pretty soon. In true Stage Mom fashion, she claimed that the 10,000 was for "sacrificing her own happiness" in order to facilitate Leighton's acting in their early days.
</li><li> It's a common practice in the acting and modelling industries for some agencies to offer "open days", which are basically turning up to pay a fee to be on the agency's books for a year - and these are often frequented by stage parents eager to get their children into show business. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome">FYI - an agency should never charge a client to be on the books, as the agreement is always to take a percentage of the fee from a job the agent secures.</a> That doesn't stop scam artists from trying, and stage parents who are unlikely to do the research are the most susceptible to it.

After their divorce, she more or less fell apart, going through several stints at a drug rehab facility, going party hopping for days at a time, shaving her own head, blowing through a truly insane amount of money on impulse buying and bad business ventures, and adopting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">fake British accent</a>. It got to the point where she lost custody of her two children and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility, eventually being placed in a conservatorship with her father and attorney being given control of her finances and other life decisions. She recovered over time and recovered much of her former fame, but has never again reached her stratospheric heights, which is probably for the best. Her sister Jamie Lynn was not nearly as omnipresent, but had starring roles in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat">All That</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101">Zoey 101</a>, the latter of which was Nickelodeon's flagship teen drama series until she became pregnant at 16, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">killing the show</a> in its tracks.

Jessica's ex-husband Nick Lachey has strongly implied that her dad's meddling was a major factor in the breakdown of their marriage.
</li><li> Joe Jackson, patriarch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive">The Jackson 5</a>, really, really didn't want his kids to become criminals on the streets of Gary, Indiana. He probably could have found a better way to do this, though, than forcing them into performing. His children have said they suffered hours upon hours of incessant rehearsals after school and on weekends, would be physically abused if they made mistakes, and were strongly discouraged from showing any interest in activities or hobbies removed from the family business.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>, one of the youngest (and by far the most talented), had it particularly hard. He indicated that he basically never <em>had</em> a childhood because he spent all of it performing, and that this was a big factor in his turning his home into a private amusement park once he became a big star and had enough money to do so. The view of a grown man with such success spending huge sums recapturing a lost childhood was seen as a harmless eccentricity by some and as something suspect or unseemly by others, both views which would color opinions of him for decades for the rest of his life. Even after he made it big as a singles star, Joe still insisted on having some say in Michael's career and hinted that he would do the same to Michael's children. Even after Michael's untimely death, Joe did an interview days afterwards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">pitch a record label project</a> he was involved with, with his words of condolence being colored as the Jackson family losing it's biggest star rather than a father having lost his son.
</li><li> Averting this trope was key to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson">Janet Jackson</a>'s success. Like her brothers, she was initially managed by Joe, but her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">first two albums flopped</a> because the public had written her off as just another Jackson riding Michael's coattails (and not even the first girl). Because she was 18 when her second album came out, she was free to control her career as she wished, so she fired Joe as her manager and hired a new one through her record label. He introduced her to the production duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, best known for their work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>. They required that she move to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwinCities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwinCities">Minneapolis</a> during the production of her third album <em>specifically</em> to keep Joe out of the creative process.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheShaggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheShaggs">The Shaggs</a>, a band comprised of three sisters, came into existence because their father believed a prophecy that they would form a popular music group.

</li><li> Pop girl group Destinee &amp; Paris' mother is like this. The main reason they became Destinee &amp; Paris was that their mother suffocated the previous members of their rock band (Ariel and then Sarah, who lasted less than half a year as the Clique Girlz) and they were forced into it after all the bad publicity. (Ariel went on to name her next band NMD &mdash; No More Drama &mdash; as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>) When the two were featured on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/E" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/E">E!</a>! reality show <em>The Dance Scene</em>, their mother continuously told everyone around them that they weren't ready to perform on the night of the performance despite Laurieann Gibson (choreographer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>) saying they were great.

For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> and his sister, Maria Anna, toured Europe as little kids playing piano and violin, under the tutelage of their father Leopold, a well-known composer in his own right. There are also darker examples, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LudwigVanBeethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>'s father, who was so obsessed with his son becoming the next Mozart that he beat him if he didn't practice enough. But overall, the "child prodigy" notion has become so ubiquitous in classical music circles that fans are often surprised to find out that some of the greatest composers &mdash; such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannesBrahms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannesBrahms">Johannes Brahms</a> &mdash; didn't start writing music until middle age, and even the so-called "child prodigies", including both Mozart and Beethoven, didn't really hit their stride until at least their late teens.
</li><li> If you were a prepubescent boy in 17th-century Italy, and you showed promise to be a great singer, your parents might have had you undergo a... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">procedure</a></em> to turn you into a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrato">castrato soprano<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ot0p');"><sup>translation&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ot0p" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ot0p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's Italian for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">exactly what it sounds like.</a></span> If successful, there was a chance that you could become incredibly wealthy and famous, and had famous opera composers start composing arias specifically for <em>you</em>.

This happens even if there are no expectations for stardom from the parents; it's just that since practically <em>everybody</em> who has a shot at stardom in this field started playing when they were that young, anybody who started later is at a disadvantage. Then some parents try to do the same thing with wind instruments or opera singing, where it <em>isn't</em> a good idea to start so young because those fields pose physical risks <a class="urllink" href="http://operagasm.com/about-those-child-opera-singers-heres-the-deal/">that could hurt one's chances at an adult career<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Cohan's father is a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">positive example</a>. Cohan, his mother, and his sister were all brought into the act, and encouraged every step of the way; Cohan spoke of how encouraging it was to see his father in the crowd cheering him on for his entire life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackstreetBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BackstreetBoys">Nick</a> and Aaron Carter's parents' behavior wound up having <a class="urllink" href="http://omg.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/inside-aaron-carter-bankruptcy-wound-worth-just-8-201552078.html">disastrous consequences for Aaron<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> later in his life. At the height of Aaron's career, they blew through his earnings, leaving him saddled with tremendous debt before he turned 18. He cut all business ties to them when he found out what they were doing. Between that and his drug problems, Aaron eventually had to file for bankruptcy in 2013, at the age of 25. Their mother had also attempted to launch a singing career for their sister Leslie, but that went nowhere.
</li><li> It's suspected that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a>'s estranged father Mathew Knowles was a huge stage dad during the early stages of her career with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild">Destiny's Child</a>. His apparent determination to make his daughter a star had fractured the family until they managed to get a record deal, and while he was an effective manager, his abrasive personality made him unpopular with industry folks and fans. Beyonc&eacute; has gone on record that when she turned 18 and started having more of a say in her career, her relationship with her father became more tenuous. His personal and financial problems are rumored to be the real reason why Destiny's Child broke up, and she cryptically mentioned in an interview with Oprah about "needing to let him go" after severing their professional relationship.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> is an aversion. His own experiences with the music industry, both with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> and as a solo act, made him understandably reluctant to let his son, Zak Starkey, follow in his footsteps. It was actually Zak's godfather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">Keith Moon</a>, who bought him his first drum set and encouraged him to become a drummer.

As her career began to flourish and while she still was close to her mother, Davis had much more of a say in everything she did.
</li><li> Filipino singer Sarah Geronimo is a product of a national singing contest, and she simply wanted to use her talents to raise her family from poverty, starting her career at just the tender age of 14. However, her mommy Divine meddled too much into her affairs, holding her finances hostage just to get the other children a better life and even pressuring her not to have a relationship with another man. This constant meddling culminated in February 2020, with Sarah (then 31 years of age) marrying her long-time boyfriend, actor and former car racer Matteo Guidicelli, keeping their ceremony a secret from her intrusive mom. But the lid blew over, as the so-called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">"Divine Intervention"</a> caused a minor scuffle, dragging even a bodyguard hired by Sarah's family (whom Matteo allegedly punched) into the mess that eventually made national headlines.

Her mother paid a fee to a record label <em>ARK Music Factory</em> in exchange to have the song written and produced (which was their bread and butter throughout the 2000s and 2010s) when Rebecca was only twelve. Rebecca in fact didn't want to sing the song and only picked it because the other option was a love song she didn't feel comfortable singing at the age of twelve. She and her mother were however united in suing <em>ARK</em> over copyright for the song.

<ul><li> Lewis Hamilton's dad and ex-manager Anthony was a total stage dad. Lewis eventually had to fire him, and they're no longer on speaking terms.
</li><li> Max Verstappen's father Jos was himself an F1 driver (best remembered not for his driving so much as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">caught fire once</a>) who really wanted Max to be a racing driver. He started his son racing when he was just four years old, was a harsh disciplinarian, has a record of assault (and a restraining order against him from Max's mother), and forced Max to debut professionally at age 17 (which, by the way, is too young to legally drive <em>any</em> car in several countries, including the country he races for). Max couldn't finish that first race because of a blown engine (so through no fault of his own), but the cameras caught Jos' visible disgust.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Hockey player</a> Eric Lindros had stage parents who made a big impact on his career. Lindros was widely expected to be the next great superstar when he was a teenager, and he was set to be drafted first overall by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">NHL's</a> Quebec Nordiques in 1991. Neither of his parents wanted him to play for the Nordiques, partly because Quebec City was small, provincial, French-speaking, and unlikely to market him properly (and partly because the Nordiques were a tire-fire of an organization that was perpetually broke and rumored to want to leave Quebec themselves). The Nordiques drafted Lindros despite declaring (at his parents' behest) that he wouldn't sign. He refused to play for them and held out for a year before the Nordiques were able to trade him to the Philadelphia Flyers. This got Lindros' career off on the wrong foot and made him an early pariah with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> reputation. Lindros did go on to become a very good player for the Flyers, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">his career (and that of his little brother) was cut short by injuries</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jhxd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3jhxd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jhxd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Nordiques, for their part, did exactly what Lindros' parents predicted would happen and moved to Denver to become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995. But in their first season in Denver, with the help of the haul they got in exchange for Lindros three years earlier, they won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StanleyCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StanleyCup">Stanley Cup</a>.

<ul><li> Australian/Serbian player Jelena Dokic's father/coach Damir was notorious for his aggressive and abusive courtside behaviour when she began playing in major tournaments. He also moved his family back from Australia to Serbia after accusing Australian tennis officials of match-fixing. She eventually managed to break away from him, sacking him as her coach and moving back to and competing for Australia.
</li><li> Mary Pierce's father/coach Jim admitted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">training her</a> when she was a child by repeatedly serving balls with his full strength at her face, notoriously screamed "kill the bitch!" at her from the audience during a match when she was twelve, and was on the receiving end of a restraining order from her in 1993, after which he got stabbed by her bodyguard.
</li><li> Bernard Tomic's father/coach John was banned from the ATP tour after he assaulted his son's hitting partner Thomas Drouet. He has reportedly been verbally and physically abusive to his own son for a long time; Drouet said that he once saw him punch Bernard in the mouth during practice.

He then tried to mold both his sons into sports stars in his place, through a strict diet and training regimen and years of verbal and emotional abuse. His elder son Billy eventually just walked away, leaving his father to focus on younger son Lance, who was eight at the time. Over the years, Bill became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">increasingly controlling, abusive, and crazy towards Lance</a>, dictating his life, recording his matches, giving him steroids, and eventually beating him daily. His wife sometimes tried to intervene, only to be cowed into submission herself. The final straw for both was Lance's relationship with a girl named Kim; for Bill, it was the specter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender">his own downfall</a>, and for Lance, it was his father becoming downright obsessive with ending the relationship and keeping it ended. Eventually, on December 27, 1995, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">Lance snapped</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">shot him dead</a>. Tellingly, at Lance's murder trial, the crowd booed the <em>prosecution</em>, who could not find a single person who would testify that Bill Butterfield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">didn&#146;t deserve to die</a>. The defense, meanwhile, fielded dozens of character witnesses for Lance, including Bill's own sister and father, with the latter writing a sworn affidavit that Lance shouldn't be prosecuted. In the end, after a mistrial, Lance Butterfield pleaded guilty to manslaughter and served two years in prison.
</li><li> Marv Marinovich, father of former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> player Todd Marinovich, tried to engineer Todd <em>from birth</em> to be the perfect quarterback. In high school and college, Todd earned the nickname "Robo QB", because he was like a machine. Nobody else had his training and diet regimen, so there was no one who could compete with him. That changed when he got to the NFL, where he was an infamous bust. Todd never especially <em>liked</em> football; he just couldn't tell his obsessed father he wanted to do something else. Once he got to the NFL, with no one to tell him what to do, he spent more of his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">getting stoned</a> than maintaining his "Robo QB" talent.
</li><li> In 2017, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/circuit-court/dropped-footballer-loses-claim-over-post-traumatic-stress-1.3063341">an Irish teenager sued his former football club<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for allegedly causing him post-traumatic stress disorder by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">dropping him from the under-15 team</a>. The boy's father was the team's former coach, and behind the scenes, he complained to the club's board and even unsuccessfully attempted to bring a vote of no confidence in the team's current coach. Unsurprisingly, the judge ruled in the club's favour, and he saw exactly what was going on, explicitly telling the boy's father to distance himself from his son's sporting career.
</li><li> LaVar Ball quickly made a name for himself as a basketball dad, promoting his three sons as future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">NBA</a> stars as soon as they were teenagers. He also has his own athletic apparel brand and unashamedly uses his sons to promote it in a feeble attempt to go up against the big names like Nike and Adidas. His oldest son Lonzo was a genuinely talented college player who was drafted second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2017 (good thing, too, because LaVar insisted Lonzo would only play for the Lakers), but some basketball fans are actively rooting for Lonzo to become a bust and for the Lakers to implode just to get LaVar off their TVs and out of the picture. Among other things, Lonzo turned down a multi-million dollar shoe endorsement deal with Nike and signed up with his father's company, a huge financial gamble that would likely only benefit LaVar if anybody, and a move many saw as forced on him by LaVar.
</li><li> Roy Jones Jr.'s father was an abusive man who was driven to mould his son into becoming a successful professional boxer, forcing him to fight grown men at the age of 8, train ridiculously hard at a young age, and encourage him into getting into cockfighting. Jones has gone on record saying that he isn't afraid of any punishment he takes in the ring because what his dad used to do to him was worse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> by former NFL quarterback Archie Manning. Despite knowing the ins and outs of making it to the NFL (having played himself) and having three sons (Cooper, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton</a>, and Eli) with huge potential, he had almost no involvement in his sons' football careers. When the boys reached high school age, Archie and his wife sent them to a prep school in New Orleans with rigorous academic standards and a poor football program because he felt school was more important. Even after the kids became hot college recruits, Archie didn't force them to attend his alma mater Ole Miss and let them choose their schools (though Cooper and Eli picked Ole Miss anyway). Though the college coaches invited him to sit in on games and meetings and discuss offensive strategies, Archie declined and sat in the stands on game day as a regular fan. In the end, Peyton and Eli became NFL quarterbacks with Hall of Fame-worthy careers that surpass their father's, while Cooper may have made it as a wide receiver had it not been for a severe spinal condition that forced him to retire in college (he had to settle for being an extremely successful investment banker and TV sports broadcaster instead).

</li><li> In any show about child pageants, all the moms and more than one dad shown will be like this, more often than not to sickening degrees. The show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToddlersAndTiaras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToddlersAndTiaras">Toddlers &amp; Tiaras</a></em> is almost entirely dedicated to showing them off. Some of these pageant moms' exploits:
<ul><li> One particularly sickening example is the story of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/consumerhealth/news/article_1639085.php/Plastic-Surgeon-slams-Pageant-Mom-8-year-old-getting-Botox-story-repugnant">Kerry Campbell<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who gave her eight-year-old daughter <em>Botox injections</em>. When she was found out, she not only defended this practice (claiming it was never too early get your child cosmetic surgery to "get rid of the lines") but also claimed that <em>other</em> pageant moms practiced this as well. The fact that the story turned out to be fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTysonZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTysonZone">did nothing to dispel it</a>.
</li><li> One 5-year-old girl named Carley developed an alter-ego called Darla to cope with her mom's pushing her to win beauty pageants. In other words, the mother's abuse led to her daughter developing <em>dissociative identity disorder</em>.

One such parent was compared unfavorably to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Cronos</a>, the Titan famous for <em>eating</em> his children when they were born.

Unfortunately, his career was run into the ground in less than a year, in no small part due to his obnoxious and extremely demanding mother, who was largely responsible for Simon Cowell's company ditching Sampson after they became sick of her. Sampson made a rebound, however, after starring in the 2010 <em>Street Dance</em>.
</li><li> Rose Hovick, mother of burlesque star Gypsy Rose Lee and actress June Havoc, became legendary for this trope following Gypsy's 1957 autobiography and the subsequent musical adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy">Gypsy</a></em> as mentioned above.

It's commonly believed that she forced her daughters into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a> stardom and modeling careers as a means of living out her own dreams of fortune and celebrity.

</li><li> Downplayed with the Knight family - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> dynasty in Norwich, England.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> never had any interest in becoming a wrestler and only trained at their school for fun. She only had her first match because someone else dropped out on the night of a show - and she was picked to replace her. Since then Saraya Knight confessed to knowing that fans find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty">her daughter attractive</a> and marketed plenty of posters and merchandise to sell. Paige recounts a story of being in a car accident one evening and her father still making her wrestle later. Paige did later develop a passion for wrestling in her own right, and making it to WWE was entirely her decision. However, she had to retire at only twenty-five thanks to injuries catching up with her - and starting training at such a young age was thought to be a contributing factor ESPECIALLY when the stories about her parents being abusive trainers went public.
</li><li> Her older sister was a straighter example, pushed into wrestling from a young age and nearly got sent to Japan to train when she was only twelve.
