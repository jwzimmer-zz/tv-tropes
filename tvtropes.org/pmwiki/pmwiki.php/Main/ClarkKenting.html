<ul><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em>. Homura's mouth cover would be moderately effective to hide his identity from people he only meets in the middle of battle once or twice, can&#146;t really get a close look at him and have little or no chance to encounter him in his Kagari persona. He&#146;s nevertheless absolutely <em>baffled</em> by the fact that Tsukiumi and Musubi, both of whom he lives with and have seen him very close-up in and out of disguise, can&#146;t seem to figure it out. Musubi briefly wonders if she has seen Homura somewhere else, but being&#133; well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">a moron</a>, she dismisses the thought because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">"Kagari doesn&#146;t wear a mask"</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> during the attack to the school when Kazuki tries to disguise himself with a scarf covering his face but it doesn't work as his friends have known him so long they can recognize him from afar just by the way he walks and don't even need to see his face. Tokiko's disguise during the same attack is a straighter, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> example. She's just wearing Kazuki's uniform jacket over her usual look, but being a very recent transfer student her unusual uniform is her most distinguishing feature anyway and covering it up does a good job hiding her identity alongside the artificial fog that's blanketing the school.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> plays with, subverts, and justifies this two different times in two very unusual ways. The first is with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">All Might</a>, a titanic and muscular powerhouse whose punches can alter weather patterns; however, it's revealed that his muscular form comes from his power and, as he puts it, "flexing". When he stops "flexing" he returns to his true form: a completely unassuming guy who's skin-and-bones, thanks to an old wound that limits how much he can use his powers continuously. Early in the story All Might chooses the powerless Izuku Midoriya to inherit his powers, but they have to keep it a secret lest villains realize that the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Symbol of Peace</a>" is weakening. A few people like Izuku's classmates have noticed that his powers are physical enhancement-based like All Might's, but the fact that his usage doesn't include massive muscle gain just makes it look like they're similar rather than the same.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HarlemBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HarlemBeat">Harlem Beat</a></em>, Shu of Three Men is the alter ego of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sakurai Shuuji</span>. Their only differences are the shades and attitude.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Pretty Sammy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Spoofed at the end of the TV series, where the entire class reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyKnewAlready">they knew that Sasami was Sammy, but figured they weren't supposed to talk about it.</a>
</li><li> Played straight in the OVA series - this was one of the main reasons why Sasami didn't want to be Pretty Sammy (the other was that the costume is ridiculous). However, when she goes on her first fight, no one recognizes her, so she takes it as a good sign. However, there were only three OVAs made, so it's not known if they would have went the TV route.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> often has Sebastian go undercover at certain locations. His disguise? A pair of oval glasses, his hair slightly brushed back and different clothes. Particularly noticeable during the Weston College arc, where he easily is not recognized by most characters that know him. Pointed out on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangareader.net/kuroshitsuji/75/11">this page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with Marquise Midford and Elizabeth recognizing him instantly. Yet Edward, who has not only seen Sebastian being Ciel's butler, but is also a student at the school, never recognized him until it's spelled out to him.
</li><li> In fact, <em>most</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> look similar to their civilian counterparts, and before the 2000s, they usually looked <em>exactly the same</em>. Modern series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em> tend to change the characters' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairColors">hair colour</a>, eye colour and hairstyle to something extravagant enough that it would certainly distract any onlooker enough not to notice the magical girl's identical face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">Maybe it wouldn't matter much if they did, anyway.</a>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplaying</a>, particularly odd case, considering that, in their Mew Mew forms, the Mew Mews only add a "Mew" to their first name (e.g. Mew Ichigo) and somehow that prevents people from figuring it out &mdash; granted, in the manga (the original Japanese version anyway), the names aren't <em>written</em> the same, but this doesn't matter when it's shouted across the street. Though, in both versions, Ichigo's crush Masaya <em>nearly</em> recognizes her in her transformed form, and later figures out her identity. Another exception is that Minto was able to recognize the mysterious Mew Mew as her idol/crush Zakuro. And at least in the anime it doesn't even need the half of the show to let the enemy aliens know, who the Tokyo Mew Mew really are. So the disguises are mostly useless later on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em> subverts the trope because regardless of their hair changes in color and style the enemy quickly figure out who the Pretty Cure are. As early as episode 3 Pisard simply follows some girls he sees wearing the same school uniforms as the cures and picks them out in a crowd. From then on they are attacked personally whether in civilian form or not. This continues up through Heartcatch with the only people unaware of who the Pretty Cures are are their family and friends. The enemy knows who they are from the start.
<ul><li> And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure">Smile Pretty Cure!</a></em> averts this big time - everyone who's snapped out of the Bad End spell easily recognizes the Cures. It doesn't help that Miyuki can't keep her big mouth shut.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars">Pretty Cure All Stars</a></em> movies also avert this through different means. The first movie have the girls figure out who was who after realizing they were going to places the others usually hung out at in their series. The second through fourth movies, their secrets are blown by their fairy companions, particularly <em>DX 3</em> and <em>New Stage</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure">Hummy's</a> actions lead to them putting two and two together.
</li><li> It was pointed out, though, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes! Pretty Cure 5</a></em>, that their costumes did absolutely nothing to hide who they were, and panicked when they spotted the school reporter around. However, Natts usually steps in and uses his charm to woo her and get her to forget about capturing the girls on film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em> has this with the fairies: whenever they need to be around the girls and not raise suspicious, they tend to just go limp and act like dolls and no one really questions why three teenaged girls are toting around strange dolls (though Itsuki does get a pass somewhat - around that time, she was starting to really loosen up). The only time the fairies don't act like this is around little kids.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure">Suite Pretty Cure &#9834;</a></em>, they are three people who tries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a>. The first one is Ako Shirabe/Cure Muse/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess of Major Land</span> would make Clark Kent green with envy &mdash; switch her personality to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>. It work like the charm.
</li><li> As long as her airheadedness doesn't get in the way, the second one &mdash; Hammy, the Cat-Fairy &mdash; can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a> as a originally Earth cat.
</li><li> Averted with the third one &mdash; Ellen/Siren &mdash; in the first episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure">Happiness Charge Pretty Cure</a></em> manages to break the land speed record here, with Megumi and Hime having their identities uncovered by a civilian within <em>the first three episodes</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope applies mostly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior">Magical Girl Warriors</a>, though.

</li><li> Played straight with Master Roshi as Jackie Chun, though &mdash; he removes his usual shades and puts on a wig.

</li><li> After the successful hijacking of a plane with Yutaka Takenouchi headed towards the US, one of the hijackers tries to avoid arrest by going to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em> and disguising as Takenouchi himself. The hijacker's disguise is actually his own mask with the kanji for 'Take' in 'Takenouchi' imprinted on it, but it somehow fools everybody in Cromartie into thinking he <em>is</em> Takenouchi. His disguise is a setup for some crazy situations, one in which Masked Takenouchi tells a story that gives the impression that Takenouchi has changed his character for the better, as if he had a rough life and a big criminal record. (The imposter is in his 30's.) Hayashida finally figures out at the beginning of <em>Cromartie</em> Volume 4 that there are TWO Takenouchis, as the real one has finally come back to the US... on a bullet train with Cromartie's students on it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It doesn't help at all, then, that Masked Takenouchi suffers from motion sickness as well.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em> is another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> anime that uses this trope.
<ul><li> Ahiru doesn't really look all that different from Princess Tutu at first glance &mdash; even her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">Idiot Hair</a> is still there, although the rest of her hairstyle seems to be cut shorter. However, Fakir is <em>actively</em> looking for Tutu and never notices the resemblance until Ahiru behaves so suspiciously (while wearing the necklace that Fakir <em>knows</em> Tutu needs to transform) that Fakir CAN'T deny it anymore. However, the trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> similarly to Christopher Reeve's Superman &mdash; while Ahiru is klutzy, an awkward dancer and scatterbrained, Princess Tutu is graceful, poised, and expresses herself easily. Also, Tutu looks like an older version of Ahiru, including gaining a few inches of height and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower">a more womanly figure</a>. Plus, to most people, Princess Tutu appears to be an enormous swan.
</li><li> This trope applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> Princess Kraehe as well. The only difference between her and Rue is a different hairstyle, slightly narrower eyes, and heavy makeup, yet none of the characters seem to make the connection until Rue reveals herself.
</li></ul></li><li> Not only doesn't anyone deduce any main character's secret identity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> (despite them using no disguise at all, with the exception of Tuxedo Mask and Sailor V), but most of the time the villains don't even bother to try.
<ul><li> Notable exceptions are Nephrite and Zoisite: The former tried to find Sailor Moon by sending fake love letters from Tuxedo Mask, but eventually followed a false trail in the form of Naru; the latter discovered Tuxedo Mask's identity by pulling off his mask, proving that Clark Kenting seems to work on everyone but him. Most other adaptations don't seem to use the trope explicitly, although there they tend not to meet people they know while in costume anyway.
</li><li> Usagi herself is the worst, surpassing even <em>Superman.</em> Her costume is identical to her school uniform, just cut a bit differently. She does <em>not</em> act differently in and out of suit (for want of a better way to refer to it, because again, it's a very very <strong>very</strong> minimal costume change.) Yet people who see both of them <em>repeatedly</em> never connect them, and yes, villains trying to find her identity <em>did</em> believe it was Naru (who looks, talks, and acts nothing like her) and not Usagi. Nothing less than directly witnessing her transforming can make someone connect the two.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> dodged this trope completely &mdash; many people do recognize the Senshi out of costume, most notably Mamoru when he meets Usagi again after having seen her as Sailor Moon, Haruka and Michiru, who deliberately keep their distance, and numerous villains that target the Senshi one by one outside of battle without ever having met them before. A few minor characters also recognized the girls if they knew them as civilians and then later saw them as Senshi. Yet oddly Zoicite even notices that Usagi has the same hair-style as Sailor Moon, yet shrugs it off as the current fad. Also, most of the later villains could sense the Senshi by their energy, rendering the whole secret identity thing pointless.
</li><li> The manga scene referenced above has <em>both</em> Mamoru and Usagi recognizing each other as Tuxedo Mask and Sailor Moon while in civilian clothes &mdash; or at least noticing the similarity. The key difference is that Usagi <em>denies</em> the possibility of Mamoru being her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a>, while Mamoru actually takes the fact into account, suggesting that the ability to recognize the characters in disguise really depends on the person. (In contrast to the anime version, where Mamoru seemingly fails to draw a parallel between the Moon Princess, Usagi and Sailor Moon almost until she actually transformed in front of him.)
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</a></em>, the Sailor Senshi have black or brown hair and more or less plausible hairstyles in civilian forms, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a> changes their hair to resemble the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">the styles and colors seen in the anime</a>. It never explains why, but it's a lot more plausible as a disguise. And with such a radical change in appearance, Ami <em>still</em> recognizes Usagi at first glance. Then again, she is a genius. And the best part? Even when they're transformed, <em>they address each other by their civilian names.</em> In front of everyone. Go figure. This was possibly carried over from the original edition of the manga, where they do call each other by their real names, although with some of the manga villains being able to recognize them anyway, this was at least excusable. Additionally Minako recognises Rei as Sailor Mars instantly when the two accidentally bump into each other in their civvies.
</li><li> This goes both ways, as many recurring villains are never recognised from one flimsy disguise to the next. In fact, most of the villains "diguises" are just a change of clothes and nothing else. Jadeite was probably one of the worst, frequently appearing in public without even so much as a mask or glasses. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC">DiC</a> English dub created an even more hilarious example - his name had been changed to "Jedite" and he was disguising himself as a priest named "Jed." Serena, who knows his name <em>and</em> his face, doesn't recognize him simply because he's changed his clothes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SailorMoonAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SailorMoonAbridged">The Abridged Series</a> points this out:
<div class="indent"><strong>Jadeite:</strong> This plan will surely work this time, because my glasses to disguise myself are <em>much</em> better than last episode's.
</div></li><li> Also in the anime the Senshi themselves can't even see through each other's Clark Kenting without being clued in. They only recognized civilian!Minako because Artemis was with her despite meeting her as Venus in the previous episode. The first few appearances of Haruka and Michiru had them appear as shadows while in civilian form, then once their civilian form was introduced this stopped and it still took a number episodes for Moon and the Guardian Senshi to discover they were the same people (As well as the reverse) even thought it's blatantly clear to the viewers. Setsuna also has to tell Usagi who she is though she seemed to had guessed at it.
</li><li> An interesting occurrence in the S season - Usagi and co. defeat Kaolinite and assume her to be dead. Some ten episodes later, Usagi visits Dr. Tomoe and sees Kaolinite there; and yes, she does go all "OMG the villain is alive!". But then Tomoe says it's just his assistant, <em>Kaori</em>, so Usagi assumes it's just two people with the exact same face and almost the same name. The dub (in which Kaolinite is called Kaori Night) takes it one step further - the "Kaori" alias was changed to... Kaori Night. So now, Serena assumes that they're just two people with the exact same face and the exact same name. Usagi was also thrown off by the fact that Kaolinite was actually being nice and seemed normal. And she probably had to wonder why Kaolinite would be in a seemingly nice house and have stopped trying to extract pure hearts. But still, you'd think she'd keep a close eye on her (especially with Hotaru's behavior toward "Kaori") and have told the others about it.
</li><li> The behavior difference is also likely what keeps Usagi and co. from recognizing Uranus and Neptune as Haruka and Michiru. When in their civilian forms, the two are very nice to them, in contrast to their Senshi identities. But, you'd think that the more experienced Haruka and Michiru could figure out that Usagi is Sailor Moon &mdash; <em>unless</em> you support the theory that no one in their sane mind would suspect a clumsy crybaby of being a "soldier of love and justice" (as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> once by a badly disguised Sailor Venus trying -and succeeding- to convince them and Kaolinite that Usagi wasn't Sailor Moon. In fact, Uranus seemed rather surprised when Kaolinite said that Usagi was Sailor Moon...).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries">Abridged Series</a>, as such series like to do, points out the many flaws in their disguises
<div class="indent"> <strong>Serena</strong>: Look, Luna, I got a letter from Tuxedo Mask! <br><strong>Luna</strong>: How the hell did he find you? <br><strong>Serena</strong>: His love led him to me! <br><strong>Luna</strong>: It was probably that your hair is pretty... unique. And you you don't wear a mask.
</div></li><li> In one manga chapter of the first dramatic arc, Usagi tells her father that she is Sailor Moon, despite the fact that clear photos of her senshi form has appeared all over the news, he doesn't believe her.

There is also a season 1 episode where Zoicite is disguised as a fake Sailor Moon - and saves an innocent. Usagi is among the crowd of people that sees this, which could throw Naru off the scent... At least until R, when she all but admits to Usagi she guessed it.
</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> in an incident in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>: police inspector Wakagi sees Minako and <em>does</em> associate her to Sailor V, but <em>immediately</em> chastize himself for it because lately he's grown so obsessed on Sailor V he <em>mistakes for her every single girl who wears a ribbon in her hair</em>.
</li><li> Another justification in the manga is that most people don't <em>want</em> to believe that ditzy Usagi, crazy Minako, shy Ami, stoic and cynical Rei and (alleged) bully Makoto are a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">hammy</a> superheroes. The only one who could be discovered is Minako, who is incredibly hammy even as a civilian... Except the one time her childhood friend Hikaru met Sailor V she acted meeker than usual, throwing her off course.
</li><li> In the manga Minako's disguise is also helped by the fact <em>everyone</em> knows that Sailor V works with the police (actually false for most of her career, a youma simply assumed and sent her challenge letter for V to the police and the public fell for it), thus she couldn't be known cop-hater Minako Aino.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></em>. People don't recognize them, even though they're fired out of <em>a cannon</em> built into the pizza parlor, they have the same names as their alter-egos, and their combat forms are largely their civilian forms with some extra armor and weapons bolted on. In one episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">the narrator remarks</a> "No one recognizes our samurai heroes in their secret identities! Don't ask why, just one of the quirks of the show."
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeishoujoSenshiSaintValkyrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeishoujoSenshiSaintValkyrie">Seishoujo Senshi Saint Valkyrie</a></em> skewers this &mdash; <em>everyone</em> recognizes that Ai Hayama is Valkyrie Ai, despite her frantic protestations to the contrary.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WeddingPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WeddingPeach">Wedding Peach</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> actually acts as a shield to keep the devils from seeing who the love angels are. So this is justified... sort of.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, Char Aznable adopts the pseudonym "Quattro Bajeena", but his true identity is something of an open secret. The fact that he still uses a mobile suit in his signature color of bright red doesn't help.
<ul><li> This is more of a subversion - since most of the AEUG had never actually seen the infamous Red Comet, they wouldn't of known that this shade-wearing man was actually a Zeon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>. It isn't until the heroes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> step in that Char's identity is revealed. It's later shown that the founder of the AEUG knew all along, and unsuccessfully attempted to get Char to reveal himself publicly and become the new leader.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">&forall; Gundam</a></em>
<ul><li> Loran disguises himself as "Laura Rolla" because he's a former Moonrace scout who's now piloting a rather powerful mobile suit with the Earth militia. He fully dresses for the part, complete with stays, a dress, makeup, and lessons in deportment from Kihel, so that he appears as an elegant young lady who also happens to be the militia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a>. It works for <em>quite</em> a long time&mdash;only Harry Ord manages to see through it.
</li><li> Harry himself goes incognito at the <em>Willgem</em> excavation site by putting on civilian clothes and a pair of normal glasses. Although he employs his usual tacky fashion sense (bright yellow-black argyle sweatervest and a pink shirt) and makes no effort to disguise his voice, it's sufficient to fool not only Loran but <em>Queen Dianna</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>, Athrun Zala pulls the same stunt Char did, disguising himself as "Alex Dino", Cagalli Yula Atha's bodyguard. People see through his disguise rather easily.
</li><li> Kenshiro Kasumi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheBlueSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheBlueSky">Fist of the Blue Sky</a></em> disguises his true identity as "Yan-Wang" in public by giving himself a nerdy hairstyle and glasses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Usopp when disguised as Sogeking. The mask still reveals his long nose and he still wears his everyday clothes under his cape. The only two people fooled by this are Chopper and Luffy. Usopp eventually develops a split personality that talks and acts differently when wearing the mask.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>, the Kunoichi character Kaede uses a pair of glasses to disguise herself. Everyone sees through it except the ninjas chasing after her, whose disguises are just as minimalistic. (One is wearing a surgical mask, the other just painted two stripes on her eyepatch, and the ancient clan leader is also wearing glasses.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, Sena is the eponymous Eyeshield 21, a running back with unbeatable speed. Sena is the only one with a build and height even remotely close to his "secret" identity. Most of the time he doesn't even bother coming up with a good excuse for not being there when Eyeshield 21 is. Mamori, his childhood friend and the team's manager, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">really takes a while to figure things out</a>, given the clues she has on hand.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Rise Kujikawa</a> tries this, but it doesn't work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Kateky&#333; Hitman Reborn!</a></em>, the title character often uses a variety of different disguises that can be easily seen through by the audience, but Tsuna is the only in-universe character that shares this view.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade">Bamboo Blade</a></em>. When Kojiro asks Tamaki to dress up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTransferStudent">new freshman</a> named "Bureiba" in order to fulfill his kendo team's five-member quota, his old mentor (who coaches Machido High School's all-girls team) isn't fooled, and notices during a friendly match with Kojiro's team that Tamaki's and "Bureiba"'s fighting styles are similar. After challenging "Bureiba" to an impromptu match (and losing handily), he states that he knew all along, but lets it slide because it was just for practice
</li><li> On the first glance, Lelouch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> doesn't clark-kent, the full face mask and all. But on the other hand, if you remember that Nunnally is blind and tells people apart by their voices... Yes he does.
<ul><li> There's a voice changer installed in his helmet. It doesn't make a <em>lot</em> of difference, but...
<ul><li> Lelouch also changes the demeanor considerably; as himself he's a soft-spoken, kindly big brother as far as Nunnally is concerned, while as Zero he is a megalomaniac <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A straighter example would be Euphemia li Britannia, who disguises herself amidst hostages under a pair of Clark Kent glasses. Nobody, not even the perpetrators know it's her until she takes them off and says who she is.
<ul><li> It helps that nobody knew that there would be Britannian princess present at all, so they weren't looking for her. Also, at this point Euphemia is not very important, as far as the Britannian royalty goes, and not that many people know how she looks.
</li></ul></li><li> Lelouch and Nunnally are also exiled Britannian royalty, and they hide in plain sight under their real first names but using the made-up last name Lamperouge. Granted, they were somewhat obscure, were only kids when they were exiled, and the world at large thinks they died when they were kids, though one wonders what would have happened if one of their siblings looked at a phone book or a Ashford yearbook. It's likely that since the Ashfords are <em>hiding</em> the siblings means they likely have a set up to avoid that possibility. Of course, they are officially dead and who will look in a "commoner" school for royalty?
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in Ryuusei no Rockman and Ryuusei no Rockman Tribe. Subaru Hoshikawa saves Luna Shirogane's life (several times!), but she does not know it is him. She has a crush on Rockman, and ironically, he is the same kid who goes to school with her and at whose house she tries to bake food for Rockman. Kizamaro Saishoin was one of the first to suspect that Subaru's real identity was Rockman, and by Ryuusei no Rockman Tribe, it's common knowledge to both him and Gonta Ushijima. Paradoxically, Luna refuses to admit this, and for the most part no one (even Subaru!) points out any of the many flaws in her logic. Eventually, however, as the series moves on, she seems to start like Subaru as well as Rockman, and in a touching moment before Rockman enters the Denpa-wave zone, she calls him 'Subaru' and tells him she is supporting him.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>, when Hayate instantly sees through Nagi's disguise as "Mask the Money." But then played hilariously straight when Maria puts on sunglasses and claims to be a superhero maid &mdash; Nagi, her employer, fails to recognize her <em>and wants to get her autograph</em>.
<ul><li> Could be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the anime, whenever Maria tries to make herself incognito, she always chooses a pair of spectacles which has the effect of attracting gazes/confessions from guys AND being identified almost immediately from those she's trying to disguise from.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamikazeKaitouJeanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamikazeKaitouJeanne">Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne</a></em> in which several people comment that Maron and Jeanne resemble each other. In fact Miyako's whole reason for trying to capture Jeanne is so that she can prove Maron's innocence. Made even more ironic in that Jeanne has not only a different hairstyle but also a <em>completely different hair color</em> than Maron.
</li><li> Used in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> where Kaname disguises herself by putting on a kimono and makeup and putting her hair up. Between this and her very different behavior, nobody - not even Kaname's devoted bodyguard Sosuke - connects the attractive blue-haired teenage girl who'd left previously to the attractive blue-haired woman who's just arrived.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DoctorSlump">Doctor Slump</a></em>, Suppaman (an inept Superman parody) disguises himself as a reporter named <em>Kuraaku Kenta</em>. Naturally, Penguin Village being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLand">Cloud Cuckoo Land</a>, nobody ever recognizes him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> has Lieutenant Hawkeye disguise herself by putting on glasses and letting down her hair. <a class="urllink" href="http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i212/Kerrah_photos/Glasses.jpg">Ed and Al are dumbfounded upon the (rather quick) realisation that the young, blonde, gun-wielding woman who has rushed to their aid is young, blonde, gun-wielding Hawkeye.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> This does not fool <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fuhrer Bradley</span> for a second, with his Perfect Eye and all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zorro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zorro">Zorro</a></em>'s usual costume plays this trope already quite straight, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaiketsuZorro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaiketsuZorro">Kaiketsu Zorro</a></em>, all Diego does is put on a cape, a hat and a less covering than usual mask that doesn't hide his friggin' hair!
</li><li> If anything, Kotetsu T. Kaburagi (AKA Wild Tiger) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em> is an even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">more over-the-top</a> example of Clark Kenting than Superman, possibly in reference to him-his design has a lot of nods to Western superheroes, anyway. As it'd be cumbersome for him to wear his costume in public at company-sponsored parties, especially now that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, Kotetsu has to act as his Wild Tiger superhero identity outside of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>. It might have worked in his traditional costume, which looked a little like Batman's costume, as it made it harder to compare his alter ego's face to his actual face in the same way that Clark and Superman have the same face-but now that he's wearing Powered Armor, a skilled observer could easily tell that Wild Tiger and Kotetsu are one and the same. How obvious is the Clark Kenting, you ask? He goes about doing this by dressing exactly as he always does - same waistcoat, same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a>, and same goatee - but with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask">Domino Mask</a>. <em>On public television</em>.
<ul><li> At one point, Kotetsu tries to prove to an Apollon Media security guard that he's Wild Tiger <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unpersoned</a></span> by putting on his mask in front of him. The guard points out that most people (including him) don't really pay attention to what Wild Tiger actually looks like beyond a few easily replicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinguishingMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinguishingMark">Distinguishing Marks</a>, and that he could easily be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCostumeNeedsWork">reasonably convincing cosplayer</a> trying to sneak in &mdash; something the guard deals with all the time.
</li><li> Somehow, it even manages to fool <em>his own daughter</em>.
</li><li> Karina Lyle (Blue Rose) and Pao-lin (Dragon Kid) are also examples as they go unmasked all the time, using only colored wigs and, in Karina's case, makeup, colored contact lenses, and breast padding, to disguise their identities.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinRevolution">Penguin Revolution</a></em>, actor Ayaori Mashiba conceals his identity from the public by using the stage name "Makoto Ayaori," and by wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a> and leaving his hair in a disordered mess when he's not on the job. The only person shown to ever see through this is the heroine, Yukari, who recognizes him only thanks to her unique ability to perceive star talent in the form of visible wings. The trope is justified in that Ayaori is an incredibly talented actor (although you'd think someone would at least notice the name).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmaster">The Idolmaster</a></em> - Haruka puts on glasses (and a hat) to avoid being recognized in public.
</li><li> Subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaitouSaintTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaitouSaintTail">Kaitou Saint Tail</a></em>: while the only differences in look between Meimi and Saint Tail are the clothes and the ponytail, Meimi acts completely different as Saint Tail (most evident part, Meimi is quite shy but becomes a showoff as Saint Tail), takes great care at not using her magic tricks as Meimi (even before becoming Saint Tail, as she planned to become a professional illusionist and her father had told her to not show them in public until then) and goes to extreme lenghts to not show her face as Saint Tail. In spite of this, she was nearly found out a number of times, both by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival in love</a> Rina (a few stories were dedicated to Meimi's attempts at convincing Rina that Meimi wasn't Saint Tail, ending when Rina was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">traumatized into thinking that Saint Tail was a moustached adult man</a>) and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist</a> Asuka Jr. (who in the end concluded that Meimi and St. Tail are merely lookalikes).
</li><li> Played straight and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco">Samurai Flamenco</a></em>. Masayoshi is initially the prime suspect when rumors about the title vigilante's identity begin forming, and he's only acquitted because an impostor steps in and claims to be the <em>real</em> Samumenco. Played straight with the Flamenco Girls, who are all popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singers</a> in their civilian identities, and yet somehow effectively disguise themselves with little more than wigs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DominoMask">Domino Masks</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RollingGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RollingGirls">Rolling Girls</a></em>, Masami moonlights as a costumed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>-like hero known as Maccha Green. <em>Nobody</em> but the protagonist, Nozomi, is actually fooled by this, and it later turns out that everyone just humors Masami because they don't want her to be embarrassed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UchiNoMusumeNiTeODasuNa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UchiNoMusumeNiTeODasuNa">Uchi no Musume ni Te o Dasu na!</a></em>: Clara's superhero costume doesn't even come with a mask, and she's constantly seen on news broadcasts everywhere. So you'd think all of Tokyo would know Clara Haruko is the Eighth Wonder. Nope. The only ones who do are her mom, Clara's secret crush <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mei</span>, and her friends at N.U.D.E. HQ.
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> manga, no one can tell that Nikki is Sonic. The only difference between the two is that Nikki is timid, he wears clothes, and he wears glasses.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MisappropriationInvestigatorNakaboRintaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MisappropriationInvestigatorNakaboRintaro">Misappropriation Investigator Nakabo Rintaro</a></em> often appears in his civilian persona, 'Hayashi Taro', who is considerably more well-combed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualSmiler">always smiles.</a> Press his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> though, and he'll ditch the disguise in an instant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>: Berserker's distinct armor is unrecognizable to other characters thanks to his Noble Phantasm "For Someone's Glory". For Someone's Glory is normally an ability that allows the user to disguise themselves as another person, but Berserker's Mad Enhancement makes him unable to use the skills full potential without the use of Command Seals. Thus, For Someone's Glory manifests itself as a black, foggy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Battle Aura</a>, which still obscures his appearance to other people and hides his status and parameters. While the audience are able to see his appearance, the characters only see a "black thing" and they cannot grasp his shape. Once For Someone's Glory is deactivated, characters who knew him in life are instantly able to recognize his armor and identity.

</li><li> In <em>Yume Kira Dream</em>, Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi use their Yume Kira bags to transform into and gain the skills of a specific occupation.

Matsuya undoes her ponytail and puts on a pair of glasses when she sneaks into a ILL Electronics store to look at the merchandise. Sumiyoshi spots her immediately. Her "Eeeeek!" at being discovered was uncharacteristic and quite charming.

<ul><li> Alison Carter is a borderline example when she appears in the sequel, <em>Ghosts of the Past</em> - she didn't have a dual identity, and her status as the first Agent 13 and later, Deputy Director of SHIELD (Retired <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until after <em>Forever Red</em></span>), wasn't hidden, but SHIELD itself was.

When a Muggleborn first year is the only one to recognize them, "Rowena" and "Salazar" comment that they needed four teachers for the school and that "Wizards and witches may have a lot of power, but they don't have a lot of common sense."

<ul><li> Shinji's costume might be cheap, but at least it hides his face.
</li><li> Shirley's costume barely obscures her face at all. In fact, she actually has to wear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> in her civilian identity, since otherwise people would notice her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotAntennae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotAntennae">"Robot Ears"</a>.

</li><li> Toward the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/OriginStory">Origin Story</a></em>, after Alex Harris decides to act as a superhero under the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superwoman</a>, her partner Louise insists that she keep a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>. To do that, she starts wearing a pair of glasses and a dark colored wig as Alex Harris. Even she admits, though, that she mostly relies on the fact that people are too busy staring at her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleavageWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleavageWindow">Cleavage Window</a> to notice her face when she's in costume.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a></em>, Prince Blueblood is able to disguise himself by removing his trademark suit and messing up his mane. It works mostly because hardly anyone is aware he's no longer a vain, self-centered jerk, so they would never associate a dirty, unregal looking pony with him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AdoptedDisplaced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AdoptedDisplaced">Batmare Beyond</a></em>, Rarity realises she runs the risk of being identified as the new "Batman" if she lets herself be seen, as she's the only known unicorn on Earth, and plans to avert this using magical illusions. However, when she <em>does</em> get photographed in costume and printed in the newspaper, no one makes the connection despite Rarity being in another photo (from a Wayne funded charity auction) on the same page, in more or less the same pose and with the same facial expression. This leads her to declare that, "The entire population of Earth are <em>morons</em>!"
<ul><li> Ironically Bruce gives a surprisingly sound explanation for why this is possible, quoted below (part of the omitted portion of the text referencing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>).
</li></ul><div class="indent"> "Magic...several ancient cultures had beliefs, rituals, and ceremonies surrounding masks. The idea of the use of the masks was that, in donning it, you became the entity the mask represented, leaving your normal identity behind. My own experience has since revealed that those ancient cultures had a great deal of powerful magic at their disposal. It could very well be that there's some sort of magic behind that concept of masks suppressing your true self, bound in the very weft of Earth's magical field...one that protects those who don masks - metaphorical or otherwise - to protect people."

His secret identity consists of wearing a tench coat and glasses, without making any attempt to hide the fact he's a Draconequus. This at least works on some ponies, including Mirror Fluttershy. In part because she assumes Sir Discord is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutThem">Blind Without Them</a>, so taking his glasses off to fight crime makes no sense. That and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">she can't imagine a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> would purposefully masquerade as a powerless person.
<ul><li> It's also shown earlier that Mirror!Ahuizotl/Bravery Blue pulls the same trick as prime Daring Do. Except while her disguise is more complete and she's a pony, Ahuizotl is still an...well, Ahuizotl.

It's good enough to leave even the Japanese Wardens looking for them on behalf of the White Council clueless, and the main reason Harry himself manages to make any more progress than they when he arrives in Japan is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the orphaned girl he adopted</span> in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9125896/1/The-Senshi-File-Red-Eye">the prequel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> turns out to be the missing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sailor Jupiter</span>.

To do this, she dyes her naturally white hair red and puts on a pair of Beebo blue glasses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LifeOreDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LifeOreDeath">Life Ore Death</a></em> this trope is variously subverted, averted, justified, and reconstructed at different times, even by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> himself. In one arc, Superman disguises himself as "Carl Keanes," a legally blind man with a Seeing Eye dog, and mentions that Batman gave him lessons. That said, he still is clark Kent in daily life, and there are two explanations for how he gets away with it. 1) Kryptonians have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">a different arrangement of facial muscles</a>, so by making faces he can drastically change his looks. 2) Earth-16 humans are suggested to have decreased facial recognition abilities, as Ferris and Miss Martian both recognize faces in ways their teammates repeatedly fail to.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rio2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rio2">Rio 2</a></em>, Pedro and Nico don't seem to realize the very talented cockatoo with the leaf over his face is Nigel, the antagonist from the first film. Rafael is at the very least suspicious.
</li><li> Both Jafar and Jasmine fail to recognize "Prince Ali" as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a>, in spite of the fact that he's done nothing to alter his appearance or voice (other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">clean up</a>). Both catch on, though Jafar only when he sees that Aladdin has the lamp and Jasmine when she remembers his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>. In the latter's defense, she <em>did</em> think he was dead and did sense something familiar about him when she got a good look at him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BarbieInPrincessPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BarbieInPrincessPower">Barbie in Princess Power</a></em>, as Super Sparkle, Kara wears a domino mask to hide her identity.
</li><li> Nobody recognizes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em> at the ball as the stepdaughter/servant of the Tremaines. It might be justified by having been kept in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a>'s house since she was a young girl. But neither her stepsisters or stepmother recognize her, though Lady Tremaine <em>is</em> shown to observe that there's something familiar about her, but is prevented from getting a closer look.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trolls">Trolls</a></em>, Bridget is frequently in the presence of Gristle or Chef, but neither of them recognize her when she puts on some new clothes and a wig (and a more confident attitude). Granted, they probably don't pay much attention to the servants.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TownMusiciansOfBremen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TownMusiciansOfBremen">Town Musicians of Bremen</a></em>, the musicians seem to become unrecognizable for the rest of the characters the moment they alter their appearance even slightly:
<ul><li> In the first cartoon, they pretend to be a robber gang for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredHeroics">Engineered Heroics</a>, with hardly any disguise. Both the King and his guards are completely fooled. Though it can be justified, since the guards quickly flee the scene and the King is scared senseless.
</li><li> In the sequel, the musicians (except for the Troubadour) dress up as a foreign rock group, and again nobody figures them out for quite a while. Even though they are watched by the Princess (who has actually traveled with them), the King and a huge townsfolk crowd (who have seen them performing before), and a supposedly genius detective.

</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the classic Richard Donner <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em> films, whose take on this trope has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">migrated to canon</a> in at least some comic continuities. Christopher Reeve's vastly differing portrayals of Clark Kent and Superman really made you feel that he could get away with the disguise. To play the role of Clark Kent, he wore the glasses and slicked his hair back, sure, but he also slouched, stammered, and raised his voice by an octave so that there was a tangible difference between Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent and Christopher Reeve as Superman. This is most obvious in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIaF0QKtY0c">this scene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em>Superman</em> where he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnConfession">about to tell Lois the truth (but doesn't)</a>, and in <em>Superman II</em> where she figures it out on her own. All Reeve does is stand up straight and speak in his normal voice and suddenly he's another person. <em>Superman II</em>, <em>3</em>, and <em>4</em> also throw in a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> to the mix by making Clark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">The Klutz</a> to add to the disguise.
<ul><li> In an interview given after Reeve's death, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargotKidder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargotKidder">Margot Kidder</a> (Lois) says that Reeve was <em>adamant</em> that Clark Kent behave nothing like Superman. To paraphrase Kidder, "Clark moves differently, his shoulders are held differently... he's a completely different person."
</li><li> A similar good example comes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>, where Lois explains Superman's height to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Richard</a>. Richard then says: "How tall would you say Clark is?" The two then go on to note other physical similarities between Superman and Clark. Clark draws their attention by clumsily knocking something over, then waves at them with a goofy silly/embarrassed grin on his face, looking for all the world like a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditz</a>, and Lois and Richard both burst out laughing.
<ul><li> The scene also demonstrates a particular advantage Superman has in employing this trope: he could hear them talking about him with his super-hearing, starting to make the connection, and was able perfectly time a "Clark Kent moment" to make the suspicion seem ludicrous.
</li></ul></li><li> Ditto for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> film as well. Kara's civilian identity involves giving herself a completely different hairstyle (brown, shorter and curlier). Linkara also points out a few minor differences in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenSlater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenSlater">Helen Slater</a>'s performance, which help make it believable that they are two different people. It probably also helps that nobody has any idea who Supergirl is for the first half of the movie.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryMen">Mystery Men</a></em>, as one of the character realizes that Captain Amazing looks identical to his "benefactor", but without glasses. (He disguises himself the exact same way Superman does.) The theory gets shouted down, as without glasses, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm">couldn't see anything</a>.
</li><li> Semi-Film, Semi-Real Life Example: Albert Walker of <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com">The<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth">Agony Booth</a></em> has twice admitted that he was fooled by the disguises of characters in some of the bad movies he's reviewed, which is shameful given the otherwise low quality of <em>everything else in the given films</em>. Specifically: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gene Simmons in <em>Never Too Young To Die</em>, who dresses up as a friendly agent despite his character being a flagrantly over-the-top transvestite, and Paul Freeman in <em>Shanghai Surprise</em>, supposedly dead and disguised, again, as an ally</span>.
</li><li> Count Olaf (played by Jim Carrey) in the film version of Lemony Snicket's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em> disguises himself as a scientist named Stephano (false mustache and a shaved eyebrow) and a sea captain called Captain Sham (wooden leg, and a beard). Although in the books Olaf can easily be recognised when in disguise because he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinguishingMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinguishingMark">tattoo of an eye on his ankle</a>, his disguises are still comically inept.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the Bill Murray movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuickChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuickChange">Quick Change</a> where even the police were unable to give a good description of the robbers, as they were distracted by the unusual nature of the crime ( bank robbery by a clown).
</li><li> Lampshaded in the movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RabNeBanaDiJodi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RabNeBanaDiJodi">Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi</a></em>: total nerd Suri disguises himself as fashion victim Raj by shaving his mustache, changing haircut and putting other clothes on. He later explains to a friend that if he managed to fool his wife with the disguise, it's only because God decided to help him. The trope is also slightly subverted because, like in Donner's <em>Superman</em> movies, it's not just the clothes that change but the character's whole behaviour. Suri and Raj talk, move and behave differently, which later leads Suri to become jealous of Raj because he wonders if people prefer him (why hello there, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a>!).
</li><li> In <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em> (1939), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> (Basil Rathbone) disguises himself as a singer at a party. His disguise is so good that he feels audacious enough to get on stage in front of everyone and sing a tune. His disguise? Nothing more than a fake mustache. It's all in his facial contortions and mannerisms, and it comes across as plausible that nobody would recognize him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItHappenedOneNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItHappenedOneNight">It Happened One Night</a></em>, Peter and Ellie fool the detectives who are sent by Ellie's father with acting like a low-class married couple.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1943" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1943">The Phantom (1943)</a></em>, Geoffrey Prescott resigns from Professor Davidson's archeological team to take up the heroic mantle of the Phantom, in which role he is called upon to assist Professor Davidson's team. His body language is not much difference when he's being the Phantom, and his mask leaves most of his face clearly visible, but with one exception nobody on the team shows any sign of recognizing him. Diana remarks after her first meeting with the Phantom that he "reminds me of someone we all know, but I just can't place him"; after she's met him a few more times, they have a conversation in which she clearly suspects who he is and offers him several openings to admit it, but he dodges the question and the subject is not raised again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantom1996">The Phantom (1996)</a></em>, the Phantom's body language hardly changes when he's being Kit Walker, and his voice not at all; despite this, nobody seems to realise that they're the same person even after encountering both of them in quick succession, though Diana does eventually admit to having figured it out. Diana figuring out the Phantom's secret identity is foreshadowed in the scene at the newspaper office where Kit talks and poses exactly like the Phantom did just a few scenes earlier, before realizing what he's doing and breaking the pose.
</li><li> Mocked by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em> in their spoof of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> movie. April: "Why do you wear a mask?" Raphael: "So no one knows I'm a turtle, of course!" The turtles' masks are doubly silly because they don't have a secret civilian identity: if anything, their masks exist to reveal their identity, not to conceal it.
</li><li> Cillian Murphy's character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Peacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Peacock">Peacock</a></em> is a quiet wage-slave who keeps to himself. Cillian Murphy's other character in <em>Peacock</em> is a woman who lives in the same house, looks curiously similar, and often appears right after Cillian has gone upstairs (you know, plus the time it would take to put a wig and some eyeliner on). Nobody ever gives any sign of knowing, the only possible rationalization being that maybe in small-town 1950s Nebraska, maybe it just didn't occur to them that Cillian Murphy would probably wear a dress given half a chance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SugarAndSpice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SugarAndSpice">Sugar &amp; Spice</a></em>, the cheerleading squad robs the supermarket bank branch, dressed as... cheerleaders. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Betty doll</a> masks. Arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> because: 1) Who would suspect <em>actual</em> cheerleaders of robbing banks, and: 2) The number of cheerleading groups in a general area.
</li><li> Subverted <em>hilariously</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>. Hal Jordan tries to disguise his voice while speaking to Carol Ferris. It works for about a minute, but as soon as she gets a good look at him she knows who he is. This is made even funnier by the fact that the scene is a direct homage (location, camera angles, entrance, music, etc) to the famous balcony scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Carol:</strong> I've known you my whole life! I've seen you NAKED! You don't think I would recognize you because I can't see your cheekbones?!

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Steel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Steel">Steel</a></em> where the armor covers almost all the protagonist's body. Unfortunately, the title character is 7 feet tall, so it's completely obvious to anyone who sees him in both identities. The cop witness recognizes him, not the least because John has a scar in the exact same spot where Steel had a bleeding wound. The cop feigns ignorance because Steel saved his life earlier. Lampshaded by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Burke:</strong> <em>[upon seeing Steel for the first time]</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Now I wonder who that is</a>.

Borden (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristianBale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristianBale">Christian Bale</a>) and Angier (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman">Hugh Jackman</a>) often adopt disguises to sneak into each other shows, but they tend to just be false beards that don't fool anyone who knows them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then at the end of the movie, it turns out Borden's identical twin (also played by Christian Bale) had been disguising himself as the assistant Fallon <em>the whole movie</em>, and concealed it by wearing big glasses, a hat, a false beard, not speaking, and makeup to make his face look chubbier. In fact, they'd been swapping off; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">Rewatch Bonus</a> is detecting the subtle differences in Borden.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRebelSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRebelSet">The Rebel Set</a></em>, a 1950s B-movie crime caper, had ringleader Ed Platt disguising himself to evade detection <em>from his own gang</em> by wearing a clergyman's collar - this was called out mercilessly on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>.

<ul><li> At the Smithsonian, Steve hides his identity by wearing a big jacket and a baseball cap. Only one awestruck kid recognizes him, but is convinced to keep it secret. May help that Captain America hasn't been in the public eye much for over 70 years in-universe, and his costume usually covered half his face and deliberately drew attention to his chest (no, not for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">that reason</a>).
</li><li> Steve uses this again when he's on the run, wearing a hoodie and thick-rimmed glasses with thick lenses. An Apple employee gives him a querying stare, but it turns out he just recognized that they own the same kind of glasses.
</li><li> Natasha just relies on a hoodie. She shows her experience with this trope by giving advice to Steve on how to remain nondescript, including not running and pretending to be conversing (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeOutMakeOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeOutMakeOut">and kissing</a>).

Bruce goes through the traditional route for this trope by putting on Tony Stark's sunglasses, but Thor points out that he's already in disguise because nobody on the planet knows whe he is, because they've only seen the Hulk. Thor himself is called out for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a> when Valkyrie points out that the blanket Thor haphazardly threw over his head doesn't even conceal his face.

It takes quite a while for the male lead to figure out that Patience is Catwoman. The first thing that tips him off is that they both have similar handwriting - he gets both samples analysed and the expert says that it's obviously two very different people. For the record, Patience's mask really doesn't hide that much of her face.
</li><li> In the Melissa McCarthy vehicle <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spy">Spy</a></em> her character wears several different disguises that are all Paper Thin (wearing various wigs and ugly touristy clothing, or wearing very stylish outfits like ball gowns and leather). Several times she is seen by a few of the same people but they don't realize that she is the same person each time. But parts of that may be her quick thinking nature.

Bill points out that, whereas most heroes have to put on the costume to become their alter egos, since Superman was born as the alien Kal-L, his alter ego is in fact Clark Kent. Bill theorizes that Clark Kent is Superman's critique of humanity, comparing him to the Bride trying to blend, in when she was really born to be a killer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackbird">The Blackbird</a></em>, Dan the criminal and thief disguises himself as his fictional twin brother, "the Bishop", supposedly the operator of a charity mission in the Limehouse slums.

With the masses, it seems to work, mostly because their official portraits are so idealized as to look nothing like they'd looked even when they were younger; at the end it's subverted, as everyone who'd actually <em>known</em> them admits that they'd recognized them both immediately, but kept quiet about it for reasons of politics and/or to respect their wish for anonymity.

This normally wouldn't qualify as an example of this trope due to the handsome prince and the hideous Beast looking nothing like each other, except that the prince <em>wants</em> Beauty to realize his real-life identity and does everything short of telling her outright, including telling her that she's made him unhappy right after she refuses to marry the Beast and <em>changing places repeatedly with an image of the Beast</em> when she asks how she can help him. This makes Beauty look like an even bigger dumbass than Lois Lane; at least Superman actively tries to throw Lois off his scent, whereas the prince <em>constantly</em> tells Beauty to look past appearances and find him "no matter how I may be disguised"! This may be the reason why later adaptations of the story drop that particular detail.

<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Older Than Steam</a>: in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear">King Lear</a></em>, the Earl of Kent(!) returns from banishment in a fairly flimsy disguise to help the king. Even before he goes mad, Lear fails to recognize him along with everyone else, despite having known him for years. Later in the play, after Edgar is accused of plotting against his father the Earl of Gloucester, he tears at his clothes and covers himself with mud to disguise himself as a "Bedlam beggar". The disguise is good enough to fool his father, his godfather King Lear, the Earl of Kent (who is also in disguise and who Edgar fails to recognize) and the King's fool (easily the smartest person in the whole cast). In the final scene of the play, Edgar dons another disguise that fools his half-brother Edmund, though the stage directions imply that he may be masked.
</li><li> In fact, many of Shakespeare's plays use this, including most of the comedies. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure">Measure for Measure</a></em>, the Duke, who rules the city, wanders around speaking to all the main characters with no attempt at disguise other than a priest's robe. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em> and <em>As You Like It</em> women dress as men with little effort other than wearing men's clothing. Rosalind (the protagonist of <em>As You Like It</em>) remarks, in short, that no one will pay attention so long as she wears breeches and carries a sword. Orlando, the man in love with her, doesn't recognize her, even when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCrossdressing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveCrossdressing">"pretends" to be Rosalind</a> so he can practice courting. Most scholars agree these disguises would have been useless and flimsy, so the audience could easily see through them. This, mostly, is the joke, because women were not allowed to act in Shakespearean times; you would have a man who was playing a woman who pretended to be a man imitating a woman and so on. Also, until roughly the 1950s, clothing was how you told who was a man and who was a woman. People just went with the gender suggested by the clothing.

In the anime, Bob Copper actually puts two and two together... and, in a moment of unbelievable stupidity, actually asks if Geo is one of Mega Man's <em>groupies</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFault">Much to Geo's own surprise</a>). In the same anime, when Luna finds out, she goes into a state of complete denial, despite the insistence of Bud and Zack and Omega-Xis showing up in front of them at times. Granted, her denial faded in the final episode of Tribe, but still.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> features a mission in which your character has to infiltrate a Freakshow base. In order to facilitate this mission, you're given a disguise. What is the disguise? A rusty, spiky chestpiece (worn over your regular costume) and a bright red mohawk (ditto).
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, the characters disguise themselves as enemy troops to steal passage aboard a boat. For the most part, this works quite well, as Shinra troops are covered in head to toe with armor and baggy combat jumpsuits, but there are two major exceptions: Barret, the big black dude with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">gun for an arm</a> dressed as a sailor, and Red XIII, a cat/wolf-like creature who can't walk very well on two legs and whose tail sticks out of his uniform!
<ul><li> They actually play with it some in this case. Upon Arrival, one conversation option results in Mr. Gun Arm being described as looking like 'a bear wearing a marshmallow suit', and he ends up hogging up the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror, wearing said sailor suit, if he's not in your party. As for Red XIII... he dances back and forth from foot to foot, obviously having issues standing on two legs, but comments that he 'makes a pretty good human being' when you talk to him... after which he turns to the side, allowing you to see the tail (flaming tip and all) sticking out of his pants.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManaKhemiaAlchemistsOfAlRevis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManaKhemiaAlchemistsOfAlRevis">Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis</a></em>. The resident superhero, "The Flay", fights crime in the school, alongside his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekick</a>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> in the main story. Their costume? It's a mask that covers <em>only their eyes</em>, while still wearing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform">Custom Uniform</a>. And <em>everyone</em> is fooled...
</li><li> Done both ways in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, depending on the team. Spies wear a mask that consists of the face of the class they're disguised as. If you're on their team, you can see them as a spy. If not, well, it's a perfect disguise (until the shooting starts).
<ul><li> Or even before it starts, if you're alone with one and they happen to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">standing right behind you...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Maria in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>. Although more intricate than "standard" Clark Kenting (clothes, hair, cosmetics, <em>vastly</em> different personality) James once mentions that she looks a lot like Mary then never mentions the resemblance again. Heavily justified though in that not only is James completely batshit insane but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it isn't really Mary at all, merely a construct James has invented due to among other things his refusal to accept her death</span>. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">it is a very strange game</a>.
</li><li> Yeager in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> does this when he disguises himself as Regaey. Granted, the name was a dead giveaway, but his demeanor as Regaey was very meek compared to his actual personality.
</li><li> The trope is an essential part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> series of games. Walk calm, wear the right uniform and carry the right gun in the right way (ie. out-of-sight or in off-hand), and no one will notice you're a six-foot-tall, pale, hairless man with a bar code tattoo'd on the back of your head.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin">Silent Assassin</a></em> actually <em>subverts</em> the trope: disguises consist of a simple uniform and sometimes (Russian levels) a hat. It doesn't matter if someone sees your face, getting out of sight and changing uniform <em>will</em> fool that guy, even though your face is clearly visible. There's one exception: the Japanese levels. Guard uniforms here include a balaclava and NV goggles but despite these and the fact that it's night, the snipers scattered around the level WILL recognize you.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution">Absolution</a></em>: disguises will fool regular people but if you run into anyone who is wearing the same clothes as you, they will immediately notice you're not one of them, even at distances large enough to stretch disbelief. The only way to avoid this is to use an "instinct" draining special move that causes 47 to... keep his head down.

His outfit and hairstyle are unchanged from the last time Flint saw him, the only difference being the addition of a mask.
</li><li> Raphael aka Phantom R of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmThiefAndTheEmperorsTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmThiefAndTheEmperorsTreasure">Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperor's Treasure</a></em>. His diguise is wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit">suit</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedoraOfAssKicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedoraOfAssKicking">fedora</a>.

She comes under no suspicion by any of the students she interacts with other than the PC, and the PC only begins putting two and two together when he sees her without her glasses on.

Said disguise consisted of changing her name, wardrobe and hairstyle. She does nothing to conceal her face, and she hasn't aged very much since she was last seen. What makes this curious is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her own daughter, Maya</span> was able to recognize her face from a photo earlier in the series, but doesn't do so now.

Not only does Shantae point out that his magical disguise was just his alter-ego Brandon with a jazzy halter-top, but he also transforms in front of an audience who already knew about his secret identity before-hand due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> popularity. Despite all this, based on his dramatic speech, his identity still manages to be a secret to most of his allies and enemies.

The whole disguise is reliant on changes to her body language, and she does it so effectively that not only does it work on the other characters, but quite a few <em>players</em> were fooled into thinking they were two different women.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a> III</em> where Rean dons a pair of glasses on his first day at work because he's too popular as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryInTheSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryInTheSequel">the Ashen Chevalier</a> and his future students see through his disguise immediately. Played straight for when he travels to different parts of the country where no one recognizes him if he starts wearing his glasses.
<ul><li> In the second game in the series, Machias disguises himself in rebel-held territory by taking his glasses <em>off</em>. It appears to work, possibly because the only people he actually needs to keep his identity (as the son of a key official in the overthrown government) from is the highly unpopular local guard detachment. Everyone else appeared to know who he was and was willing to keep his secret.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>: During the Summer 2018 event, Lancelot buys a bunch of doujinshi from Mash's group. He's only tanned and wears a pair of glasses, yet Mash is unable to recognize to him. It's possible that he used For Someone's Glory to cause this effect, since For Someone's Glory is a Noble Phantasm that allows him to make him unrecognizable to other people.

The Octolings, however, are the sworn enemies of the Inklings, a race of human-like squids who make up the majority of Inkopolis Square's population. So how do the Octolings are able to intermingle with the Inklings without causing animosity? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">They pretend to be Inklings and treat their physical differences (especially with the hair and eyes) as just an exotic trend</a>.

Most superheroes and sidekicks make no attempt to conceal their face, merely changing into their costume, yet their secret identities are never compromised. Lampshaded in season 2 by an employee from Lamia's workplace when she walks into the office late after having defeating a villain as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nightmare</span>.

In reality, he did wear a slouch hat and overcoat in a failed attempt to appear less obvious, but he did not disguise himself as a woman. (In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>, at the end of the war, Northern supporters falsely claimed that Jefferson Davis was captured while disguised as a woman, due to his wearing his wife's overcoat at the time.)

Take off the red jacket to show a black sweatshirt, and now you're a person in a black sweatshirt. Put on a hat, and now you're a person with a hat. If these relatively minor changes in wardrobe and appearance seem to small to fool you, think about how often you might be looking for someone you know <strong>very</strong> well in a crowd, and how often you are <em>actually</em> looking for a specific hat/coat/shirt you know that person frequently or always wears.

He was surprised to find a large crowd of fans who had gathered to see him at a train station completely ignored him when he got off the train.

There is even a story (probably apocryphal) about Groucho house-sitting for a friend in Beverly Hills. He was taking advantage of the swimming pool and had the cops called on him by the neighbors.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira">Shakira</a> went unnoticed in public for a couple of months by wearing modest clothing, going by her middle name and wearing a baseball cap.
</li><li> The use of a fake distinguishing feature such as a scar can make people focus on the scar so much they don't notice any other real details.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Morecambe">Eric Morecambe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, at one time half of the most famous comedy double act in Britain, used to get by in public by taking his trademark glasses off and affecting a limp. His son has stated that this worked so well he wouldn't even get recognized by people sitting next to him on trains or planes.
<ul><li> Although it's possible many people <em>did</em> notice, but were too polite to blurt out "Hey! You look just like Eric Morecambe!" to a complete stranger who was likely well aware of the fact and heartily sick of his friends and relations making jokes about it.
</li></ul></li><li> Many models can have relatively normal lives by simply wearing minimal or no makeup, pulling their hair back into a simple hairstyle like a ponytail, and wearing some reasonably conservative clothing. Since most people see them professionally made up, and often in photoshopped images, it's easy for them to be less noticeable. There are models who've walked into their agency's offices, with pictures of themselves plastered all over the walls, and not been recognized by the staff because they've been in casual clothing and not posing.
<ul><li> For nude models and porn actresses, often merely wearing clothes suffices to make them unrecognizable.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Jewel">Jewel</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmv1VhrtYRo">went onstage at a Karaoke bar as 'Karen'<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, wearing a wig, glasses, and false nose, and was unrecognized. (A few people even called her '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">homely</a>'.) She sang a few of her own songs, to acclaim from the crowd. She then stripped off the disguise and went back in as herself and sang a few. No one made the connection. Admittedly, it was dimly lit.
</li><li> Murderer Ted Bundy was able to walk around in broad daylight for days while a wanted fugitive whose face was plastered all over TV. The only attempt he made at a disguise was drawing a mole on his face with a marker.
</li><li> Anybody who's ever worn glasses for years and then suddenly switched to contacts (or vice versa) knows that you can look like "a whole different person." Glasses come with a very specific set of cultural stereotypes, which are completely destroyed when you get rid of them.
<ul><li> Same thing with, say, wearing a substantial amount of makeup regularly and then suddenly appearing without it.
<ul><li> Or shaving off your facial hair.
</li><li> Or shaving one's head or changing one's hair color substantially.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> PokerStars once <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZZNUj9V5hM">challenged<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> tennis star Rafael Nadal to bluff people into believing that he wasn't Rafa with only a pair of glasses and a golf receptionist's uniform as a disguise. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">He didn't succeed.</a>
</li><li> This is the <em>essence</em> of other tropes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipboardOfAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipboardOfAuthority">Clipboard of Authority</a>. Attitude and body language matter as much as clothing or make-up. If you act like your role, then people assume you really are your role. Discussed further in articles like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thespoon.com/stories/urban.html">"How to Sneak Around."<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> This is more intricate than most examples of this trope, but scientists have developed a wearable device that prevents facial recognition cameras from recognizing the wearer. <a class="urllink" href="http://rt.com/news/glasses-block-face-recognition-544/">It's a pair of glasses.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<ul><li> putting on or taking off glasses is also enough to fool the face id feature on smart phones and computers.
</li></ul></li><li> One interviewer accompanied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a> to the DMV, with only a baseball cap as a disguise. He then watched Gibson visibly "turn off the charm" and become so inconspicuous that only the ID photographer noticed a vague similarity.
</li><li> While not one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesExaminedByTheMythBusters">Tropes Examined By The Myth Busters</a> on the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">they</a> were asked to test this out at their <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXODD49KNCw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=254s">San Diego Comic Con 2012 panel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which they actually did. Here were the results:
<ul><li> Tory went with the glasses disguise and failed miserably.
</li><li> Kari noted that wearing a full costume makes a person a little too suspicious, as if you're trying to hide. Adam, a noted cosplayer who made a game of playing hide and seek by wearing full costumes at each SDCC, found this out the hard way when someone recognized him straight after just donning his cosplay and exiting an elevator.
</li><li> However, Kari then noted that wearing a cap was sufficient enough to fool everyone (she even fooled Grant and other friends when she walked the floor wearing one).
<ul><li> Adam himself told on the show that he is more recognized on the street when he is together with Jamie, because while people can recognize his features, it's Jamie's trademark dressing style that takes the spotlight.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"I <em>might</em> be that guy from that show, but he is <em>definitely</em> that guy from that show."
</div></li></ul></li><li> Tyra Banks once did this live and in person on an episode of <em>The Today Show</em>. Without makeup or hair styling, while walking with a slump and wearing a pair of glasses, she went into the crowd outside the Today set's window as a "production assistant" to ask people about their opinions about supermodels and Tyra Banks in particular. After a couple of minutes of absolutely <em>no one</em> realizing it was her, Banks pulled her hair back, straightened her posture, took the glasses off and suddenly ''became" Tyra Banks, Supermodel. The crowd loved it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/superman-goes-shopping/1511">Superman goes shopping<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Jennifer Grey, star of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing">Dirty Dancing</a></em> et al, accidentally destroyed her career by getting her nose done. Afterwards, even friends didn't recognize her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston">Bryan Cranston</a> once successfully infiltrated the San Francisco Comic Con by cosplaying as his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> character, Walter White. No one expected the "real" Walter White to be wandering around the convention like any other con-goer, and so they assumed he was just a look-alike in a costume.
</li><li> Perhaps more forgivably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">Gene Simmons</a> once allegedly <em>attended</em> a KISS concert without his makeup, and nobody looked twice at him.
</li><li> The whole concept of wearing masks can often fall into this trope, specifically masks that only cover a small portion of the face surrounding the eyes. If the person has any distinguishing facial features at all, such masks are useless at hiding a person's identity. Or so one would think; such masks (think like the ones Catwoman or the Riddler wears in the 1960s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> TV show) have been successfully used to obscure people's identities at everything from masquerade balls and swinger's parties to bank robberies, even though by rights they shouldn't work. They still work today even though digital technology allows anyone with a computer and Photoshop the ability to erase the mask from any images of a person's face.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">anonymously spend an afternoon every week at Disneyland, making sure that everything was working smoothly.</a> Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">hosting a very popular TV-show</a>, all it took was an pair of sunglasses and an Hawaiian shirt to make sure that nobody recognized him.
</li><li> While filming <em>House of Wax</em> in Australia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a> had to wear a brunette wig if she went out in public to do her exercises. She wasn't recognized if the making of TV spin-off is to be believed.
</li><li> Paris was also part of a hidden camera show that explored this trope. Named <em>I Get That A Lot</em>, it would feature various celebrities in public jobs. If a customer noted their 'resemblance' to themselves, they would say "I get that a lot". Paris pretended to be a gas station attendant.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayleyAtwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayleyAtwell">Hayley Atwell</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/HayleyAtwell/status/598279129285406721">has<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/hayleyatwell/status/592480595810222081">twice<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> been in places where movies with her in them are playing. She wasn't recognized either time, and all it took was a pair of glasses.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>'s autobiography, he was able to go out in public wearing a coat, hat, and glasses and not have anyone recognize him until he took them off.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryCavill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryCavill">Henry Cavill</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rho-OdAxvV8">wandered around Times Square and wasn't recognized<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, despite there being large ads for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> in the area and the fact that he was <em>wearing a Superman shirt.</em>
<ul><li> Apparently continued to this day, where a simple handlebar mustache and a baseball cap was all Mr. Cavill needed to not be recognized at a comic book store. Only three people noticed him.
</li><li> He may have been preceded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a> in this regard, with one urban legend holding that when dressed as Clark Kent, he was ignored on the actual <em>set.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Without the trademark white-blonde wig she uses to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Daenerys Targaryen</a>, brunette <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmiliaClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmiliaClarke">Emilia Clarke</a> hardly ever gets recognized in the street. Even when she is out with other members of the cast.
<ul><li> Her go-to anecdote about this is that an adoring fan once recognized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KitHarington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KitHarington">Kit Harington</a> and pressed his companion into taking pictures of them, never realizing that it was Clarke.
</li></ul></li><li> Studies have actually shown that wearing glasses can alter one's appearance enough that people unfamiliar with the person in question have a good chance of not recognizing them, even if seeing with and without pictures side by side. So a pair of spectacles probably would be sufficient to keep the average citizen from realizing that Clark Kent is Superman wearing glasses (but it would probably not be sufficient for the people who work with him every day at the Planet).
</li><li> Marvel CEO Isaac Perlmutter, notorious for his reclusive nature, reportedly attended the premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> in disguise.
</li><li> It has been observed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZooeyDeschanel">Zooey Deschanel</a> is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ashleyperez/zooey-deschanel-is-unrecognizable-without-her-bangs">completely unrecognizable<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> without her signature bangs and glasses.
</li><li> Then there was <a class="urllink" href="http://livinghistoryofillinois.com/pdf_files/Arthur%20Novit,%20Chicago%20Police%20Officer,%20Superman%20of%20the%20Subway.pdf">Arthur Novit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a police officer in Chicago. An expert in undercover disguises, he and some fellow officers got together for a <em>special</em> sting on a robber who was rolling drunks in the subway. While one officer played the drunk, Novit waited behind a sabotaged steel door, dressed as Superman. When the moment came, he sent the door flying and arrested the robber. At trial, with Novit in his standard attire for court, the robber failed to recognize him. "Superman arrested me!" got him a trip to the court psychiatrist.
</li><li> Antony Starr said in <em>Inside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoys2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoys2019">The Boys</a></em> that people hardly recognized him as Homelander once returned to his natural brown hair and wore glasses - and adequate to a character who's a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCharacterCopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCharacterCopy">Corrupt Character Copy</a> of Superman, the others noted it was basically Clark Kent in real life. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ArMBTHZDnk&amp;feature=youtu.be">The comments of an excerpt of the show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> downright have people shocked at how just putting glasses makes Starr a totally different person!
