Sometimes an object that actually exists, or existed at one time, becomes unobtainium because it's unavailable <em>now.</em> When used in the realm of fiction, Unobtainium is usually the exotic material that is needed to make the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> of a given story work.

</p><p>The term "Unobtainium" originates from aerospace engineers in the late 1950s, where it was used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for a material sufficiently strong, light, and/or durable to meet the needs of a particular situation under discussion, even if no known material could possibly do so. It has occasionally been used in official discussions to avoid directly identifying a material whose use is still considered top secret (such as the titanium skin in the project that eventually produced the SR-71 Blackbird). Most people, however, first heard the term as the mineral sought by the mining company in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>, and mistakenly think that is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>.It was also infamously noted in The Core.

One is its ability to conduct electrical signals, useful for electrically conducting nerve impulses between an Evangelion pilot and his/her Evangelion. But more amazing is its property that it can hold vast amounts of dissolved oxygen at concentrations high enough that once it has filled the lungs, a human can directly breath the oxygen present in it (handy thing when you have to fill a bio-mecha cockpit with this stuff and have the pilot be completely submerged in it). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's actually the blood of the Angel Lilith, which adds all sorts of retroactive squick when you realize they've been "breathing" it the whole time.</span>
</li><li> Orichalcum (or a variant spelling) is a metal with magical properties that makes appearances in several anime, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> as a whole has the Chrome Digizoid metal (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">also spelled</a> ChronDigizoid). It's characterized as a highly sought after super-metal (with a silly name) of any colour which is very strong and cannot be damaged, except by other samples of it; in addition to being mined in some Digimon canons, a small number of Digimon species are either made of/plated in it (e.g. MetalEtemon) or wield weapons made of it (e.g. Zudomon, who weakened the aforementioned MetalEtemon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> with his hammer, giving the mortally-wounded SaberLeomon the opportunity to kill MetalEtemon). One time it's been referenced in the anime itself was briefly in the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> incident between Zudomon and MetalEtemon, and then only mentioned offhand to give Zudomon, a lower-level Digimon, a way to defeat MetalEtemon; as such, most mentions of the substance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">occur in the broader source material</a>. According to said source material, there exist several varieties with different properties denoted by specific colours: Blue, which provides high speed (as seen on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DigimonVTamer01" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DigimonVTamer01">UlforceV-dramon</a>); Red, which provides even higher defence (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Sleipmon</a>); Gold, which increases a Digimon's offensive power (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Shoutmon DX</a>); and the vaguely described Black (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Craniummon</a>) and Obsidian (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">KaiserLeomon</a>).
</li><li> The entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> franchise uses unobtanium to various degrees.
<ul><li> It is played straight and subverted in the very first series of all, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>. Early on the Lunar Titanium Alloy used by the RX-78 Gundam is effectively indestructible to conventional fire, the oversized machineguns and bazookas used by mobile suits shaking it, but otherwise causing very little damage. This changed near the end of the series, when Zeon mobile suits gain beam weaponry technology, and we discover that beam weaponry trumps EVERYTHING in terms of armor. For the entire Universal Century timeline afterwords, combat becomes based around <em>avoiding</em> getting hit, since any significant hit at all is instantly fatal, regardless of armor. Even the large shields mobile suits carry generally only suffer one impact before getting blown away completely. Unless the shield in question has anti-beam coating, which itself is quite rare and still doesn't provide complete protection.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> plays the trope straight, and has the alloy Gundanium, which is incredibly tough, nearly immutable, heat-resistant, electrically neutral, and a natural radar damper. The "rare, hard-to-find" part comes from the fact that it can only be manufactured in space and the fact that at the start of the show, only six people in the world know how to make it. You might be surprised to learn that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">this has some basis in real-world science</a>, as the crystalline structures that form as liquid metal solidifies can be <em>very</em> different in microgravity.

It is mined from places where there's lots of dead dragons or from a dragon that is hunted and killed. This mineral is usually pink and it directly creates electrical energy (just makes electricity out of thin air, no input required) needed to power mechs and other machinery. It also undergoes "resonance" (what seems to more accurately be nuclear fission) if too many are placed together in the same area.

<ul><li> Naturally, the setting has adamantium (in multiple flavors; see below), but it also has other "magic metals" like vibranium (of which there are two varieties, Wakandan [which absorbs kinetic energy/sound/vibrations] and Antarctic [atypically emits vibrations that cause other metals near it to liquefy]), Uru (an enchantable material, the same metal of which from Thor's hammer was forged), promethium (a magical metal found only in Otherplace/Limbo, which can be used as an energy source, despite it being a real chemical element with real properties), and netheranium (the material of Damien Hellstrom's trident). The best example, though, would have to be the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">"unstable molecules"</a> used to make so many heroes' and villains' costumes.
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s unobtainable unobtainium shield &mdash; completely indestructible, but also a handwavy one-off item. A number of stories suggest that Cap's shield is an otherwise impossible vibrainium/adamantium alloy reinforced by American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight">righteousness</a> (as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">''self''-righteousness</a>). Since the guy making it fell asleep during the forging process, we'll never know. The "vibranium/adamantium alloy" thing is due to a misprint in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OfficialHandbookOfTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OfficialHandbookOfTheMarvelUniverse">Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe</a></em> issues. His shield was made from a unique alloy of iron, Wakandan vibranium, and some unknown contaminant. When the metallurgist who had made it tried recreating the alloy (while Cap was frozen), the closest he could come up with is what's known as (true) adamantium, which is slightly <em>weaker</em> than the alloy in Cap's shield!
</li><li> Speaking of, adamantium comes in a few flavors.

There's also Secondary Adamantium, which is a lot cheaper to make but is still quite strong. Carbonadium (the stuff covering Omega Red's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">tentacles</a>) is what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietSuperscience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietSuperscience">Soviets came up with when they tried to create true adamantium</a>; it's about as strong as secondary adamantium, but is more malleable... and radioactive. Also, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a></em> universe, adamantium can block telepathy.

It turns out that they do this by mentally altering the probability of chemical reactions, such that extremely unlikely reactions occur consistently enough to form new compounds that the Earth scientists and engineers cannot replicate.
</li><li> Practically every book in the old <em>Danny Dunn</em> children's sci-fi series starts out with the discovery of a new form of Unobtainium. Usually because Danny or a friend of his spilled something in the lab.
</li><li> Tanglestone from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBear">Elizabeth Bear</a> book, <em>Undertow</em>, was only found on the planet named Greene's World, and allowed instant data and material transportation across many light years from the colonies to Earth.

Later she can make it faster by putting some in a jar and adding some of her blood to it, but she is still the only person who can make it, and thus the only one with consistent access to it.

</li><li> A few Robert Heinlein stories reference "Shipstones". These are, basically, very very very good batteries. They're not actually unobtainable, as the Shipstone Corporation will be happy to <em>lease</em> (<strong>not</strong> <em>sell</em>) you one, but good luck getting one from any other source since their method of construction is secret and disassembling one to see how it works either gets you a non-working mess (if you're lucky) or dead (they tend to explode if taken apart).

The Valyrian Freehold was able to forge a steel that was lighter but far stronger than ordinary steel. Absolutely nothing cuts like Valyrian steel; it would go through a knight in full armor like a hot knife through frozen butter. The secret of forging Valyrian steel was lost in the Doom, partially due to the fact that magic is used in its forging and magic is nigh extinct, but a handful of smiths are able to rework it. It's used by the Order of Maesters to signify mastery of the higher mysteries. Needless to say, the handful of Valyrian steel swords and daggers are thus prized heirlooms for the houses of Westeros such as Ice for House Stark (which was reforged into two for House Lannister) and Longclaw for House Mormont (which was passed on to Jon Snow of the Night's Watch).

</li><li> The iris on Earth's Stargate is made of a trinium-titanium alloy.
</li><li> Human-form Replicators apparently need neutronium (which is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutronium">a real thing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but a bit exotic in that it can only have stable existence in a neutron star).
</li><li> Also ZPMs could be seen as a sort of unobtainium given that no-one knows how to make them and they're needed to run all the Ancient technology in the series (as well as providing a convenient bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">Tim Taylor Technology</a> to the human ships).
</li></ul></li><li> The whole of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> is liberally sprinkled with various types and grades of unobtainium.
<ul><li> The original (and most frequently recurring) example is dilithium, used in the reactor core of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">warp drives</a> as a control medium because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementsDoNotWorkThatWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementsDoNotWorkThatWay">lithium's properties were well-known</a>, but there are many others.
</li><li> Corbomite, which doesn't actually exist; it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> by James T. Kirk to bluff an enemy &mdash; which means that Trek pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on their own tendency to invent vaguely-magical substances in one of its <em>earliest episodes</em>.
</li><li> Neutronium. Essentially this is used any time something's made of a material that the crew's weapons won't be able to penetrate. This is a real substance: a type of "degenerate matter" composed entirely of neutrons, thought to be what neutron stars are made of &mdash; but since even a thimbleful would weigh millions of tons, its usefulness as a material is rather limited. Astrophysicists rarely if ever use the word "neutronium" for this stuff, preferring terms like neutron-degenerate matter, and that that neutron star matter would not be stable without the extreme pressures of a neutron star in the first place anyway, i.e. it would instantly explode producing extremely intense neutron radiation.
</li><li> Duranium, Tritanium, Baakonite, and other metals used in starship construction.
</li><li> Latinum, a valuable liquid metal, used as a form of hard currency due to its rarity and the fact that replicator technology cannot recreate it.
</li><li> Trilithium, less stable than dilithium, but equally magical (and extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">explosive</a>).
</li><li> Keiyurium, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em>.
</li><li> Verterium Cortenide, a compound of <em>two</em> non-existent substances, used in the warp coils themselves.
</li><li> Archerite, another Ass Pull, this time by the Andorian Shran when explaining to another alien commander what he was doing in their territory.
</li><li> Transparent aluminum. which gets bonus points, given that a normal modern chemist could apparently figure out what it was <em>just by looking at the atomic structure</em>. Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">he would still be helpless to reproduce it without a diagram of said structure</a>. Scotty thinks the chemist was the guy who invented it in the original timeline before their time travel shenanigans, so it makes sense he would grasp it immediately.

<ul><li> Almost every race has a form of this, from the psychic wraith bone to the ubiquitous armour plate the humans use on tanks, adamantium. Adamantium's properties are never really explained, though, in the books, it seems to suffer from a mineral variation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> ("How could they cut through X many feet of adamantium that easily?"). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">technology levels</a> in the setting also cause some rather strange applications for the unobtainium, such as adamantium bayonets fitted to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">lasguns</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Imperial Guard</a>.
</li><li> When Adamantium first appeared, it could only be created in orbital plasma refineries and once set it was essentially indestructible. Plasteel was what Terminators were mostly made out of (Dreadnoughts had significant amounts of Adamantium, but most vehicles weren't made of the stuff &mdash; heck, no real mention of what material they were made out of at all. Even the Land Raiders were mostly titanium-bonded ceramite when it was first discussed what they were made out of). Once Adamantium became ubiquitous through the Imperium, that's when the stuff got Worfed.
</li><li> Another Worf Effect example is the material used in Space Marine power armour, Ceramite. Often such examples involve either cutting blades or melta/heat weapons, as ceramite is reckoned to be extremely resistant to heat. (The name, incidentally, seems to refer to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cermet">cermet<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which is a real thing.)

<ul><li> The five magical materials, Orichalcum, Moonsilver, Starmetal, some variants of Jade and Soulsteel. All of these are extremely difficult to obtain and work: Orichalcum only forms when gold touches magma and has to be worked in a lava flow while sunlight streams onto the forge, Moonsilver only forms in the Wyld, where reality is breaking down, Starmetal only comes from meteorites, which rarely fall and produce much less ore than the other materials, Soulsteel is made from ore from the Labyrinth (under the Underworld) and ghosts, Jade requires hazardous chemicals to work and is used as a currency, admittedly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZillionDollarBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZillionDollarBill">extremely high-value one</a>. There is even an Unobtainium version of Jade - in rare and unrepeatable alchemical accidents Jade (most normally a mixture of white and green Jade) can be turned into Yellow Jade which is possibly the most coveted magical material out there.
</li><li> With the release of the Alchemical sourcebook, there now exists a sixth basic magical material as well: Adamant. It is extremely rare in the main world of Creation, and only slightly more commonly found in the machine-body world of the Primordial Autochthon. To quote the sourcebook, "Adamant is composed of super-dense, electric-blue diamonds that form in yard-long rod-like masses with smaller crystals growing off larger ones. They can be found in areas that are under enormous pressure and are scorchingly hot. Mining for adamant is impossible without protective gear, even for Exalts, and special tools must be used to cut the crystalline rods free so that they can be taken back to a city and refined into useable forms." Though it is a crystal, rather than a metal or stone like the other materials, it is used in the forging of magic weapons and armor in an identical way to the others.
</li><li> Solars. One of the reasons that Solar technology is unsustainable by anybody else is due to their Wyld Shaping powers. When Solars need a material with properties relevant to the artifact or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> they are building, they just go out into the Wyld and conjure it up, regardless of how impossible its existence would otherwise be.

<ul><li> The "Perfected Metals". They have numerous extremely useful properties (perfected iron, for example, is practically indestructible, capable of cutting through <em>diamond</em> when properly sharpened, and can bend like rubber before returning to its original shape, with absolutely no metal fatigue), and can be used to create all manner of useful alloys (such as the anti-magic "thaumium"). There are only seven of them (only alchemical metals can be perfected), and it takes powerful magic to perfect them and alloy them. Perfecting is also a <em>very</em> expensive process, since it requires only naturally formed samples of metal (rather than transmuted or conjured) and only 10% of the mass yields perfected metal, with the rest being completely lost (hence, you perfect 100 grams of metal and only get 10 grams of perfected metal, with the remainder destroyed).
</li><li> <em>Apeiron</em>, a material that can only be produced by some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">archmasters</a> and appears to be some sort of Platonic ideal: it has whatever physical properties are best for the situation at hand. This is actually an example of an author being extremely informed; in a philosophical debate in ancient Greece philosophers argued over which Element was the foundation of all existence. The winner of the debate proposed 'Apeiron' over any of the traditional four elements, describing it as 'undifferentiated stuff' that could concentrate into different configurations to form anything.

<ul><li> It's implied that the mined and refined materials actually are all real-world elements and minerals. Civilization has fallen and re-built itself, so they've picked up new names and places in the technology tree. Salvaged wormhole materials are a straight example, though.

</li><li> Multiple kinds of unobtainium are mentioned in the background information of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> series:
<ul><li> An "unknown alloy" (read as: the writers couldn't think of a cool name) used to make the shields of the Hunters and the armor plating of Covenant warships.
</li><li> The impressively resistant construction material used to make the Halos and other non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> Forerunner structures, described as being incredibly dense and accurately carved to the molecule.

</li><li> Blamite, the explosive crystalline material used primarily to make Needler ammunition, which can only be found on one moon orbiting the Elite homeworld.
</li><li> The ammo for the Covenant Carbine is an unnamed toxic and radioactive compound mined from several locations within Covenant space.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Various one-off missions in the MMORPG have the player retrieve various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Mac Guffins</a>, including one actually called Inobtainium. Fittingly enough, it's an alloy of Yeahritium and Nosuchium.
</li><li> Played more straight in the game is Impervium, a metal found as a rare form of salvage (Enchanted Impervium is one of the most valuable drops), which the Vanguard soldiers are said in their profiles to be armored with.
</li><li> Orichalcum shows up too, also as a salvage material for crafting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> A recurring element in the series is a metal called "Ceratanium" (in the original Japanese, simply "Ceramic Titanium"). Its exact properties are unknown, but it seems to be involved in making all the Mega Mans' armor, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a> 4</em>, where you can collect parts and get the engineer to make body armor out of them, the Ceratanium is found once in a fixed spot each stage and goes exactly once into each piece of body armor you can make.
</li><li> There's also officially "Bassnium," the power supply Wily says he used to make Bass, which is a bit silly. In the Japanese version, it has the much less silly-sounding name "Fortenium". However, since Wily himself discovered the element while designing Bass/Forte, it's not out of character for him to give it a silly name just to match his robot.
</li><li> As well as the metal given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> "Mettanium", used to make the Met/Mettaurs/Methats that are so iconic in the series. One fan explanation for it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion">not being used in every robot Wily makes</a> is the fact that it's Unobtainium &mdash; or at least rare enough that only small objects can be created with it at a time.
</li></ul></li><li> Orichalcum, seen elsewhere in this article, also turned up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IndianaJonesAndTheFateOfAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IndianaJonesAndTheFateOfAtlantis">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</a></em> as a power source for the machines of Atlantis and potentially other machines as well. Which is why Indy had to stop the Nazis from getting to it first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Orichalcum also shows up in these various titles (usually used to make gift jewelry).
</li><li> They also feature Mystrle and Mythic Ore &mdash; used to give tools semi-magical properties.
</li><li> And plain ol' Mythril in <em>Harvest Moon</em>'s spin-off titled <em>Rune Factory</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> and its sequels feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Tiberium</a>, a plant-like but crystalline xenoforming agent (in growth patterns and behaviour &mdash; it leeches various elements out of anything it touches, and makes more of itself) but which is actually a crystalline substance of extraterrestrial origin, as a harvestable resource and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency">Global Currency</a> - it often leeches the most valuable minerals out of an area, making them <em>far</em> easier to mine than would be economically feasible. Its name derives from where it was first encountered &mdash; the impact site of the meteor that carried it to Earth at the <em>Tiber</em> River &mdash; ergo, it was called <em>Tiber</em>ium.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6fwx6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6fwx6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6fwx6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Brotherhood of Nod would like you to note that the quoted name origin was part of a faked discovery story created for anti-Nod propaganda. The true discoverer of Tiberium, the Benevolent and Mighty Kane, named the substance in honour of Tiberius Caesar, but GDI propagandists insisted on altering every detail of the story.</span> It's also terribly, terribly toxic, potentially radioactive (depending on what it leeches or assimilates), never stops growing (by the time of the second game, non-hovering watercraft are completely unusable because waterways are universally choked with Tiberium) and generally so dangerous that it explodes violently if processed improperly or stored in large enough quantities. Certain materials are more resistant to being turned into it, but all of them degrade eventually. With flesh, crystallization happens almost instantly. Nevermind the fact there's blue (canonical) and red/orange (semi-canonical) variants that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">Made of Explodium</a> &mdash; as if the green stuff didn't explode enough to begin with. With a bit of SCIENCE, you can turn tiberium (or tiberium-related substances, such as tiberium veins) into a chemical weapon that puts some of the deadliest stuff today to shame, or an explosive that makes a heavy-duty fuel air bomb look like a firecracker. Makes a lot more fictional sense if you know that C&amp;C was itself based on the RTS game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuneII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuneII">Dune II</a></em>, which had you harvesting spice out of the ground.
</li><li> Cleria, Emelas, etc. in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a></em> series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>, likewise, had "minerals" of an unspecified type and "Vespene Gas" (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas">you require more of</a>, by the way), which each of the playable races uses in a different way to produce its various units and buildings. Neosteel, the material of Terran construction, is another example. Also, the Khaydarin Crystals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM">XCOM</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first two games of the series (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">UFO</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMTerrorFromTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMTerrorFromTheDeep">TFTD</a>) have Elerium, an element that formed in yellow crystals and had an atomic number of 115. By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMApocalypse">the third game</a>, Elerium could be mined on Mars and extrasolar colonies. Elerium's in-game role was probably inspired by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.beyondweird.com/element115.html">claims<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> made about element-115 in the 1980s by a UFO enthusiast with the splendidly appropriate name of Bob Lazar. Sadly, when someone eventually got around to synthesising the stuff they called it <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium">Ununpentium<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> instead, and it also appears that Lazar was talking through his hat.
</li><li> The second game reveals that Elerium-115 becomes inert if submerged in salt-water for too long, and since the second game is subtitled <em>Terror from the Deep</em>, that's a bit of a problem. The new source of power is Zrbite - apparently, an artificial material created through molecular manipulation. Following the victory in <em>TFTD</em>, however, the aliens' Molecular Manipulation network collapses, and all remaining Zrbite becomes inert. It maintains its Unobtainium status, however, and Inert Zrbite is later used to build FTL-drive engines (with Elerium-115 as fuel).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> also features Elerium, again used as a power source. Unfortunately, you can't synthesize it, and the only way to get it is looting it off the aliens. In-game, the heads of your R&amp;D and engineering teams state that with a few years of focused research they could make both the Alien Alloys and the Elerium Generator commercially viable, but that there is no time for that big a project before the aliens are defeated.
</li><li> Elerium returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> as the ultimate and, in fact, only noteworthy power source on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">Vichy Earth</a> after 20 years of alien occupation overrode most human-made technology. Once again it can't be synthesized on Earth, but now it also comes in two forms. Elerium dust is your higher-tier acquisition resource and implied to be what powers all of XCOM's more advanced tech. Your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendInTheBlackMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendInTheBlackMarket">Friend in the Black Market</a> claims that it also makes for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">great pick-me-up</a>. Elerium cores are self-contained power sources required for the construction of the really powerful stuff, as well as some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a>. There's also mention of some unknown metals and alloys that make the Chosen weapons more powerful/efficient than what should be physically possible, but these are just flavor text without an actual impact on the story or gameplay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMChimeraSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMChimeraSquad">XCOM: Chimera Squad</a></em>: Taking place five years after 2, Elerium remains a valuable resource for both you and criminals. Although most of the aliens are now working peacefully with humanity, the implication is that it is still impossible to create on Earth, and must be salvaged from ADVENT tech.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts">Xenonauts</a></em>: Just like in <em>X-Com</em>, you can salvage the alien fuel source, Alenium, which cannot be reproduced terrestrially. Incidentally, even before attempting to use it as a power source, Xenonaut scientists decided they made for even better missile warheads, giving your interceptors an early shot in the arm in terms of firepower.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first game requires the player to collect various exotic metals and crystals such as mythril, orichalcum, lightning stones, power crystals, and serenity gems in order to create items, eventually including the most powerful weapon in the game.
</li><li> Extra points goes to Orichalcum+ in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, which not only is like Orichalcum but better, but is in so few quantities that you just barely have enough to craft the only item which requires it: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ultima Weapon</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Redstone, a nice little powder that can conduct electricity and can be used to open doors, power minecarts, make music, ect. Although it actually is very common when mining deep enough. The unminable bedrock is sometimes referred to as Unobtainium. This is probably the most accurate use of the name, since, without the use of cheats, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">cannot obtain it.</a>
</li><li> Emeralds. Although they can be traded for with villagers, trying to mine them isn't as easy. They rarely spawn and are only found in mountain biomes, scattered in random single block veins. <em>Good luck</em>. However, there are more emerald veins per chunk than diamond veins and occur at much higher levels, making them much more common in caves.
</li><li> Netherite, a fireproof material (even lava can't burn it) which allows you to upgrade your diamond gear with better efficiency, durability and enchantments. The process to obtain it is rather convoluted and tedious, as you need to go to the Nether to mine ancient debris (only found in veins of up to three, with only one or two veins per chunk, usually near the bottom and <em>never in the open air</em> &#151; meaning you can't spot them on cave walls, forcing you to dig at random and hope for the best &#151; and requiring a diamond pickaxe to mine on top of that), then smelt those into netherite scrap, of which you'll then need four, along with four gold ingots, to craft into a single netherite ingot (phew!).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has frightening amounts of Unobtainium.
<ul><li> Starting out around the time the player starts mining Mithril ore, proceeding through Truesilver, Arcanite, Fel Iron, Adamantium and finally Khorium and Eternium. To quote a recent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> post on the subject, "What's next? Awesomite?"
</li><li> There's also the equally-mundane Titanium, its enchanted cousin Titansteel, and the more fantastic Saronite. This contains or possibly is entirely the blood of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> Yog-Saron, God of Death, drives people who mine it mad, and naturally forms into the shape of skulls when smelted. And which for some inexplicable reason, people decided to make armor out of and <em>wear</em>. Yeah, sticking that on your head couldn't possibly go bad.
</li><li> <em>World of Warcraft</em> is also littered with mundanely-named minerals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementsDoNotWorkThatWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementsDoNotWorkThatWay">possess properties far greater than their real-life counterparts</a>.
</li><li> Engineers, Jewelcrafers, and Blacksmiths use Thorium (a radioactive metal used in some reactors as a replacement for uranium and of which powdered form has been known to spontaneously combust in the air... dust which would be prolific around any thorium mining, smelting or forging site... and causing liver damage if absorbed in the body pre-combustion) and later on Cobalt (which gives off toxic, arsenic containing fumes when smelted, is an active nutrient for bacteria, is the third highest rated metal for causing contact dermatitis, and can lead to cardiomyopathy or cobalt poisoning if too much is absorbed into the body from breathing or consuming cobalt dust or powder... which would be produced, as with thorium, by the mining, smelting, and forging process). And while these are real elements, the apparent ease and safety with which they can be mined, smelted, and forged adds an Unobtainium aspect to them. And we won't even start on mercury being as harmless as water in the Deepholm zone, with one quest even requiring you swim in a lake of it. Considering the average character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel">Power Level</a> is way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverNineThousand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverNineThousand">Over Nine Thousand</a> by the time they get to Deepholm, plain old mercury shouldn't be a problem.
</li><li> Dark Iron is a metal that can only be mined in a specific part of Blackrock Depths, and can only be smelted and worked on a special anvil in another specific part. Guarded by a giant fire elemental. It can be used to make rather strong armor.
</li><li> All of that aside, a plot version exists called Kaja'mite. A rare mineral only found on two islands that we know of, its presence gave the goblins super-intelligence. When supplies ran out, their intellects gradually went into decline and they spread out across the world as traders in hopes of finding new sources.
</li><li> Further expansions added obsidium, elementium, truegold, ghost iron, kyparite, trillium, living steel and lightning steel.
</li><li> Leystone is rare enough, and can only be smelted using frost magic. Demonsteel is an even rarer alloy of it that and felslate, using another specific anvil, though it is located in a friendlier location.
</li><li> Bacon could be considered this, at least the type used in Legion recipes, as you need to do a specific World Quest to hunt the Rare Mob that you get it from.

<ul><li> Element Zero or "eezo" is responsible for all of the technology in-game, as it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">the ability to manipulate mass</a>, which makes it valuable for propulsion systems, projectile weapons, kinetic force fields, artificial gravity, and a powerful, convenient method of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>.

</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividuals">Biotics</a>" are individuals who were exposed to Element Zero <em>in utero</em> and manifested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">biotic abilities</a> (the power to manipulate dark energy) as a result. Those who don't manifest are often born normally with few complications, but unfortunately there also exist some who develop fatal cancers and rarely make it to term. Other problems faced by Human biotics is that because they are still part of the first generation, many were wired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">older models</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact">Biotic amps</a> before humanity really knew what they were doing. While the L3 amps are stable, those wired with the L2 models experience some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">serious side effects</a>, everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed">nosebleeds</a>, to occasional migraine headaches, to full-on insanity.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> games has two.
<ul><li> Di-corellium, a mineral that is apparently better for use in nuclear reactors than plutonium&mdash;to the point that it almost became a metaphor for petroleum, and at the very least for energy crises in general, what with the increasing scarcity of it and power shortages on Earth because of it&mdash;and of which vast quantities, about half of all known reserves, are on the moon.
</li><li> Polonium &mdash; yes, ''<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium#Famous_poisoning_cases">that<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>' polonium &mdash; an element than in real life is unstable, highly radioactive, and extremely toxic, is used as... body armor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>:
<ul><li> The games feature Phazon, which is a highly-mutagenic, violently unstable, sentient mineral. Being a bit more specific, there is an incredibly resistant metal made from it known as Phazite.
</li><li> In addition, visor scans can identify the chemical properties of certain structures. When you see names such as "Talloric Alloy" and "Bendenzium" in the description of a destructible obstacle, it is usually an indication as to which weapon you will need to use to proceed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> has a rather extensive simulation of real-world geology and metallurgy, including creating simple alloys such as bronze and electrum.
<ul><li> It also has Adamantine, an incredibly rare ore that can be processed into various forms that allow it to be used in almost any type of construction imaginable &mdash; weapons, armour, tools, clothing, furniture, building material... about the only things you <em>can't</em> make out of it (well, without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modding</a>) are beds and food. It also happens to be both as light as styrofoam, be more resistant than any steel manageable, and being sharpenable enough that you can drop a knife on a stone floor and it'll be embedded to the hilt. Naturally, you can buy out a whole caravan with just one implement made from it. Be careful, though - if the vein is hollow, you're going to get a visit from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">the Circus</a>.

Even if you could, it's horrendously heavy (we're talking <em>core of the sun</em> heavy), so the potential uses for it are very limited &mdash; not that it matters, as the game won't let you use it even if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">somehow</a> get some out of the walls<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note74a9n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note74a9n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note74a9n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Makes for terrific catapult ammo, at least</span>.

</li><li> Now the developer is planning for game worlds to each have their own unique unobtainium with each one making some rare materials with randomly generated properties.

Primarily, there is Ebony, which here is similar to a volcanic glass (and theorized to be the petrified blood of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">dead creator god</a>). It's worth more than gold when used as bullion, can be forged into extremely high quality weapons and armor, and can be imbued with Daedric souls to create devastating Daedric weapons and armor. There is also Glass, which is an iridescent green mineral, and like Ebony, can be forged into high-quality light armor and weapons.
</li><li> Dwemer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwarven</a>) metal is an interesting case, as it's unobtainium <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>: in-game books in <em>Skyrim</em> reveal that mages, smiths, and scholars have tried for years to imitate its properties, with no success. The Dwemer were known to tinker with the laws of nature and physics, so its highly likely they applied these skills to their metallurgy. The only reliable source is recycled scrap metal from Dwemer ruins.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modding community</a> has seen fit to add dragonbone weapons as well. And Bethesda themselves later added dragonbone weapons when they released the <em>Dawnguard</em> DLC.
</li><li> The <em>Dawnguard</em> DLC also adds Aetherium as part of the "Lost to the Ages" quest. Aetherium is an incredibly rare, luminescent blue crystal found deep underground. The crystal has a strong magical aura, but it is alchemically inert and harmonically volatile, and no known conventional process can enchant, smelt, mold, bind, or break it. The Dwemer of ancient Skyrim created the Aetherium Forge to smelt the crystal under precisely controlled conditions. The quest involves locating and activating the forge, which has just enough Aetherium left to produce one item with unique abilities.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, Zexonyte, which Dr. Andonuts requires for scientific projects, is an incredibly rare material that can only be obtained from a fallen meteorite in the game's environment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombiesGardenWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombiesGardenWarfare">Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare</a></em>: The Chemist's upgrades include a chemical element called Unobtainium. And yes, it's literally called that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: Quite a few different types.
<ul><li> Gameplay-wise, any rare resource is <em>supposed</em> to be this, but it doesn't always work out that way. Control Modules, Gallium, Morphics, Neural Sensors, and Tellurium are all reasonably difficult to obtain, but blueprints don't require them in very high numbers, so the supply tends to outpace the demand. Orokin Cells, on the other hand, are required in every high-end blueprint in large quantities, making them much more valuable.
</li><li> Argon Crystals are only mildly difficult to obtain, but they have one flaw that makes them extremely frustrating: They decay outside of the Void, meaning it is impossible to stockpile them. Many high-end blueprints require Argon, requiring quick dips back in the Void for farming.
</li><li> Nitain Extract was originally only obtained from rare Alerts, and the blueprints that needed it tended to require large quantities of it. The Nightwave system changed that, as large amounts of Nitain can be bought for relatively cheap with the Nightwave credits.
</li><li> And then there are the research components: Detonite Ampules (which combine into Detonite Injectors), Fieldron Samples (which combine into Fieldron), and Mutagen Samples (which combine into Mutagen Masses). The lesser versions are uncommon drops from enemies, but converting them into the more advanced versions is expensive, so it's generally easier to run the tedious Invasion missions instead. Ironically, these are all <em>extremely</em> common in-universe; Detonite Injectors are used as ammo by Grineer, Fieldron is a basic component of Corpus energy weapons, and the Mutagen Mass is a still-living chunk of Infested flesh that produces toxins.

Both of them form the basis of Unite Morphs capable of fighting giant aliens with advanced technology.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPlanet">Lost Planet</a></em> series features a rare power source that can only be obtained by killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Akrid</a> native to the planet E.D.N.

Roy was rather unimpressed when he discovered the "vast wealth" of starmetal was a chunk smaller than his fist. Furthermore, his sword never had any starmetal in it; the whole thing was a distraction to get rid of his party for a while. However, when he finds an honest smith, she tells him that the small chunk of starmetal he found <em>is</em> immensely valuable ("Most of it tends to burn up in the atmosphere, you know") and reforges his sword with it as an alloy. Making a full sword out of the stuff would require all the known starmetal in the world, and be far too heavy to be usable. It lets his sword overcome most forms of damage reduction and occasionally releases bursts of energy that are harmful to undead and evil outsiders.

<ul><li> This is the notional material used in the manufacture of that very important tool or part which you can't seem to find anywhere. For example, at this time, 16 bit PCMCIA cards are one of many peripherals that can be said to be made of Unobtainium.
</li><li> Though never mentioned as such, a particular brand of orange wire mesh used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> was produced by a company that went out of business in the mid-1970's; a substitute had to be acquired for the filming of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS05E06TrialsAndTribbleations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS05E06TrialsAndTribbleations">Trials and Tribble-ations.</a>" This substitute mesh was correctly pointed out by episode writer David Gerrold as inaccurate to the original series.
</li><li> There are many real world examples of unobtainium, perhaps making this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. While the ideas of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mithril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mithril">Mithril</a> and Vibranium actually existing on our earth may be laughable, the idea of a mineral/resource that is near impossible to obtain is almost a historical trope.
<ul><li> When Aluminium was first discovered, it was considered unobtainium, because although it's actually the most common metallic element on Earth, it was very difficult to extract from its ores. Hence, The Washington Monument was capped with a pyramidal ingot of <em>pure aluminum</em>, Napoleon III's sets of dinnerware made from aluminum, and the statue of Anteros in London. Then Hall (and, independently, H&eacute;roult) discovered an easy way to make aluminium, and it stopped being unobtainium two years later with the construction of the first large-scale aluminum refining plant. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">You're probably drinking out of an aluminum can right now.</a>
<ul><li> Even today separating aluminum isn't as easy as you might think &mdash; it requires huge amounts of electrical power. Raw ore (bauxite) gets shipped around the world to take advantage of the cheapest possible electricity prices (Iceland smelts bauxite from South America to take advantage of its surplus geothermal power, while Quebec does the same to take advantage of its abundant hydroelectric power). It's also heavily recycled, as melting it down and re-casting it only requires 5% as much power as refining it.
</li></ul></li><li> Astatine: it was estimated that the amount of astatine in the planet barely can be gathered in a spoon, with around 30 grams existing on the entire Earth at any one time. This is because it is a product of radioactive decay, but is radioactive itself, with a half-life of 8.3 hours before decaying to lead.
<ul><li> It is also so radioactive that if you had enough astatine to be able to see it with the naked eye, you'd be dead from radiation poisoning in minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> The few who have ever attempted to make a catwhisker radio (the radio that needs no electricity whatsoever) may have found out that finding a chunk of Galena (lead sulfide) can prove to be tricky. Though the mineral is the main source of lead today, to the average hobbyist is not available. It was, however, more readily available to regular citizens in the old days due to its presence in the coal that powered the ubiquitous steam engines. Though there are workarounds, some hobbyists are willing to look around for a piece of it for an authentic galena radio.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Cold War, most of the significant titanium mines were either in the Soviet Union or elsewhere in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">Eastern Bloc</a>. As a result, Western aircraft designers often half-jokingly referred to the stuff as "unobtainium." The US was able to obtain some for its secret military projects, such as the SR-71 Blackbird, by using a long chain of middlemen buyers pretending to purchase it for other reasons. Eventually, new mines were discovered in Australia, South Africa, Canada, and Norway&mdash;all safely outside Soviet influence&mdash;and titanium stopped being unobtainium for the West. U.S. aircraft designers during this period are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>.
<ul><li> On the other hand the largest producer in the world is still in Russia. Though they now sell to everyone, and actually almost all titanium Boeing now uses is bought from them.
</li></ul></li><li> Also during the Cold War, the US Air Force had a strong desire to develop antimatter bombs, perhaps feeling that hydrogen bombs just weren't apocalyptic enough. Fortunately, there is no known natural source of antimatter and no practical way to make it that can produce the macroscopic quantities of the stuff needed for bombs, and no practical way to contain the stuff safely enough for long enough to make such a weapon useful - critically, a nuclear bomb will not explode unless you want it to, while an antimatter bomb will always try to explode whether you want it to or not.
</li><li> And yet again during the Cold War, a mythic substance known as "red mercury" was used for disinformation purposes by the Soviet Union. This substance was supposedly a high-temperature superconductor, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons, a ballotechnic and a component of certain types of stealth paint. It was apparently successfully used in a number of sting operations, since any organisation or rogue government seeking "red mercury" was clearly up to no good.
</li><li> Fortunately for those concerned about rogue states or terrorists developing nuclear weapons, the required fissionable material is this. Plutonium does not occur naturally and must be manufactured in a nuclear reactor designed for the purpose. Uranium, while it can be mined, is all but useless for fueling a nuclear reaction in its natural state and must be enriched.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11kbj3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11kbj3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11kbj3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">U-235, the isotope of uranium used in both reactors and bombs, comprises less than 1% of natural uranium; reactor fuel contains over 30% U-235 and uranium bombs over 90%.</span> The techniques involved in uranium enrichment require vast amounts of resources and specialized equipment, making it an expensive prospect for even a nation to attempt, let alone a terrorist group.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12l9i4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12l9i4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12l9i4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The plant that processed the uranium for the Hiroshima bomb was housed in a building over 1 mile in length and took up over 1.6 <em>million</em> square feet of floor space; more modern techniques involve equipment that is both sufficiently specialized that sales are highly regulated and sufficiently complex that manufacturing them requires only slightly less unobtainium-esque materials.</span>
</li><li> Wootz steel is a very specific historic case of this. It's made out of crucible-fired sand consisting of iron and tungsten carbide, which only naturally occurs in a very few places, almost all of them in central Asia. The process for making it was lost for centuries after the ore ran out, and was only rediscovered very recently through chemical analysis (the ore contained trace amounts of vanadium that created an unusual spiky crystal structure in the solidifying ingots). By all accounts, wootz steel is both stronger and more flexible than ordinary steel; back when swords were still used as weapons, Indo-Persian swords were highly valued throughout India and the Middle East because of this.
</li><li> Pandemonium Chloride is the evil, HAZMAT twin of unobtainium, a material of unspecified composition that greatly endangers human life with the smallest spills or leaks.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_trifluoride">Chlorine trifluoride<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is the real-world stuff. Derek Lowe has a nightmarish description at <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time">his blog.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> From that article: "It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is hypergolic (combusts spontaneously) with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, and asbestos, sand, and water-with which it reacts explosively."
<ul><li> There is a pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>-level rumor that the Germans produced as much as 30 tons of the stuff to use as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">an incendiary weapon</a> and rocket fuel during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">put it into the storage</a> after it became clear that the war is going nowhere &#151; and then it simply <em>disappeared</em> somewhere...
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Pandemonium</em> was in fact an early name for the transuranic metal americium, which is highly radioactive. It was called such because it was extremely difficult to separate from the element curium which was originally called <em>delirium</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire">Greek Fire</a> - Accounts say it was a combination of volatile chemicals in liquid form that, when launched, would burn on and be ignited by water. There are several possible candidates for its original formula, or possibly formulae, but the exact details are lost to history.
</li><li> Carbon nanotubes have immensely useful electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, including a strength-to-weight ratio vastly superior to any building material currently in use. Sadly, as of 2010, even poor grade nanotubes go for about $100/gram. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack">Guess that space elevator will have to wait a few more years.</a> The biggest problem with them at the moment is to avoid cumulative weakening, as at the moment the more nanotubes you stock together, the more the nanoscopic faults accumulate, until their strength is all but gone. Still, many scientists are confident that they'll have long and durable nanotube strings in a couple of years.
</li><li> Mountain biker slang for a bike made of a rare or expensive material is also 'unobtainium'.
</li><li> In the late 70's Silicon Valley, there were two popular materials for solving otherwise intractable engineering problems, very specifically: Unobtainium-12 and Expensium-6. Neither was in the Grainger's or Thomas catalog.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_element">Rare-earth elements<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are used in most modern electronics, and aren't really rare, but they are hard to find in an economically-usable state. And, in addition, 97% of rare-earth mining is done in China. Because of their usefulness, worries that the Chinese could cut off or severely reduce exports of it is enough that now others countries are looking into reopening mines almost solely so that the Chinese cannot make unobtainium of them. One of the main hurdles is that mining and processing them creates a <em>staggering</em> amount of toxic waste.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> racer Junior Johnson had a friend in the aerospace industry who wanted him to try out a brand new material they'd cooked up: carbon fiber. Johnson sent him a pair of control arms to be copied in the material, and was astounded that they weighed less than a single steel arm. Since he was the only person with access to it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">there were no rules preventing him from replacing as many parts as he liked with CF</a>. The racing body only took notice of these parts when they were worried that his carbon brakes, visibly glowing from heat, might cause a tire fire.
<ul><li> Needless to say, carbon fiber is now commonly used in both Formula 1 cars and many high-end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">exotic cars</a>, starting with the 1994 McLaren F1.
</li></ul></li><li> Nuclear physics has created Exotic Matter in exceedingly minute quantities. Synthetic baryons (baryons are particles such as protons and neutrons) contain configurations other than the standard two up/one down, one up/two down, quark arrangements. Theoretically such femtotechnology could lead to a dazzling array of alternate chemistries. Thousands of alternate periodic tables may be possible, maybe more.
<ul><li> The synthetic baryons all decay rapidly (the order of 10^-10 sec or shorter halflifes). The chemistry of an atom is determined by the electrons surrounding the nucleus. Atoms with synthetic baryons would be considered different isotopes of the same element.
</li><li> Recently a Japanese team reported the discovery of a so-called tetraquark &#151; an exotic baryon consisting of four quarks instead of a normal three. Despite being roughly equally important to modern particle physics, the news were drowned by the buzz of a Higgs boson discovery, which has much better publicity.
</li></ul></li><li> The platinoid metal <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhenium">rhenium<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has all types of possible uses, mainly because it gives nearly magical properties to the metals it is alloyed with. Unfortunately, it is so incredibly rare and expensive that it's used mainly in aircraft engines, where its cost can be justified. (Not coincidentally, it was the very last of the stable elements to be discovered, in 1925.) There is <em>one single</em> concentrated deposit of rhenium on the whole planet, discharging as a sulfide gas from a single fumarole on the side of a volcano on the South Kurile island of Iturup, which is disputed between Russia and Japan. It is possible that the harder position Russia has recently taken about the Kurile issue might be explained by the wish to protect and exploit this deposit.
</li><li> Wood for shipbuilding was an Unobtanium for Venice and for England and other similar naval empires. Not just any wood but the right kind of wood for the right jobs. Trees that had longer trunks, for instance, received favor, for their utility in building certain long parts of ships; oak was favored for many purposes&mdash;especially for warships&mdash;because it is sturdier (with live oak from the American South being particularly prized); trees with tall, straight trunks were needed to build masts; and pine was needed to produce pitch and tar, needed for waterproofing and other purposes (e.g. preventing <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipworm">shipworm<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from afflicting their vessels). Hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">Wooden Ships and Iron Men</a>. This could often be an element and not always a positive one in the relations between Britain and America and Scandinavian countries, both of which were among the main suppliers. The loss of the American supply of timber, pitch, and tar for the Royal Navy was actually a key catalyst for the Industrial Revolution; the search for a source of pitch led a particularly hapless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">poor Scottish earl</a> to develop processes to efficiently produce coal tar, which directly led to the first gas lighting (and therefore the 24-hour factory and shift work) and indirectly led to the modern chemical industry.
<ul><li> Earlier the English were responsible for converting yew into the wooden Unobtanium du jour due to their legendary enthusiasm for longbows. While yew trees were common throughout Europe, good knot-free lengths suitable for bowmaking were rare. By the 15th century the English had instituted an import fee payable in yew staves on every ship coming into the country, and forests as far away as Austria were being pillaged for yew. Only the introduction of guns put a stop to the demand.
</li></ul></li><li> Petroleum. Oil is needed to power a vast variety of modern-day vehicles, and without it, they would not function. It is worth tons of money, and those who extract and sell it have become world leaders.
<ul><li> There's an often overlooked significance to petroleum. Beyond its primary role as an energy resource (which has plenty of substitutes), the waste product of petroleum processing is *sulphur* - heavily used in industry, agriculture and medicine. Petroleum made sulphur cheap. It would be easy to ration fuel for tractors in an emergency - but without the sulphur, we'd lose fertilizers.
</li><li> It's also the main source of lubricants and the only source for chemicals needed to produce everything from plastic to synthetic rubber.
</li></ul></li><li> Amateur chemist Maurice Ward claimed to have invented a material called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlite">Starlite<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a largely organic compound which could withstand and insulate against incredible amounts of heat. In one live demonstration, an egg coated in the stuff was exposed to blowtorch flame for five minutes- after which the egg remained uncooked and cool enough to handle without protection. Despite allowing various scientific bodies to run tests on the material, Maurice kept the manufacturing process a closely guarded secret. He died in 2011, taking the secret formula with him, and leaving only a limited quantity of extant Starlite.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.starlitethermashield.com/">ThermaShield<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> now claims to have obtained the formula from Maurice's family, and seems to have replicated the results.
