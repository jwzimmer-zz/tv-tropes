</p><p>The age difference usually causes some raised eyebrows or disapproving comments from other characters in the story, like these: "He's old enough to be your father!" &mdash; "You could be his mother or much... much older sister."
</p><p>The age gap is often presented in the work as an obstacle that the couple must overcome as they might be judged by others. Some characters can assume that the younger one is only in it for the money or nice gifts, or that the older one only wants to score a hot piece of ass and is not interested in anything else. And it often can be precisely the case.
</p><p>The age gap is often not significant because of the specific number of years, but because of how the disparity in age is relative to each other in the couple. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapAlgebra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapAlgebra">As a general rule, when an older character is dating a character less than two-thirds of their age, it becomes notable; for example, 9 and 14 is notable, 19 and 24 not so much; 18 and 30 is notable, 38 and 50 again not so much</a>. Naturally, this means that as the characters grow older, their age gap becomes less and less significant. Generally, the man is the older one and the woman is the younger one, though it can be reversed as well. When the woman is older, she may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrsRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrsRobinson">Mrs. Robinson</a>. As a general rule, the difference should be noted <em>in-universe</em> as unusual. It may often overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalPairing">Unequal Pairing</a> if the age difference overlaps with a difference in authority/status as well.

Actually, before women became a major force in the job market and romance became a major part of marriage and courtship in the 1920s, the average age for a bride was about 17-18 due to high infant mortality rates requiring a longer window for women to be pregnant. Men would also try to ensure their economic security before starting a family, a longer process back in the 19th/early 20th centuries. Thus, ten to fifteen years' difference between man and wife was considered quite normal.

Dany, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">only views him as a friend</a>.

However, neither of them are happy about it and he ultimately refuses to consummate the marriage because she's just a child. In the TV show, the gap is even more significant despite Sansa being aged up to fourteen, as Tyrion is also aged up to about forty.

<ul><li> The Spanish songwriter Jose Jose has a song called "Cuarenta y Veinte" ("Forty and twenty"). The song is about the protagonist who is in his 40s and has fallen in love with a young twenty-something girl, and it deals with the obstacles the couple has to face, including other people's disapproving comments.
<div class="indent"><em>"Cuarenta y veinte, cuarenta y veinte. Es el amor lo que importa y no lo que diga la gente. <br>Forty and twenty, forty and twenty. It's the love that matters and not what people say."</em>

The song tells a story of a guy (and a friend of the narrator) that likes to date young girls in high school, but this guy is implied to be over thirty. The chorus has various local expressions about these relationships, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a> "profanador de cunas".
</li><li> "Hey Nineteen" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a> is about a middle-aged man's disappointment with a young lover. There is not so much of an age difference &mdash; at most, the man is in his early 30s going by the lyrics as well as the song creator's age at the time. But the generation born about 1950, give or take a couple of years, had a hugely different world to deal with in their coming-of-age compared to that of those born about 1960.
</li><li> "Our Ages or Our Hearts" by Roberta Flack is about a woman in a relationship with someone much older (or younger) than her. This age gap is large enough to be deemed inappropriate by society, but the woman doesn't care. She asks her lover if they will stay with her or leave her due to judgment from others and the pressure of societal norms.
