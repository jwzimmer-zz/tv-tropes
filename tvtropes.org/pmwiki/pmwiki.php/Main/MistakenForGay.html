</p><p>A comedy plot line in which a character wrongly believes another character to be gay, either because of misinformation received or because of the supposedly gay character's own misinterpreted words and actions. Once the character is taken to be a homosexual, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeIsCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeIsCompany">all his words and actions become laden with innuendo</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper">further misunderstandings</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerPeopleAreFunny">humor</a> ensues.
</p><p>This can often be caused with supernatural secrets, such as superpowers or lycanthropy, which aren't immediately obvious, or various other embarrassing secrets.
</p><p>Almost inevitable for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>. This plot may be the first time we've heard them explicitly say they're <em>not</em> gay (whether we believe them or not is another matter).
</p><p>A slight subversion occurs when a character is suspected of being gay and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">takes this as a compliment</a>, since that person deeply sympathizes with gay people.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>For such characters to qualify, they have to be mistakenly assumed to be homosexual, even if the G, H, and L words are not used. However, these characters don't need to retaliate or tell those who have mistaken them that they aren't gay as such characters can easily disprove these mistake through other means such as a revelation of a straight relationship.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForIndex">Mistaken for Index</a>.

When the Character is heterosexual but acts like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> stereotype they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">Camp Straight</a>. Due to the common belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">All Men Are Perverts</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AManIsAlwaysEager">A Man Is Always Eager</a>, any male character who isn't shown to jump at the chance to have sex with a woman <em>will</em> be mistaken for gay (if not actually gay) by the audience and possibly by the other characters as well (especially male characters). This trope, when used is considered a use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> because it is a trope concerning homosexual themes.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RawhideKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RawhideKid">Rawhide Kid</a>: The Sensational Seven</em>, the openly gay Rawhide Kid figures his compatriot the Two-Gun Kid for gay based on his costume &mdash; stuff like the kerchief, the mask, the print on the vest. When they talk about it, Two-Gun is mortified and says he has to rethink his look, but Rawhide encourages him to keep it the same, saying that being tough is about standing your ground, being true to yourself, and not caring about what other people think.

Dave goes along with it for a while since his crush, Katie Deauxma, adopts him as a gay best friend. The situation does not end well. After acting the part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBestFriend">Gay Best Friend</a> (including spray tanning her topless), he admits it was all a ruse.

Then later she finds them yelling at each other in what looks like a lover's quarrel. Things like this continue to happen, freaking her out more and more.

This is intentional; the photo is sent by his neighbor in an attempt to use discrimination fears to avoid the impending layoff of the main character.

At the end of the film, he is reunited with his girlfriend who turns out to be both real and highly attractive (and also apparently every bit as bubble-headed as he is), while the rest of the characters express their surprise.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue">Clue</a></em> features Mr. Green, whose blackmail-worthy secret is that he's gay.

Since the movie was made in 1940, they had to do the whole mistaken for gay subplot without ever saying the word "gay" or "homosexual" (in fact, they had to make do without any direct reference to sex of any kind). It's still surprisingly clear, especially when a therapist the (second) wife hired apparently finds Nick trying on a dress.
</li><li> This didn't seem to affect them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringingUpBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringingUpBaby">Bringing Up Baby</a></em>, when Grant goes to the door in Katie Hepburn's dressing gown because there's nothing else to wear, the dignified lady caller wants to know what he's doing in that getup; Grant jumps up in the air, waving his arms, and yells "Because <em>I just went GAY all of a sudden!</em>" While film studios at this time <a class="urllink" href="http://trueclassics.net/2011/06/27/he-just-went-gay-all-of-a-sudden/">usually got away with having flaming gay characters by contextualizing them<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as "mistaken for gay" or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>-like refined but straight males, in this case and a few others MGM got away with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>.

During a later conversation with one of the townspeople, Bernie asks if it's possible for someone to snap under duress and do something terrible that they couldn't possibly have done under normal circumstances. He's covertly referring to killing Marjorie, but the woman he's talking to thinks he's trying to confess to being gay.

Once he finally manages to work around to saying what he thought, Alexis bursts out laughing and explains that no, both of them are straight and they only slept in the same bed because installing a second bunk in the captain's quarters wasn't practical for either of them (Marie had to be able to get up in the middle of the night to deal with her baby, and Alexis is too short to comfortably climb to an upper bunk).

While checking a booth the father is startled when a woman asks if he is looking for a naughty little girl. Flustered the father replies, "No! I'm looking for a naughty little boy!"

</div></li><li> Folk singer-songwriter Fred Small made a point of avoiding any references to gender in his lovesongs, so that listeners could interpret them as being about a person of any gender they liked. This, plus a number of overtly pro-gay rights songs, led to a lot of speculation among fans that Small was gay, and he studiously avoided confirming or denying it. He "came out" as straight in 1993, in response to the wave of homophobia over the issue of gays in the military, because he felt it was important that straight allies make themselves known. (His last album does contain one song, "Reverie's End," in which his lost love is definitely a woman because he recalls imagining she was pregnant.)

</li><li> Hal got close to a squished Jeff so he can mourn for him. Jeff got revived and thought Hal was gay. When Hal spoke later in the episode, Jeff said "Shut up, gay face!"

<ul><li> Hal was apparently leaving during his jobless period. A Mouser came by and took the sack he was carrying. Hal notices this, and said "He took my sack!". Kamek heard him and said "What are you, gay?!"

<ul><li> Not as close to the trope itself, but when Jeff and Hal (disguised as Mario and Luigi, respectively) were making there way inside Peach's palace, the Toad there said hi to them (he mistook them for Mario and Luigi), and blushed when he said hi to Hal (Luigi), and said "Ya know, I had a great time last night." Hal then asked "Are you insinuating that I'm a gay?"

Later, upon witnessing one of the consequences of that friendship, the girl's reaction was basically "I can't picture this happening unless these two slept together at some point."</span>.

Tweek and Craig fail to get people to stop shipping them together and they decide to go along with it after seeing how happy their "relationship" makes everybody. Interestingly, this actually ends up developing into a <em>real</em> gay relationship, as cemented in "Put it Down" two seasons later, where Craig calls Tweek "babe" and "honey" even when there is nobody they know around and thus no need to hold up a charade.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KTTunstall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KTTunstall">KT Tunstall</a> was mistaken for gay after her Eye To The Telescope album; many of the songs are ambiguous in this regard, and the cover art depicts her wearing a pair of rainbow suspenders.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qm5m');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3qm5m" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qm5m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> "suspenders" here is American English for <em>"braces"</em>, not "lingerie". Here she's actually in a man's shirt with braces, not the sort of suspenders a woman wears below the waist.</span> Despite her statements to the contrary, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">many people think she's just in the closet.</a>
<ul><li> This perception of KT wasn't helped when she posed for a photoset with fellow singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JossStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JossStone">Joss Stone</a>. Somehow Joss appeared ultra-feminine; Tunstall somewhat butch and mannish in mens'-style clothing. <em>Possibly</em> completely accidentally, <a class="urllink" href="https://sites.create-cdn.net/siteimages/5/5/8/55872/73/4/4/734414/278x368.jpg?1">the result<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> looked like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">butch</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickLesbian">femme</a> partnership and fuelled rumours that both heterosexual singers were in a relationship - with each other.
</li></ul></li><li> Around the time that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MelanieC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MelanieC">Melanie C</a>, formerly of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpiceGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SpiceGirls">Spice Girls</a>, put her first solo album out, her stylists started putting her in some very soft-butch clothing for record art and press photoshoots, and even threw in some rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a>-loaded poses with female models. This naturally led to an awful lot of prurient tabloid speculation, which made a definite contribution to her unhappy mental state at the time.
</li><li> Former astronaut Michael Collins references this trope in his memoir <em>Carrying The Fire</em> when he describes how NASA started having simultaneous sleep periods for astronauts after Gemini 5; he says they had to be careful about the terminology because someone might misunderstand if they heard that a crew was "sleeping together."
</li><li> Musician Billy Squier's 1984 video for "Rock Me Tonite", directed by Kenny Ortega, featured him waking up from a bed with satiny pastel sheets and dancing effeminately around the room in a pink tank top (not quite the concept he had told Ortega he wanted to do). While the song was his most successful single ever, it was also his <em>last</em> hit single. Everyone thought he was gay, he could no longer sell out concerts, and the video is widely considered one of the worst ever since it ruined his career.
</li><li> Because of his overall looks and flamboyant personality, singer Mika was thought to be so. He later put the rumors to rest stating he's not straight, but then again he's not gay nor bisexual either (His declarations seem to place him somewhere among the lines of either polysexual or pansexual with the typical "no labels" argument). Later on, in August 2012, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">he came out as gay</a>.
</li><li> Seattle actor Jeremy Adams, who played a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> character in Mark Siano's cabaret show <em>Modern Luv</em>, is heterosexual in the real world.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Bert and Ernie</a>. On the one hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> may never have been ignored so much. On the other hand, all those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingInBed">Talking in Bed</a> sketches only hurt their case. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SesameWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SesameWorkshop">Sesame Workshop</a>'s official line has for years been "They are not gay, they are not straight, they are puppets. They don't exist below the waist."
</li><li> Being an unmarried politician over the age of thirty usually leads to automatic gay rumors. US Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is a commonly cited example, one of the few bachelors to pursue the presidency, and has frequently denied being gay. A friend and fellow Air Force officer was interviewed about this and stated Graham is "Nothing but heterosexual. There are stories that I cannot share to prove it but he is."
<ul><li> This was more of an issue in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, where being gay was at first illegal <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4vgwr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4vgwr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4vgwr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it was only taken off the British statute books as a crime in 1967</span> and then socially unrespectable. British politicians of the era who <em>were</em> gay tended to benefit from the sympathies and covert understanding of their fellows; political luminaries of the time, such as Lord George Brown (Labour), Jeremy Thorpe (Liberal) and one Prime Minister, Edward Heath (Conservative), were simply described using ambiguous terms such as "confirmed bachelor" and their gayness was accepted by the Establishment, which closed ranks around them.
</li></ul></li><li> Jonathan Davis, lead singer of the rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn">Korn</a> had this problem early in the band's career, because of his flamboyant way of dressing during concerts, including wearing dresses. The band even had fun with this belief by making a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OV-3Tgr3lc">troll conspiracy video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. However, Johnathan is married with children, and he had a reputation with female groupies beforehand. Clearly, this has been a problem for him going as far back as highschool, if the song "Faget" is any indication. "I'm just a pretty boy. I'm not supposed to fuck a girl."
</li><li> Glenn Erickson, author of the DVD Savant film column, once <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s665hour.html">shared an anecdote<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that while attending UCLA, he started receiving mail praising his stand on gay rights. Turns out another Glenn Erickson, a member of the Gay Student Union, had written such an article for <em>The Daily Bruin</em>. Erickson considered writing a clarification, but decided he'd rather be mistaken for gay than mistaken for a homophobe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> got hit with this in the late '90s. He recounted that some of his mother's friends told her "Well, he's almost forty, and he's not married, and he lives in Hollywood. You <em>know</em> what that means."
</li><li> During the 2015 Academy Awards, Graham Moore, the winner of Best Adapted Screenplay for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheImitationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheImitationGame">The Imitation Game</a></em>, stated in his speech, "When I was sixteen years old, I tried to kill myself because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong." Given the film he'd written was about a closeted gay man who was driven to suicide by his orientation, many news outlets interpreted it as him coming out as gay. He later clarified that he is straight.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, "The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Cute</a> Beatle", was subjected to some of this in the early 1960s - a time when it was potentially a very damaging rumor. Most famously, Tony Sheridan - a singer that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> recorded with before getting famous - assumed he was gay because of his well-shaped eyebrows. He figured that no straight guy had eyebrows like that. Notably, to this day, some people believe that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">had an affair with John Lennon</a>, despite his consistent denials.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzFerdinand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzFerdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a> have spent their whole career having to point out that none of them are actually gay or bisexual, due to the very blunt and convincing male-homoerotic lyrics of "Michael" on their first album (they now claim that it was meant to be a tribute to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a>' more homoerotic material).
</li><li> During Operation Julie, a drug investigation by UK police in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, a group of undercover officers on surveillance risked attracting hostile local attention when they were assumed to be members of a 'gay cult'. So several female officers where brought in, including one Sgt Julie Taylor whose name was eventually given to the operation.
</li><li> A fatal example of this trope happened with <a class="urllink" href="http://murderpedia.org/female.W/w/wright-daphne.htm">Daphne Wright<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who murdered Darlene VanderGiesen because she was convinced VanderGiesen was trying to start a relationship with her ex-girlfriend. VanderGiesen was in fact straight and she and Wright's ex were just good friends. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles">Forensic Files</a></em> episode "Hear No Evil" covered it.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cristianosgays.com/2017/10/30/una-joven-chilena-es-victima-de-lesbofobia-por-subir-una-fotografia-con-su-madre-a-facebook/">A mother and daughter uploaded a photo to Facebook <img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (link in Spanish) and received a very offensive comment calling them "disgusting lesbians." They responded very elegantly making it clear that a stupid fanatic like that did not deserve his attention.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter">Blue Peter</a></em> presenter Valerie Singleton, (in 2018, now 81 years old) has said that she was utterly frustrated that the rumour about her being lesbian took such deep root that it could never be properly denied, and said living with it for thirty-odd years got pretty hard. She points out that during her time on the show, the love affairs she <em>really</em> wanted to keep secret were with star radio DJ Pete Murray and her co-star Peter Purvis. Fortunately, the assumption she was gay prevented intrusive people from looking any further. Val was also - erroneously - reported in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">British Newspapers</a> to be having an affair with singer <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanArmatrading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanArmatrading">Joan Armatrading</a>.
