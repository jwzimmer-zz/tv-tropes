</p><p>While it may have worked in the days when guns were extremely underpowered (relatively speaking), these days the life-saved-by-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacGuffin">sentimental-object</a> trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">discredited</a>; it's rare to find a 21st century example that plays it straight. It's important to note that most real-world examples involve ricochets, spent bullets, shrapnel or other low-velocity projectiles. It's a very lucky break when the round is moving slow enough to be stopped by anything so small and thin as what you can fit in a pocket. Also, pretty much any real-life example of a bullet being stopped by a Bible or other book in the victim's pocket will involve the book being stored in a silver or steel box, which obviously provides more resistance than just paper.

Romio's brother Airu, the one who accused them in the first place, doesn't buy the farce, until the two threaten to (really go for) literally aim for their necks. Airu had to step in before the swords connect lest the two kill each other. What's another secret to everybody was that Juliet sent Romio a sign to aim for the rosary he gave her (and vice-versa), which were the ones who actually took the hit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Change123" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Change123">Change 123</a></em> a bullet shot into the back of a girl gets stopped by a (hidden) combat knife tucked into her belt.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Suzaku is shot in the back; in the second, we learn that the bullet hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MementoMacGuffin">a pocket watch</a> that belonged to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>. Unlike many examples, the bullet still injures him even if it's not fatal. Note also that Code Geass uses something that's basically low velocity railguns instead of actual gunpowder guns. Bullet weight and speed are significantly lower then in the real life.
</li><li> Played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em>.

When a shocked Ange asks how the hell she survived, Momoka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriasSecretCompartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriasSecretCompartment">reaches into her blouse</a> and pulls out a cast-iron frying pan with a bullet in it. No that <em>doesn't</em> explain how she survived everything else(or <em>why</em> she's carrying a frying pan, or how the hell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">it fit in there</a>), that's the joke.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> uses the trope once in a while:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A mahjong tile in Takagi's breast pocket (taken as evidence) stops a bullet. Shiratori even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshade">lampshades</a> how cliche it is. OTOH, Takagi <em>did</em> get injured anyway (due to quite the blunt trauma force to the chest) and had to be hospitalized and operated on.</span>
</li><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> once Conan almost gets stabbed in the gut by a suspect. He had an amulet with a piece of metal in his pocket (which he borrowed from Heiji), which stopped the knife. He still is in pain for a while and needed to rest up.</span>
</li><li> And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Megure's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> softens a blow to the head given to him with a metal pipe. It's not enough to avert the hospital trip, however.</span>
</li><li> In one episode, a boy's life is saved because a knife hit a hat that he had inside his jacket. The hat had been a gift from is late mother and he always had it with him.
</li><li> In another case, a woman (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Sato</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble">while in a disguise</a></span>) gets stabbed when she's wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairytaleWeddingDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairytaleWeddingDress">Fairytale Wedding Dress</a>. The dress itself has a <strong>very</strong> thick corset so it stops the knife in itself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilMayCryTheAnimatedSeries">Devil May Cry: The Animated Series</a></em>, Dante gets possessed by a cursed pocket watch he was wearing as a necklace. Lady shoots him and he falls, but when the demon who set this up shows up to gloat, Dante gets up and reveals Lady's bullet destroyed the pocket watch and snapped him out of it. Slightly subverted because Dante points out the bullet actually penetrated the pocket watch and hit his heart anyway, but the bullet was slowed down enough that it just bruised his heart (which really hurt) instead of penetrating it. A simple matter for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> to fix.

<ul><li> They tested normal everyday items like a book, a deck of cards, and a Zippo lighter and showed that they were all ineffective at stopping bullets. They also tested police/sheriff badges (outcome depends on how the badge is made &mdash; they put holes in two test badges, but the third type stopped a handgun round). In another episode, they tried the same with knives. A book, or a thick pile of paper (e.g. money), can save you. It takes about 60 or so sheets thick to stop the hardest hit the build team managed.
</li><li> In an episode regarding myths from the American Civil War, they showed it was plausible for a silver dollar of the time to stop a bullet. A pocket Bible, not so much.
</li><li> In another episode, they tested urban legends involving stories of items that stopped bullets. A laptop computer wouldn't, unless the bullet hit the battery. A hair weave didn't even slow the thing down; if that story was close to true, the bullet probably ricocheted around inside the woman's car and then got caught in the weave once it was too slow to be dangerous. Three pepperoni pizzas in a deliveryman's warming bag blocked <em>most</em> of the pellets from a shotgun firing birdshot, so you might survive (as was claimed by a pizza delivery boy). Buckshot at the same range, however, required 14 pizzas distributed between 5 warming bags before they could be stopped.
</li><li> During a final season revisit, Jamie and Adam took a second look at "Zippo lighter stops a bullet". While a bullet fired straight at the lighter went straight through, a ricocheted shot only dented it, earning Zippos a "Plausible".

Upon Demona's departure, Elisa opens her jacket to reveal that her police badge stopped the dart. Goliath <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapIsTheOnlyOption">still shows up for the challenge</a>, because Elisa would just be targeted again if he doesn't. As it is, it probably takes a while for Demona to realize she is still alive.
</li><li> In the Danish CGI movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JourneyToSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JourneyToSaturn">Journey to Saturn</a></em>, the Iranian-Danish Jamil Ahmadinejad carries a huge collection of photos of his extended family under his shirt. Enough to subvert an impending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackDudeDiesFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackDudeDiesFirst">Middle-Eastern Dude Dies First</a> moment.
</li><li> In the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePiratesOfDarkWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePiratesOfDarkWater">The Pirates of Dark Water</a></em>, Atani archers shoot at the Wraith, and Ioz apparently gets hit in the chest. It turns out that he had a golden goblet&#151;the theft of which was one of the reasons the Atani were chasing them in the first place&#151;hidden under his robe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a 1940s-era cartoon, Bluto pretended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> in order to woo Olive Oyl. Popeye and "Superman" have a one-upsmanship contest culminating in shooting each other with a Thompson sub-machine gun. Popeye is left for dead, then slowly gets to his feet, reaches into his sailor suit, and pulls out the can of spinach that has been in front of his chest, now riddled with bullet holes. He gives a Popeye chuckle, and says, "Saved by me spinach!"
</li><li> Also in one episode, at the losing end of a fencing duel against Bluto, disguised as the International, Popeye is saved from a finishing thrust by none other than a can of spinach hidden in his shirt.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, a mobster accidentally shoots Ned Flanders in the chest. The bullet hits his Bible. The mobster shoots <em>again</em>, only to hit a piece of the True Cross he wears around his neck. Ned then flees before any more shots are fired, presumably because he realizes he's run out of religious objects.
</li><li> Parodied again in an episode when Homer is hit by a car &mdash; but is saved by the Bible in his crotch.
</li><li> This happens in another episode where Apu is shot in a Kwik-E-Mart robbery, with the bullet bouncing off another bullet that was previously lodged in him in a different robbery.
</li><li> In another episode, "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution", Bart accidentally fires a gun and the bullet fails to wound Homer because it is stopped by another gun Homer happens to have in his back pocket.

<ul><li> Bibles:
<ul><li> London's Imperial War Museum has a pile of dummies showing off different nationalities' uniforms during the two world wars. The British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> soldier showcases a pocket Bible ... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">with the bottom right quarter blown off</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">and the rest drowned in blood...</a>
</li><li> Many of the pocket Bibles carried by soldiers in World War II had metal-backed covers. As a consequence, even Jews, Atheists, and other non-Christians would carry them, as they did have the potential to stop a bullet. Many of the stories of Bibles stopping bullets come from this era, though with the storyteller <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipEvolution">forgetting to mention the composition of the cover</a>.
</li><li> One bullet was documented to have stopped at the 91st Psalm ("...You need not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day... though thousands fall about you and ten thousand fall at your right hand, near you it shall not come....").
</li></ul></li><li> Badges worn by police officers have been proven to be able to stop small arms fire: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wral.com/news/national_world/national/story/7034990/">Here's a story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of a cop saved by his badge. Proven true by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> above, though it depends on the materials used to make the badge. The YouTube channel TAOFLEDERMAUS <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdl4EKc9jrA">also tested this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and, so long as they actually <em>hit</em> the thing dead-on, were able to get a single badge to consistently stop multiple different types of handgun bullets with no damage to it that couldn't be undone with ten seconds of hammering it back into shape.
</li><li> An man named John Schrank shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> in 1912, angered by his decision to run for a third term. Fortunately, the bullet was prevented from penetrating too deeply by several layers of clothing, a steel eyeglass case and a massive folded speech in his jacket. The bullet penetrated him anyway and hit a rib, but since he wasn't coughing up any blood, he gave his 90-minute speech from memory anyway (the speech papers were ruined) before seeking treatment. He famously began his speech, "Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose!" He even went as far as to briefly confront Schrank moments after he had shot him.
</li><li> A US soldier stationed in Iraq was wounded in a fire fight only to find out later that an ammo round had embedded itself in the copy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Eye of the World</a></em> (which is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">685 pages long</a> depending on the version) he happened to be carrying in his pack, rather than embedding in his side.
</li><li> Another US soldier in Iraq was shot point-blank in the face by an insurgent, only realizing it later when the X-rays showed that the bullet had deflected off of one of his front teeth (knocking the tooth out) and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/military/teeth.asp">lodging in his upper jaw.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> In addition to killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators were going to kill the bedridden Secretary of State, William Seward. Secretary Seward's jaw had a large splint on it at the time from an accident, and it allegedly saved his life by keeping his knife-wielding assassin from being able to hit him in the jugular, though he did suffer very serious wounds.
</li><li> The Australian War Memorial has a collection of such items that have saved the lives of Australian servicemen.
</li><li> Lt. George E. Dixon of the American Civil War submarine <em>H. L. Hunley</em> carried a gold coin that his sweetheart gave to him as a good luck charm, which later deflected a bullet at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 (not much it could do to save him from going down with the <em>Hunley</em> two years later, though). There were accusations that this was just a romantic story without basis in reality - but then in the year 2000, 136 years after it sank, the wreck of the <em>Hunley</em> was pulled out, containing the deteriorated, skeletal remains of her crew. On the remains identified as Dixon, <em>they found his bent coin</em>. Removing any doubt that it was just some other bent coin, Dixon apparently had it engraved after the bullet bent it, and the words were still legible: "Shiloh / April 6, 1862 / My life Preserver / G. E. D."
</li><li> A clerk in a grocery store being robbed was holding a box of Hamburger Helper when the robber shot him. The bullet did hit the poor guy, but the Hamburger Helper slowed the bullet down enough that it barely penetrated his skin, whereas it otherwise would have been a fatal shot.
</li><li> A man out mowing his lawn in backwoods Missouri was saved from a stray hunting bullet by his cellphone. The phone still works.
</li><li> In early 2009, a gun-wielding madman burst into a church in the American state of Illinois. The first few shots that he fired at the pastor were absorbed by the Bible that he was holding. Unfortunately, there were more bullets.
</li><li> An Iraqi woman apparently survived what would otherwise have been a potentially fatal gunshot wound when the bullet lodged in her silicone breast implant.
</li><li> This trope is explored at <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot31.htm">the Box o' Truth,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> where the site owner empties a lot of bullets into a stack of books.
</li><li> Behold the power of the brassiere. An older woman happened to be seen by fleeing burglars who had tried to break into the neighbor's house. One of them fired a round through her window, but the bullet was <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090423/ap_on_fe_st/odd_bullet_stopping_bra">deflected by the underwire of her bra.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDoohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDoohan">James Doohan</a> was hit by a burst of friendly fire during World War II, taking six bullets total. One of the bullets took off a finger. Another one struck him in the chest near his heart, where it was stopped by his silver cigarette case that was given to him by his brother.
</li><li> Rudyard Kipling was sent a copy of his book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Kim">Kim</a></em> (368 pages), complete with bullet hole stopping only at the last 20 pages, together with the Cross awarded to the soldier who owned it. He later became said soldier's son's godfather.
</li><li> When author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeHaldeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeHaldeman">Joe Haldeman</a> was serving in Vietnam he knew a soldier whose life was saved by a pocket dictionary that stopped a bullet. Later Haldeman saw that the story had been written up in <em>Stars and Stripes</em> (a newspaper that serves the U.S. Armed Forces). In the story,, the dictionary had been changed to a Bible, and it was claimed that the word the bullet had stopped on was "peace."
</li><li> Mustafa Kemal, the founder of modern Turkey who is now better known as Ataturk, was saved by one of these during World War I. It was a watch in his chest pocket and while it didn't prevent injury, it reportedly blocked the worst of it. The watch was put in a museum after independence.
</li><li> In 1844, the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by an armed mob. There were a few other men with them at the time, including John Taylor (the third Mormon prophet), whose life was saved when a bullet hit his pocket watch. This story is unconfirmed, but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/pres-sm/images/03-48-4.gif">the watch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> provides some rather impressive evidence.
</li><li> In 1631, during <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Magdeburg">the Sack of Magdeburg<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the Lutheran priest Reinhard Bakes was slashed several times by a Catholic Croat soldier (in the Cathedral), but the Bible he was holding in his arms lasted long enough that the Croat abandoned the idea and let him live. The city still has the Bible.
</li><li> Daniel Inoyue, U.S. Senator from Hawaii, served in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> in the famous 442nd Infantry Regiment. Once, while leading an attack, a shot struck him in the chest directly above his heart, but the bullet was stopped by the two silver dollars he had in his shirt pocket.
</li><li> Prince (later King) Hussein of Jordan survived the assassination of his grandfather, King Abdullah I, at Friday prayers in 1952 when a bullet bounced off of a medal that the King made him wear on his shirt.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7318788/Womans-size-D-breast-implants-save-her-from-gunshot.html">Woman saved from gunfire by breast implants<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. There was also a woman who was shot in a club, and her implants <em>deflected</em> the bullet and saved her life.
</li><li> Composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeFredericHandel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeFredericHandel">George Frederic Handel</a> was once challenged to a sword duel. His opponent thrust, but the tip of the blade hit a large brass button on Handel's coat and snapped off.
</li><li> Colonel Joshua Chamberlain:
<ul><li> During the Battle of Gettysburg, a bullet that would have hit his leg and likely crippled him ricocheted off his sheathed saber. He was left with a limp, but was still able to command his famous "swinging door" charge shortly afterward.
</li><li> Ironically, Chamberlain was later hit in almost the same spot at siege of Petersburg. That time he'd already drawn his sword and the bullet punched through his pelvis, nearly killing him. Later at the Battle of Quaker Road, he was hit by yet another bullet that went through his horse's neck, a bible and a framed picture of his wife in his breast pocket, wounding but not killing him. He appeared to onlookers to have been shot directly through the chest, but instead the bullet after being deflected by the picture frame pierced his skin but skirted around his ribs before exiting his back. His men called him "Bloody Chamberlain," not because he was bloodthirsty but because he kept getting hit - six times in all over the course of the war. All those wounds would eventually catch up with him, but not until much later in life. When he died 1914 at the age of 85, the medical examination revealed that he died not of old age but of complications from the wound he suffered at Petersburg <em>fifty years earlier</em>. As a result, he's considered the very last casualty of the Civil War.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_the_Romanov_family">execution of the Romanov family<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the executioners had hard time killing the Romanov children, as they had sewn/hidden a large number of jewels inside their clothes, which gave them some degree of protection from the bullets and bayonets. They were ultimately forced to go for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshots</a>.
</li><li> In one highly anecdotal case, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Marine brony</a> was once saved by a present from his sister, a Fluttershy toy, <a class="urllink" href="http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/01/17/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-the-marine-brony/">when it stopped a bullet fragment.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> There's no mention of it anywhere else, though. It might just be "Bro-paganda".
</li><li> One victim of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_K%C3%BCrten">the Dusseldorf Ripper<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was saved from serious injury when he was stabbed in the back with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShearMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShearMenace">pair of scissors</a>, and the blades struck the heavy leather braces he was wearing.

</li><li> Lucien Neuwirth (French politician mostly know for the promulgation of a law allowing oral contraception in France), member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> than Free French Army during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, was shot by a German firing squad and survived thanks to his wallet.
</li><li> Back in 1881 a physician in Tombstone noticed that a silk handkerchief had stopped a bullet while treating the patient who took it. He experimented in developing bulletproof vests made of silk, and had some success, but they were far too expensive to be practical.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">Samurai</a> of status wore <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horo_(cloak)">a horo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in battle, a cloak of cloth strips sewn together that would catch the air as its wearer rode a horse and make it inflate, virtually resembling a balloon. This inflated cloak was believed to be able to deflect/slow arrows that struck it, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B_6BU7SYf8">an experiment considered this belief<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to have credence.
</li><li> Cell phones seem to be rather good for this:
