</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: The ages of the characters&mdash;and especially of the three main ones&mdash;has been a pestering question among the fandom since the character designs can be deceptive and the sparse information given leaves much to interpretation. Guts' age, at least, can be known at certain points in the story based on the number of years time-skipped since his birth. Unfortunately, although Casca says that she was twelve when Griffith took her in, she does not say how long ago that was and Griffith's exact age is not mentioned at any time. Everyone's guesses vary widely both on specific ages and on seemingly simple questions such as who is older or younger than who. An official guide book released in 2016 included the ages of major characters as of episode 347 (Guts, 24; Griffith, 24; Casca, 24; Serpico, 20; Farnese, 19; Rickert, 19; Isma, 15; Isidro, 14; Schierke, 13), but this raises as many questions as it answers since it sometimes leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a>, goes against a characters' appearance and relationship with other characters, and/or leads to contradictions in the timeline. For example, if you accept that Guts is 24 now, then following the timeskips backward Farnese would have been 14 when she led to Holy Iron Chain Knights to the pool of blood left behind by the Eclipse. Not only did she look older than that at the time, but the dialogue in the later flashback to her childhood establishes that she was 16 when she burned the Vandimion mansion and got banished to a convent, the event which led to her being put in charge of the HICKs in the first place. Logically she would have to be at least 21 to Guts' 24 in order for these things to be reconciled. Because of this and other probelms, including speculation that these ages may have been decided by some editor rather than Miura himself, there's a risk that many fans will simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">ignore the official ages</a> and continue to bicker just as they've always done.
</li><li> While she's clearly older than Tsutomu, the age of the title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a></em> was never stated in the OVA or <em>Decode</em>. In the OVA series, Tsutomu chastises Birdy for drinking alcohol due to a combination of the possibility of getting drunk while on duty and her being underaged, which given the legal drinking age in Japan is 20, suggests Birdy in the OVA series is at the oldest 19. However, in <em>Decode</em>, Birdy's age is easier to determine as flashbacks to her are shown when she was 10, a friend of hers while she was that age says he hasn't seen her for 14 years, and Tsutomu only reprimanding her for getting drunk, but not her age, suggests at the youngest, she's 24 there.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a>: He is said to have a reputation that would have to have been years in the making. He usually seems to appear no older than about thirty. In <em>Endless Odyssey</em>, one of his old comrades assumes that "he must be dead by now" and is genuinely suprised when he shows up, many years after their old adventures (Endless Odyssey is allegedly meant to pick up many years after the 1978 series left off). Also, if one were to even attempt to fit all or even some of his appearances into a coherent timeline (especially <em>Arcadia of My Youth</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em>, the 1978 series, and <em>Endless Odyssey</em>), you would end up with a Harlock that appears to have been active for decades.
</li><li> This was the case for most of the 00 cyborgs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Cyborg009">Cyborg009</a></em>, as Ishinomori never gave them established ages- with the exception of 009, who was 18 and 001 who was of (vague) infant age. The anime adaptations settle on 007 being the oldest (except for the '60s incarnations which made him a 9-year old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Kid-Appeal Character</a>) and in his '40s, 006 being a little younger than that, 005 and 004 either being in their late '20s or early '30s, 008 being in his early '20s, and 002 being in his early '20s or being 18 like 009. 003 either winds up younger than 009 in the earlier anime adaptations, being 16 or 17, or she's older in the '01 incarnation (physically 19, but chronologically <em>much</em> older due to being cryogenically frozen in the '60s).
</li><li> Mireille of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight">.hack//Legend of the Twilight</a></em>, who can be very knowledgeable at times, sometimes lord it over others, and sometimes just be cute and vulnerable. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She actually turns out to be the four-year-old daughter of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">identical character</a> from the first game, using her mother's file, and one of the other girls in Shugo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Harem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Harem">harem</a> is her home tutor, explaining some of it.</span>
</li><li> The three main Universe 6 Saiyans Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> physically they look like they're in their teens, but since Saiyans age slowly to keep in fighting shape they could be in their twenties, since Caulifla is the leader of a gang of adult Saiyans it seems to suggest the latter age range.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, Natsu's age hasn't been revealed even though most other members have a known age. Because he couldn't pass through Freed's barrier in the Battle of Fairy Tail, he is either 80+ years old (which seems a bit weird since he obviously has aged as he looked like a kid 6 years ago and a teenager now) or a stone statue (which makes even less sense). In terms of personality and appearance, he is probably supposed to be seen as being Lucy's age (17 years), as he looks a bit younger and acts more immature than 18-year-old Gray. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later chapters reveal that he is at least <em>400 years old</em>, a fact that he himself is unaware of. Natsu is actually Zeref's dead younger brother brought back to life as a demon powered by Etherious. It later turns out that he is <em>physically</em> as old as he looks, but by technicality he and the other true dragon slayers are 400 years old due to being born 400 years ago and sent forward in time via the Eclipse Gate. Also, the reason he and Gajeel couldn't pass through Freed's barrier is possibly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">they had their dragon parents in their bodies at the time</a> and they were probably older than 80</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>: The ages of certains characters like Kagura, Shinpachi, Kyuubei or Okita are known, but several other are only given a vague age. Gintoki and his companions from the time of the Joui war Katsura and Takasugi are in their twenties, but their exact age is not specified. Same go for Tsukuyo or Hijikata. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> justify it in most cases, as the characters with unknown ages are thoses who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">life circumstances</a> that could have led to them losing track of it. For exemple, Gintoki was found and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">adopted</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Shoyo</a> at a young age, and as a orphan from the Joui war probably don't know his exact age himself, and Hijikata have been a vagabond for a few years before meeting Kondo. Generally the characters who are given a precise age are thoses who had a relatively stable life and/or are too young to have fought in the war.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GugureKokkuriSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GugureKokkuriSan">Gugure Kokkuri San</a></em>: Putting aside the cases of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a> Kokkuri and Shiragaki, how old exactly is Kohina is not specified. All we know is that she is a young child in elementary-school. And her behavior doesn't exactly help to pinpoint it either, since she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">wise beyond her years</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>.
</li><li> None of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em> cyborgs have a given age. Henrietta seems to be between eleven and thirteen, while Triela is a little older, and Petra is the oldest and has a romance with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHandler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHandler">handler</a> but is still a teenager. To make it more confusing they seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">stunted</a> at the age they were Conditioned at and possibly years have passed between their backstory and the final chapter, so that leaves it vague what their biological ages are.

Rias is a high school senior, but as a pure-blooded devil it's plausible she's pushing quadruple digits. Akeno looks exactly the same age, but is significantly younger. Issei, Asia and Xenovia are exactly the age they look thanks to having been recently reincarnated, but Kiba is heavily implied to be decades older despite being in the same school year.

The fact that they have been having adventures since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> can be ignored since the series runs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>.

In the Chunin Exam arc it's mentioned that Kakashi graduated 6 years younger than Team 8, meaning he was 6 when he became genin. It's later mentioned that he graduated the academy at 5 and became a chunin at 6. His teammates, Obito and Rin, graduated at 9 and became chunin at 11. There <em>should</em> be an age-gap between them, except that Kakashi looks exactly the same age as Obito and Rin. Kakashi as a chunin doesn't look or act like a 6-year old. Maybe he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">Younger Than They Look</a>, but 11-year old Rin still has a crush on the apparently 6-year old Kakashi, which is likely not what was intended.

<ul><li> Unlike in the original, none of the character's ages are given initially. It's presumed that the characters are anywhere from 10-12 at the start. This is made more confusing because in Chapter 700 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Boruto and his friends seemed younger (fitting since they just started the academy) than they do in the early episodes of the anime (which also starts with them entering the academy). This might be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> as <em>Boruto</em> bumped that kids join the Ninja Academy (10-12 instead of 6-8, with less than 2 years passing before graduation).
</li><li> Boruto's sister Himawari is 2 years his junior. This would mean she's likely 8-10 years old, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiddieKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiddieKid">she doesn't act like one</a>. She's treated more like a 4-7 year old.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Unlike the games, the protagonist (Ash) is given a clear age of ten years old, however, the Pok&eacute;mon themselves are a mystery. Meowth is apparently an adult but everyone else is up in the air. Do Pok&eacute;mon age when they evolve? If a baby Pok&eacute;mon never evolves are they always considered a child? Is Donphan a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeSchoolgirl">large child</a>? Bulbasaur and the other first-stage Pok&eacute;mon are largely assumed to be 'child Pok&eacute;mon', but an early joke had them drunk and their species can breed. In another episode, an elderly Treecko was seen. It's never specified whether Pikachu is an adult or whether he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> like his trainer. Pikachu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou">Pok&eacute;mon: I Choose You!</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">speaks</a> for the first time and has a rather high pitched, childish voice</span>, implying that he's considered a child by Pok&eacute;mon standards.
</li><li> Most characters besides the protagonists have no age. Brock is fifteen according to supplementary material and Misty is ten like Ash, but unless their ages are given in the games it's unlikely anyone's age is given in the anime. May, Dawn, Iris, Serena, and Clemont all seem the same age as Ash but Cilan's age is just vaguely "mid-teens" from the looks of it (like Brock, his game counterpart seems to be an adult but the anime aged him down).
</li><li> Jessie and James. The only certainty is they're older than any of Ash's tagalongs. Jessie once said she was seventeen but that's probably her trying to seem younger than she is, and flashbacks imply she finished high school. The Japanese version has implied they're twenty-five in one of the movies and according to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/PokemonTheBirthOfMewtwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/PokemonTheBirthOfMewtwo">Pok&eacute;mon: The Birth of Mewtwo</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RadioDrama">Radio Drama</a> Jessie is over twenty. The radio drama supports Jessie being in her mid-twenties as the first part takes place twenty years before the series and Miyamoto (Jessie's mom) states her daughter is starting school. On the other hand, an in-series flashback to Jessie ten years ago has her seem <em>much</em> younger than fifteen, which would fit with her possibly being in her late teens. James is the same age as Jessie, but otherwise a similar mystery.
</li></ul></li><li> Mitsumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure">Pok&eacute;mon: Diamond and Pearl Adventure!</a></em> seems to be a teenager but her exact age is never given. She seems older than Jun, but he in turn seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">older</a> than his game counterpart so that doesn't help much.
</li><li> Jasmine is clearly in her late teens to early twenties in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pok&eacute;mon Adventures</a></em> she is the same size as the preteen Silver when she first appears.

She was described by mangaka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> as being a year younger than the lead character and became a teenaged girl when human, but also has been alive since the Silver Millennium.
</li><li> Usagi's younger brother's age can fluctuate from between two and four years younger than her depending on whether you're watching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> anime, the live-action series, or reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">the manga</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Amae Koromo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki">Saki</a></em>. Though she appears very child-like, she is a second-year student as opposed to the majority of Kiyosumi High's players like Saki, Nodoka, and Yuuki who are first-years, and it's been hinted that she's older than Nodoka.
</li><li> With the exception of three characters- Maka, Kilik, and Black*Star who are all confirmed to be 13 years old in the first half of the series- none of the cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> are given specific ages. This is not helped by the fact that the DWMA doesn't sort its students out by age, but instead by when the student enrolled and what skill level they are at. Tsubaki and Liz are hinted to be at least 2-3 years older than them, while it's unclear if resident Shinigami Death the Kid is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanHeLooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanHeLooks">Older Than He Looks</a> or ages just like them. When it comes to the adult cast, given that Spirit had Maka when he was 18, it can assumed that they are around their 30s. If the character is either a Witch or related to magic, they're even harder to pin down given that they can live for centuries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter">Soul Hunter</a></em>: We know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Taikoubou</a> is 72 years old at the beginning of the serie, and that is all we know. Other characters' ages are never stated explicitely, and because how much time have passed between the beginning and the end of the manga is'nt exactly stated either, even Taikoubou's precise age is hard to pinpoint. Since many characters in the setting can live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">for centuries</a> or even thousands of years, this make it sometimes impossible to guess. Youzen is a bit more than 250, since a flash-back set that much time ago show him as a very young child, and a flash back to Nataku's birth is set roughly ten years prior to his introduction, but he look older than this and is a particular case due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> (for exemple, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">his body was dead for around two or three of thoses years</a>).

So far, they've only given out two and a half: Barnaby's 24, Kaede's 9, and Kotetsu's kinda sorta probably somewhere between 33 and 39. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Maybe</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> As stated in the current page quote, it's never clearly stated how old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillerVillain">Noah</a>, Kaiba's stepbrother is. But if we were to make a guess, then he looked about twelve when Gozaburo showed him the photo of Kaiba, who was about seven at that time. So it can be guessed that Noah is five years older than Kaiba and would have been twenty-one had he been alive.
</li><li> Shizuka's age is also a myth. She looks about the same age as Anzu, but is definitely younger. Her age is guessed to be between 12 and 15. She is seen waring typical middle school attire in a photo seen is Jounochi's wallet.
</li><li> Mana's age is never stated clearly by Takahashi either. The anime made her younger than Atem for about 2 years, but then she is too big-breasted for a mere fourteen-year-old, so she can probably also be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a> and is actually older than Atem. We can't be sure, though.

Yusuke is 14, Kuwabara is 15, Shizuru is 18 in the manga and 21 or so in the anime, Kurama's human half, Shuichi, is 15, Koenma is centuries old, etc. That makes the characters we don't know quite odd. Botan is a spirit being, so she's justified. Hiei and Yukina on the other hand, no one knows. They're twins, meaning no matter the number they are the same age. Yukina belongs to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a> race that reproduces asexually once every 100 years, since she's never had any children and she's half the size of the others in her race (Hiei too) she's obviously a "child" (at least in a demon sense). There is some knowledge that they're at least 16, which means they're 16-99 years old. Vague age indeed.

Most descriptions and her appearance in the story state she was a "little girl" at the time of her death (which was in 1917 if the story is set in 2011), while most (readers and Anya) assume her to be around Anya's age. Either way, her age isn't clear.

Between the art style used for all the characters, and the features of Asterix himself, he looks somewhere between 20 and 60. What that actually makes him is anyone's guess. Lampshaded in <em>The Cauldron</em>, where he's working for a wrestling promoter who actually describes him in his 'roll-up' pitch as being 'of indeterminate age'. (One short story strip of dubious canoninity - due to being outside of an official volume and containing some inconsistencies with other stories &#150; states Asterix and Obelix are 35 "when their adventures begin".) Many other characters have ambiguous ages too.

Promotional materials for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em> painted his age at around his early 50s even after Bruce has been Batman for three years, yet if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanPertwee">Sean Pertwee</a>'s age is anything to go by, the Alfred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em> is around that when Thomas and Martha Wayne died. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCaine">Michael Caine</a> was 71 during the fimling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, which features a Bruce Wayne who's 30 and just starting out as Batman, whereas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyIrons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyIrons">Jeremy Irons</a> was 65 for the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em>, which features a Bruce Wayne in his 40s with a 20 year career as the Dark Knight. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregRucka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregRucka">Greg Rucka</a>'s novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">Batman: No Man's Land</a></em> states Alfred couldn't be older than 60 when Bruce had been Batman for ten years.

Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a></em> #865 where a childhood-obsessed, adult hating version of the Toyman tells his story to Jimmy Olsen alone because he doesn't trust anyone over the age of eighteen. Jimmy kicks him over and shouts that he's <em>twenty-three</em> years old exactly.
</li><li> The pygmies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PocketGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PocketGod">Pocket God</a></em> may appear to be small children given their size, but most of them don't act like it. They don't even know their own ages or how long they've been around; probably as a side effect of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">Resurrective Immortality</a>.

While every other character would have their age blatantly stated every time they were introduced (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Knives Chau, Age 17</a>), Ramona's introduction was always followed by "Age Unknown." At one point, Scott <em>lampshades the lampshading</em> when Ramona gets mad at him for not knowing how old she is. He defends himself with, "But your age is unknown!"
</li><li> Granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a> are defined as 100 years old (with the exception of Papa Smurf who is 542, Baby Smurf who is two, and Smurfette and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the former Naughties from the second live-action movie</span>, who were created later), but what makes them an example of the trope is the fact that it's unclear which human age equals that; most of them have specific jobs inside the village, yet they frequently play ball and act immature. Maybe one thing or the other may be the consequence of living in a small village led by their father (Papa Smurf is no mere name &mdash; he raised the 98 Smurfs). They were more clearly defined as adults when three of them were age-reversed to Smurflings, which made the adult Smurfs behave somewhat more mature. This gets even more complicated with the appearance of Gutsy Smurf with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotbloodedSideburns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotbloodedSideburns">sideburns</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSmurfs">live-action movie</a>, since most of his fellow Smurfs don't have facial hair.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>: It's never made exactly clear how old Tintin is. He is obviously young, but has no problems going round the world and getting into adventures without any mention of parents or the like. It is known that he works as a reporter, but he's not seen actually performing this job. He does live together with Captain Haddock in his castle, along with Professor Calculus. In response to this, Herge was actually asked to create a character with a family, mum, dad, little sister, pet, etc. in order to have a more "realistic" series of adventures. The result was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JoZetteAndJocko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JoZetteAndJocko">Jo, Zette and Jocko</a></em>, a fun, but less successful series. As Herge pointed out, it was much harder to keep track of all those characters. At least good old Tintin was unencumbered. Not everyone gets to be an orphan.
</li><li> Thanks to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> being forcibly activated at the age of <em>seven</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X-23</a>'s age becomes much less clear. She <em>looks</em> about 17, but because her aging process is slowed by her mutation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">she can easily be years older than this</a>. However a closer look at the dates given in her various solo appearances does confirm an age of 17 by the time she joins the X-books proper: She escaped the Facility at 13, was 14-15 while staying with her cousin and aunt (which can be verified because Megan was still in high school, and is known to be a couple years older than Laura), and 15-16 during <em>NYX</em>.
</li><li> Kitty Pryde is the original example of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> comics. Introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Kid</a> of the team, she slowly appeared to age up. This came to a head when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a> took the reigns of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Excalibur">Excalibur</a></em> and decided he wanted Kitty to be in a relationship with the very much adult Peter Wisdom. This sent the Marvel Offices into a panic because in their minds, Kitty was still a "teenager". Eventually, they found middle ground and decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeGapRomance">portray the romance</a> as being like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Leia and Han Solo</a>." Since then, writers have been extremely vague with exactly how old Kitty actually is, especially considering there's been other characters who were introduced as teenagers after Kitty up rapidly aged up to be the same age as her or even older.

This is muddled by the fact that they don't live in a linear timeline, and some of them simply look older in a relative manner to the others. For instance, Agent Diamond is less than five feet tall (despite her impressive bosom), and is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>, while her boyfriend, Agent Chimera, is six foot three and generally quite mature.

She is described as being "so young" when she was diagnosed and presumably didn't make it to her teens, according to her sister's narration.

She had since corrected this mistake.</span>,by the time chapter 12 comes around. Ryuuko's vague age is a plot point, as her age not being known complicates rehabilitation, as the older she is, the less they are to recover what was lost to isolation (i.e, see <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)">Genie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). What definitely forestalls calculation is the fact that when her sisters find scant photos of Ryuuko, they have the month and date on them but they don't have a year on them, in which case they go by her appearance in the photos, along with the fact that the two that did know, Ragyo and Rei, her secretary, are dead and there are no real legal documents of her.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EmpathTheLuckiestSmurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EmpathTheLuckiestSmurf">Empath: The Luckiest Smurf</a></em> series, as Empath and his fellow Smurfs are depicted as being in their early adult stage around 150 years of age, with Homnibus commenting on how young Empath looks for his age.
</li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Gensokyo20XX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Gensokyo20XX">Gensokyo 20XX series</a>, there's this with the kids but more explicitly with Yume Ni, An, Maribel, Renko, and an age-regressed Reimu. What is known so far is Yume Ni and An are fairly close in age, with Yu being at least a toddler at the time of An's birth and Reimu being at least in her formative years age-regression wise, with Maribel and Renko being a little unable to say their names correctly, as well speaking more on the level Reimu spoke at. The best estimate for the kids in general would be that their ages are vague, although Reimu and Chen would be older than they are chronologically, as biologically the former's a child, where as chronologically, she would at least in her twenties, and Chen is a youkai definition of a child, as far as that goes. From a branch off, <em>Foundling</em>, Reimu again is supposed to be a toddler or, as the narration seemed to suggest, as she is shown to be past walking age, yet she is described as not being old enough to articulate (or rather, converse).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KillLaKillAU">Kill la Kill AU</a></em>, there's this with Ragyo and Soichiro, which would be hard to figure out, as they (then) have three kids who were eleven, nine, and eight and both Ragyo and Soichiro's parents are shown to have grey hair when they're first seen, along with being married for at least seven years prior to their divorce, thus at the most they would probably be in their late thirties at the least, if not early forties at the most. In that vein, there's also Rei, the drunk secretary, although, apparently, she is old enough to drink and can be seen doing so <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1383d');"><sup>Note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1383d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1383d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To go a bit further, the legal drinking age in Japan is at least 19 or 20 years old, something the authoress didn't know at the time of the comic's start</span>. What makes Soichiro's age more vague are his siblings, considering that his oldest brother, Bunmei, looks to be a good 11 or 10 years old, at the time he was shown as a baby <a class="urllink" href="http://kill-la-kill-au.tumblr.com/image/144558466643">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which in turn brings his parents' age into question.

Their ages are not mentioned, however, Satsuki is stated is to have been too young to comprehend what was going on between her parents and then later her mother's mental illness, as her recollections of the past support, and she states that Ryuuko and Nui were too young to understand death and neither were they old enough to remember the events leading up to the house being burned down and them fleeing from it.
</li><li> According to chapter 10 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OneMoreTimeOneMoreChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OneMoreTimeOneMoreChance">One More Time, One More Chance</a></em>, Ryuuko's a teen, although some of her behavior and appearance (she's mentioned to be small for her age) would imply that she's younger. The only clue we had to Ryuuko being in that age range was an author note saying that Satsuki is about five years older.
</li><li> Ages are hard to gauge in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheOutside">The Outside</a></em>, however, the story implies that Ryuuko is 12 and Satsuki is 22 but we don't know exactly how old Shiro and Nui are besides the latter being the youngest of the cast (she's described to be about six).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheParselmouthOfGryffindor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheParselmouthOfGryffindor">The Parselmouth of Gryffindor</a></em>, Professor Max has been the Ghoul Studies professor "since the 18th or 19th century", and calls 120-year-old Dumbledore "young"&#133; but at the same time does not look that old, not having a single gray hair for one thing. Methuselah Syndrome is probably at play.
</li><li> Like the above Anime example, Ash Ketchum in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines">Pok&eacute;mon Reset Bloodlines</a></em> has an uncertain age. In the old timeline at least. Yes, even <em>Ash himself</em> doesn't know how old he was in the original anime, and in reference to it he can only measure things in gyms (That happened over the course of five gyms, it took four gyms for X to evolve, etc). Even looking at his memories, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sabrina</span> can't figure out how old he exactly was, and even notes that at one point May seemed to have aged <em>backwards</em>. He's also unsure of how old the Team Rocket trio is supposed to be. In the new timeline Ash is well aware of his age, which is 15, and wondering what his canon age was is a running gag.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TwiceUponAnAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TwiceUponAnAge">Twice Upon an Age</a></em> series, this is the case with Mahanon. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Lord Inquisitor</a> doesn't actually know how old he is, because - as he explains to Varric, who mentions it in a letter - the Dalish don't pay much attention to things like birthdays. He knows that it's been about fifteen winters since he received his facial tattoos, which he received as a young man, so they estimate him to be in approximately his early thirties.
</li><li> Ragyo Kiryuin's age in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NaturalSelection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NaturalSelection">Natural Selection</a></em> is left unknown even in-universe. She laughs it off as a meaningless number and went out of her way to erase all records of her birth certificate, including burning down the hospital she was born in just to make sure her age stays unknown.

The sequel doesn't seem to take place more than a year or two later, since Fievel is still a young child and their baby sister Yasha is still only a toddler.

<ul><li> Scamp looks like a young puppy but has the voice of a teenager. His sisters sound younger despite being his littermates. Scamp and his sisters are all significantly smaller than both of their parents, implying that they're still growing as well.
</li><li> Scamp's love interest Angel is also puppy-looking, but it doesn't seem like she'll grow much more; it's unclear how much of her puppy-like appearance is age and how much of it is genetics since she's a Pomeranian. She has a mature voice, and an <em>adult</em> dog seems to be in love with her. It's also mentioned that Angel is old enough to have been through five families.

<ul><li> Kovu and Kiara's ages are hard to tell. They could be either teenagers or young adults.

The documentary <em>Proud of Simba's Pride</em> also refers to Kovu as a teenager.

But then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">he's an undead skeleton</a>, and supposedly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">embodiment of Halloween</a>&#133; so for all we know, he may be centuries old and just <em>seems</em> youthful.
</li><li> The titular Peter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> has all his baby teeth (which usually begin to fall out at age five or six) according to both the original book and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DisneyFairies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DisneyFairies">Disney Fairies</a></em> spinoff series, but his design resembles more of a boy between ten and thirteen.

Billy is shorter than them, so he's possibly younger, but he's obviously not a preschooler. Sarah, the boy's sister, is also ambiguous, although she's probably older than two.
</li><li> Some of the contestants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sing">Sing</a></em> are ambiguous when it comes to their age. None of them are seen attending school, the existence of which is demonstrated by Rosita's piglets getting on a school bus. Ash is called a "teenager" but seems to live without parents and is looking for work with her boyfriend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until they broke up</span>, so she is probably around 18 or 19. Johnny lives with his father but is designed to look and sound like a young adult. Furthermore, when his father goes to prison, there is no mention of child services or social workers. Meena lives with her maternal relatives and acts like a younger teenager (13 to 16), but a picture held up by someone at a party suggests she has graduated from high school.

While all game characters are technically immortal unless they die along with their game or outside of it, Ralph looks to be in his 30s while Felix and Calhoun appear more in their late 20s. Meanwhile, Vanellope and all her racing rivals are supposed to be about 9 or 10 years old. The games they come from (and by extension, the characters themselves) have different ages. Ralph and Felix have been around for 30 years. Vanellope's game has been around for at least 15 years and Calhoun's game was only installed a week before the events of the movie, making her the youngest character chronologically.

Pfeiffer was 33 years old when filming began, but her character often acts as if she's just out of college. Indeed, Selina comes across more as a stereotypical Gen-X <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSnarker">Stepford Snarker</a> than the assertive Baby Boomer career-woman type who was so common in American films of the 1980s and early '90s. Perhaps Pfeiffer (born 1958) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">helped originate the trope</a>?

He refuses repeated efforts to pry his age from him, as well as a variety of other personal details he keeps mysterious. This is based on the real behavior of Wiseau, whose true age is still not publicly known.
</li><li> Four and Eric in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Divergent">Divergent</a></em> films. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent">The book states</a> that the initiates take their test when they're sixteen, and Four and Eric's generation are eighteen. In the films they are played by actors in their late twenties, so their ages are left deliberately vague as a result.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>. According to the novelization of the film he's over 10 million years old. Other sources put him at about 800 years old, and he's shown to be a child in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">book E.T: The Book of the Green Planet.</a>

Judy Garland was sixteen at the time, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuppressedMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuppressedMammaries">costumed to look younger</a>, and promotional materials tend to give the character's age as twelve.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfTomSawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfTomSawyer">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a></em>: Tom Sawyer is an example of this trope oft-cited by literary critics. He's described as "a small boy" and sometimes shows the naivet&eacute; of a very young child, yet his romantic interest in Becky Thatcher and bouts of melancholy brooding feel more suited to a twelve- or thirteen-year-old.
</li><li> Ascanius, Aeneas's son in the <em>Aeneid</em>, is at varying points in the poem young enough to curl up on Dido's lap at dinner (or at least, no one thinks it's weird when Cupid impersonates him to do so), and old enough to fight in the war. He appears to be somewhere between four and fourteen, never specified.
</li><li> Chichi deliberately invokes this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AkataWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AkataWitch">Akata Witch</a></em>. She refuses to tell anyone how old she is, except when she's teasing an older man. After she gets him excited, she tells him she's twelve (or whatever age she feels like being), laughs at his horror, and runs off.
</li><li> Applegate used this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> to make the titular group relatable to as wide a demographic as possible. In-universe, this was justified as part of the characters' many attempts to protect their own identities. In the last book, it was revealed that they were 13 at the time they first met Elfangor and 16 by the time the Yeerks surrendered.
</li><li> Vardaman from William Faulkner's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsILayDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsILayDying">As I Lay Dying</a></em> has no set age, and it is often debated as to whether he is young or just retarded (or both). He's the youngest of his five siblings, and the next-youngest is obviously at least a teenager.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a></em>, the story of Isaac's near-sacrifice has him speaking to his father Abraham the way a young child would, asking him, on the way up the mountain, where the sheep was for their burnt offering, and Abraham replying evasively, "God will see to the sheep for his burnt offering, my son," as though to shield him from the horrible truth until the last moment. However, based on the internal chronology of the book, Isaac would've been thirty-seven years old at the time. Thus, the Jewish sages of late antiquity deemed Isaac as old enough to give informed consent to his own sacrifice.
</li><li> Another Genesis example of this trope is Benjamin, youngest son of Jacob, at the time of his family's relocation to Egypt. His birth takes place before his older brother Joseph is sold into slavery, which should make him at least twenty-two at the time of their Egypt reunion. Yet throughout that later part of the story, his father and brothers still refer to him as a "lad," shelter him and barter over him as if he were a child. And yet the subsequent list of Jacob's sons, grandsons and great-grandsons who traveled to Egypt includes the names of Benjamin's many children. It seems likely that two different versions of the story with different chronologies were combined.
</li><li> The ages of Jesus' disciples are never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. They are usually depicted as adult men of assorted ages.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>, the ages of the younger princesses are left vague, but they are not "of age" and still play with toy soldiers. Due to them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a>, this is not as good a hint on their actual age as it could be - they could deliberately continue to play war with their younger sisters in order to learn about strategy and line of command. There also are some older noblewomen mentioned in the backstory, who are "ancient", but there's still no word about their actual age, they could simply have aged badly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Coraline">Coraline</a> is hard to pin down. Illustrations make her seem anywhere from 11 to 14 and she's stated several times to be small for her age so she could easily be a teen. Mentally she can be similar to a middle schooler but at other times seems more like an 8 year old. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coraline">film</a> pins her age at 11.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a> deliberately kept the ages of her child-characters vague unless there was a plot reason not to, to broaden their appeal to child readers. At a certain stage it can be off-putting to find out that the hero of the book you're reading is younger than you are (if you're eleven, nine seems pretty young). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hexwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hexwood">Hexwood</a></em>, some characters' Vague Age is a plot point in itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a></em>: Greg and his peers are twelve, Rodrick and his peers are 16, Manny and his peers are three, Peepaw (Greg's great-grandfather) is 93, Gammie (Greg's great-grandmother) is 95 and another family the Snellas have a baby named Seth and a six-year-old named Shawn, but we don't really know the ages of the other characters. We know that Greg's grandparents are elderly, and his parents are probably at least 36, that Greg's uncles Gary and Joe are younger than his dad, his aunt Cakey is older than his mom and his aunt Gretchen is younger than her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, this is something of a plot point. Axiel's exact age is not known, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is later revealed to be half dwarf, and much older than he looks</span>. While ages are given for younger characters, this is often not the case with the older generation. Aunt Stala, for example, might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Cool Old Lady</a>, as her hair is already grey, but she is the half-sister of Ward's mother, who gave birth to him when she was about sixteen, and therefore could be about thirty-six. Though of course Stala could be a lot older than her sister, being illegitimate.
</li><li> The eponymous girl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FelicityFlooVisitsTheZoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FelicityFlooVisitsTheZoo">Felicity Floo Visits The Zoo</a></em> looks anywhere between two and nine. She wanders around the zoo seemingly on her own, but seeing as she's sick, maybe she wandered off without her parents noticing.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fred">Fred</a></em> has the kids Sophie and Nick. Nick has an Elmer Fudd lisp and seems sort of whiny at times (like when he's complaining about getting less drink than Sophie and when he's frustrated about not being able to see), but is otherwise very articulate. Sophie is significantly taller than him, but she also looks very young.
</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaroldAndThePurpleCrayon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaroldAndThePurpleCrayon">Harold and the Purple Crayon</a></em> is old enough to walk around, seems pretty intelligent, can draw very well, and yet doesn't have much hair and wears a onesie.
</li><li> It was initially unclear how old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>'s parents were when they died. While their friend Sirius (who is the same age) is referred to as "young Sirius Black" in the first book, his friendship with the Potters isn't revealed until the third book, and the "young" could easily be taken as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>. In a 2001 interview, however, it was indirectly confirmed that they did indeed die young&mdash;less than four years after graduating (the interview in question was about Snape's age). However, the first movie, which was released the same year, contradicted this to make them appear middle-aged, and until the final book, their age at the time of their deaths was something you'd have to be pretty observant to know.
</li><li> The bird protagonist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">his/her/their</a> classmates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowToBeComfortableInYourOwnFeathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowToBeComfortableInYourOwnFeathers">How To Be Comfortable In Your Own Feathers</a></em> can fly, but go to school. Maybe they start their education as adults, but the protagonist looks smaller than Mother Bird.
</li><li> L. Frank Baum's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books:
<ul><li> Apart from her being a "little girl," Dorothy's age is never made clear. The original illustrations for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em> portrayed her as only about five or six, but later illustrators have sometimes made her look as old as twelve. <em>The Giant Horse of Oz</em> eventually implies that she's eleven, though this takes place several years after her first visit to Oz. And of course, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">Adaptation Displacement</a>, the general public tends to imagine her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">sixteen-year-old Judy Garland.</a>
</li><li> Ozma's age is never concrete either, besides Baum saying she wasn't any older than sixteen. One book pins her as looking like she's in her early teens while another book pins her as looking 14-15. Some illustrations have her as an adult (or at least a teenager), while some have her as a child similar to Dorothy. Typically she's depicted as being a few years older than Dorothy; however, it's also stated that she's an immortal fairy. Well, sometimes - Baum was very inconsistent with Ozma's backstory. To make things more confusing, her male alter ego Tip is almost always depicted as a preteen boy and acts very boyish as well.
</li></ul></li><li> A character from one of Baum's later sequels has her age given as "old enough to make jam," which should tell you everything you need to know for his concern about identifying his characters' ages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleBear">Little Bear</a></em>:
<ul><li> The bear himself is fully verbal and can wander around without parental supervision but has never been to school and is clearly a cub.
</li><li> Cat, Hen, and Duck are clearly fully-grown animals but they're pretty naive.
</li><li> Emily is a schoolgirl but her age is not revealed in the books, though the cartoon has her turning seven in one episode (while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge">looking at least ten</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mog">Mog</a></em>: Nobody's ages are outright said except for Mog's adopted kittens in "Mog's Kittens", Matilda's kittens, and Rumpus, who are all kittens so they're under a year old. Mog herself has her first Christmas in "Mog's Christmas" and her second in "Mog's Christmas Calamity", so that makes her about two or three years old. Debbie hasn't developed breasts, so she's probably twelve at the oldest, and Nicky is shorter than her (so probably younger) but not a toddler.
</li><li> Everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins">The Moomins</a></em>, though some are more vague than others, and especially Snufkin because he is treated like a child by the Moomin parents and yet has a tendency to wander off alone.
</li><li> Professor Cole in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Murderess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Murderess">Murderess</a></em>, who can transform into a teenage boy and back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em>:The main character Bastian is described as being a boy of ten or twelve.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeepAndEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeepAndEgg">Peep And Egg</a></em>, both titular characters look like chicks, but Peep seems like she's an adult what with her running the show and behaving maturely. Egg is meant to be newly-hatched but acts more like a toddler than a baby, and in "I'm Not Using the Potty", he <em>reads</em>.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>. He still has all his baby teeth, which would imply that his physical age is just five or six, but his intelligence level seems higher than that (of course he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>) and all the female characters have crushes on him. Ditto for Wendy, who is said to be the same size as Peter, but whose maturity level is far past the "still has only baby teeth" phase. Unsurprisingly, most adaptations ignore the baby teeth issue and make both Peter and Wendy seem about twelve years old.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RainbowMagic">Rainbow Magic</a></em> series, it's never stated how old Rachel and Kirsty are supposed to be. They could be anywhere from very young to middle school aged.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SamBangsAndMoonshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SamBangsAndMoonshine">Sam, Bangs, and Moonshine</a></em>, Sam seems about eight and Thomas seems about four, but they're allowed to be alone for most of the day and Thomas can even ride his bike to Sam's house.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sunny is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">exceptionally clever for a baby</a>, and her physical development occurs in a deliberately uneven, contradictory way; for example, even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she learns to walk</span>, she is small enough to sleep in a casserole dish. Her exact age is not specified for the first twelve books, and flashbacks to "before Sunny" carefully avoid giving her older siblings' ages at the time, forestalling calculation. The thirteenth book stated that Sunny was about two, which would mean she was about six months at the most in book one, and eighteen months have passed since.
</li><li> Carmelita Spats. In the book where she is introduced, she seems old enough to be the leader of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a> and to be one of the most popular girls in school &mdash; but, in the later books, she acts much younger.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhite">Snow White</a></em>: Snow White is said to be seven years old when she first becomes the fairest in the land, but at the end of the story, she marries the prince. There's no explanation for this, though different illustrators have handled it differently: some show her spending years with the seven dwarfs and growing up before the queen finds her (though why would it take the queen years to consult her magic mirror again?), some show her still growing while "dead" in her glass coffin and some also portray the prince as a small boy and have a romanticized child marriage in the end. Most adaptations (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Disney's</a>, which aged her to fourteen) cut out the "seven years old" reference and just portray her as a young woman from the start.

It is unlikely that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>, but Demane mentions that Captain's been in the mercenary business for a couple decades already. His looks are very vague, age-wise, and his behaviour is that of a hardened veteran towards the band and that of an occasionally insecure 20-something when alone with Demane.
</li><li> Just about everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong">Tailchaser's Song</a></em>. Tailchaser mentions that he is turning 9 months old in chapter 8, Pouncequick is young enough that even several months into the novel he's still a kitten, Eatbugs is elderly and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Really700YearsOld">young-looking</a> amnesiac <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a></span>, Roofshadow is older than Tailchaser but still young enough to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a>, and Hushpad is around Tailchaser's age. Everyone else is unclear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thumbelina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thumbelina">Thumbelina</a></em>: Thumbelina is sent to a woman who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">wants a child</a> in the beginning, and the walnut shell where she sleeps is described as her "cradle." Yet the whole story revolves around different animals wanting to marry her and she finally does marry a fairy king in the end. It varies among illustrators whether she's portrayed as a little girl or a young woman.
</li><li> Applies to many characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrashOfTheCountsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrashOfTheCountsFamily">Trash of the Count's Family</a></em>, though some people's estimated ages are more specific than others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Eruhaben</a> is almost 1000, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Choi Han</a> is "decades" old, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">though he still looks 17</a>.
</li><li> Varjak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VarjakPaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VarjakPaw">Varjak Paw</a></em> is repeatedly referred to as a kitten but already looks like an adult cat (albeit smaller). Due to how cats age, it's unknown if this means he's a preadolescent or a teenager. Cats are considered kittens until they are one years old and six-month olds can be almost as large as their parents.
</li><li> Aging the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warriors</a></em> can be difficult. Cats are considered kittens until they're 12 months old, but in <em>Warriors</em> cats stop being kits at 6 moons. However, instead of being adults, they're treated more like mature teenagers and are noted to still be growing. It's also shown that the Clans used a different aging system early on, with Moth Flight being implied to be apprentice-aged despite having an adult name and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">being pregnant</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pooh himself will apparently be ninety-nine when Christopher Robin, who's six, is a hundred, which should logically mean he is five, and he has the naivete of a five-year-old, yet he lives alone and seems to have a somewhat adult mentality despite his naivete.
</li><li> Piglet's name suggests he's a kid, and he thinks he's three or four, but he too lives alone and he has an even more grown-up personality than Pooh. Then again, he still occasionally behaves like a kid, and while he is literate, he can't spell his name.
</li><li> Roo is sometimes called "baby Roo" but he is clearly not an infant. He seems to be pretty physically capable and articulate, yet he's clearly a kid, he's illiterate (just smudging the page instead of signing his name in the last story) and one book has him take a nap, suggesting he is a preschooler.
</li><li> Tigger is a mystery. He arrives in the forest wandering around alone, but he's even more naive than Pooh, not even knowing what his likes, dislikes, and skills are. He lives with Kanga, but it's a little unclear whether he's meant to be her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesAdoption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesAdoption">son</a> or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentCohabitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentCohabitation">flatmate</a>. In the cartoons, he has an adult voice, but his voice is never described in the books.

Most notable with Lexa, the Grounder's Commander. She's young enough that Abby refers to the Grounders as being "led by a child", but it's unclear if that's literal and Lexa really is under 18, or if she's simply unusually young given that she's leading an entire nation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, in the earlier seasons: Most of the characters were in their twenties, but nobody knew exactly where.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>: Diane's exact age is never given, and she dodges the subject whenever it comes up, though presumably she is the same age as her actress was.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>: Abed is somewhere in his twenties, but where is anyone's guess. Several episode imply he's actually in his mid-thirties (matching his actor) and thus much closer to Shirley and Jeff than he acts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FarScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FarScape">FarScape</a></em>, for much of its run, which is odd considering how often the show mentions time passing. In the first episode, D'Argo's age is given as 30 cycles (young for a Luxan, which means he married very young &mdash; a plot point). Everyone else's age stays mostly vague. Chiana is often stated to be "a kid" compared to the others, and acts as though she's in her late teens/early twenties. John's age can eventually be inferred as about 30 when he joins Moya, since he's old enough to drive in 1986 and was presumably born in 1969 or 1970.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em> has Blanche Devereaux, who prides herself on her looks and as such constantly lies about her age, usually implying herself to be in her early forties or even her late <em>thirties</em>. The other girls of the house however are not fooled despite her overconfident facade, and several jokes have been poked at how they can't pinpoint her exact age. In one episode Rose manages to acquire her birth certificate from her home state of Georgia, only to find her age "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Deleted By Authority of the Governor</a>". Adding to this, the season two opener sees Blanche coping with menopause, suggesting she is indeed well into her fifties. All hints aside though, Blanche usually succeeded in keeping herself relatively youthful looking for a woman her age.

<ul><li> While Mork the alien is fully-grown and doesn't seem elderly, his real <em>age</em> is a mystery. He has his first birthday in "Mork Runs Down", but in the same episode, he is told he's "not a bleemager anymore" and a "bleem" is said to be two thousand human years. He also claims that on his home planet, birthdays only happen "every two thousand zymes", whatever that means.
</li><li> His son Mearth was born in the last season and has chronologically only aged a year, but it's unknown how old he is in "human years". He learned to speak in full sentences the day he was born but still wore a diaper and there's no mention of him using the bathroom. He goes to school, and at one point his parents think he has a crush.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em> has Fran Fine, who is constantly dodging questions regarding her true age, even though in season one she celebrated what was allegedly her thirtieth birthday. Many in the household though have wondered if she's actually older, with her always coming back to insist that she could still be in her twenties. In a later episode, it was revealed that even the FBI agents performing her background check couldn't figure it out.
</li><li> In the seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> where the characters are not high school students, the Rangers' ages tend to be left vague at best. They are often provided in promotional materials (for some characters), though even these are notoriously unreliable: Bridge, the only character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a></em> with a definitive age, was listed as 17 on the Jetix website but is explicitly 21 in the show proper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution">Revolution</a></em>: The characters have not been given ages for the most part.

This is reasonably close the character's actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamRogers">Graham Rogers</a>'s age, which is 17 years old. Captain Riley is apparently the youngest captain the Monroe Republic has.

However, in later seasons (and in the spinoff), they are clearly older teens, while Maddie and London are the same age: In the spinoff the twins and London go to school together.

The humans' ages are kept vague, not helped by the show's rather fluid sense of time. Lampshaded by Nicole's mother when she objects to her relationship with Sam:

She's played by 20-year old Melanie in music videos but the actual character is vague in age. In the "Pity Party" music video there are nine candles on her birthday cake (though fans do argue if it's symbolic of something else) and artwork depicts her as a little girl. She also dresses in stereotypically "childish" attire such as pastel dresses with ribbons, but that's a popular fashion for adults as well.

In the video to "Cry Baby" Melanie could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">either</a> be an adult playing a toddler or Cry Baby could have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveMom">Abusive Mom</a> who makes her dress like a baby.

But the scene with the gravediggers gives his age as thirty (or thereabouts), and he remembers Yorick, who died twenty-three years prior. The historical explanation is that Hamlet was probably originally intended to be a teenager but that Shakespeare changed his age so his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionPosse">usual star</a> Richard Burbage could play the role.

It was probably done deliberately, since the play is extremely popular in Russia and gets produced everywhere from kindergartens to opera houses. In particular, depending on the age of the Stepdaughter (and the target audience), her romance with April can be played up, kept as subtext, or omitted entirely.

Throughout the 1980s and into the 2000s she was usually portrayed as an adult, while her sister Skipper was a teenager, but a 2010s decision led to Barbie being aged back into a high schooler on default (but Skipper is also a teen and Barbie does still often get presented as an adult). In the past Barbie has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">become US president</a> and done other things that imply she's older than her twenties. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BarbieLifeInTheDreamhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BarbieLifeInTheDreamhouse">Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse</a></em> affectionately pokes fun at, and lampshades, her Vague Age.
</li><li> Skipper is younger than her sister Barbie, Due to Barbie's fluctuating age, Skipper herself is only vaguely 14-17, with some dolls saying she's 16. She was originally introduced as a preteen but was revamped several times in the 1970s and 1980s so that she hit puberty.

<ul><li> Your fellow villagers in are... mystifying, to say the least. They live on their own, so they're adults, right? But some of them mention still having allowance, and some of their birthday messages imply they're not yet adults. But there are no parents anywhere (and, in fact, the female kangaroo villagers <em>have children of their own</em>). The "Grumpy" and "Snooty" villagers act older than the others, with some of their dialogue implying they're probably at the youngest, in their early 30's. With the rest of the clan, it's anybody's guess. It gets even more confusing with the bear villagers as there are both full grown bears and cubs <em>and they're treated as different species</em>.
</li><li> The protagonists are equally vague. You look like children but are implied to be adults (they live on their own, pay mortgages, and drink coffee), though at least one letter implies you're not an adult yet. <em>New Leaf</em> made the player characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">more lanky</a> and less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a>, but they still resemble children in some aspects (while also making them mayors of the town). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros4">Super Smash Bros. 4</a></em> makes it even vaguer as they refer to Villager as a "young man" in his trophy. He doesn't have a voice so you can't tell his tone either.
</li><li> It's hard to tell how old Sable is. It's implied she's of similar age to the (apparently) middle aged Tom Nook, but she doesn't seem that old. There is a ten year age gap between her and Mabel. Sable is vaguely anywhere from her early thirties to somewhere in her forties. Labelle is explicitly older than Sable, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since she's the oldest sister,</span> but doesn't look it either.
</li></ul></li><li> Master Mummy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS">ARMS</a></em> has his age listed as "Unknown".

However, her sprite and portrait in the actual game suggest an older teen, if not a young adult. This may be a spoof on games from the 80s and early 90s, where consistency in character design wasn't exactly a top priority in a lot of titles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead">Cuphead</a></em>: Both Cuphead and Mugman look rather young and live with their mentor, the Elder Kettle. And while the plot is kicked off by gambling, it's hard to tell if they're actually legal gambling age, or not, because it's unlikely that a casino run by the Devil would even care about that. According to writer Evan Skolnick, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/EvanSkolnick/status/953431259161673728">Cuphead and Mugman are adolescents<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gpdn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1gpdn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gpdn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In case you didn't know, an adolescent is a teen that has hit puberty; in other words, they are teens: not children, but not yet adults.</span> though the exact age is still unknown.

However, one bit of information allows for an educated estimate of her age. Thus far, the only attempt at a timeline for the series is confirmation that the third game takes place ten years before the seventh; it can be approximated, therefore, that the series has been happening for at least roughly fifteen years in-universe, which would put the detective at the time of the tenth game in at least her thirties. She could possibly even be older than that, depending on how old she was intended to be when the series began, but since she was already established as a professional detective in the first game she must have been an adult.
</li><li> We don't know how old any of the three player characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DetectivesUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DetectivesUnited">Detectives United</a></em> are supposed to be.

Agent Brown is invisible, so he has no appearance, although his voice would suggest a man in about his forties.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean">Endless Ocean</a>: Blue World</em>, nobody's age is pinned down, but of note are Professor Sakurai, who is said by Oceana to be "too young" to have done all she's done; Oceana herself, who, at least in the NA version, has to be at least 15 since her father's accident is stated to have been 15 years ago, and is more likely to be 17 or so, as she was "very young" at the time rather than "not born" or "just a baby"; and the player character, who joins the diving service while taking a break from courses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> runs on this trope in general. The main protagonists will usually be given a specific age; for example, Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em> are 16-18. Apart from that though, all bets are off. You can get some clues from support conversations, but hardly anyone else has their age directly stated, at least in-game.

We know Lucina is slightly older than most of the other children, as supports confirm she was born before them, and Laurent is physically three years older than her due to a time travel accident sending him back further into the past than the others, but other than that, nothing.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Branded</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Laguz</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em> age much slower than Beorcs (humans), with life spans ranging from a few centuries to a millennium depending on the specific tribe. Thus, they can be much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a>. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Micaiah</span> looks like a teenager, but is also old enough to have looked after the now-teenaged <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sothe</span> as he grew up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's later established that Micaiah was born prior to the Serenes Massacre, which gives her a minimum age of 23, while her inability to remember her origins gives her a maximum age of 27.</span> Even the companion books, which reveal the approximate ages of all the party members, only state how old the Laguz characters would be in equivalent human years.
</li><li> Kaze (and his twin brother Saizo) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> is old enough to have been deployed as a guard when the Avatar/Corrin was kidnapped, but young enough to have been considered "a child" when it happened. The kidnapping itself was "over a decade ago" according to Azura, making a lot of the Nohrian and Hoshidan nobles' ages hard to figure out, even the Avatar themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> allows you to check how old your party members are on any given day, with the exceptions of Byleth, Manuela, Seteth, and Flayn, whose ages are unrevealed. In the case of Byleth, it's only noted that they're barely older than their mostly teenage students, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though doing the math with the information revealed in their father's diary indicates that they're roughly 21 or so. The <em>Cindered Shadows</em> DLC corroborates this when Rhea explains that Byleth's mother died giving childbirth approximately 20 years ago</span>. Manuela deliberately conceals her age because she doesn't want to scare off potential suitors, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with data mining revealing that she's 34 pre-timeskip</span>. As for Seteth and Flayn, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're actually immortal descendants of the Goddess herself, with both being at least a millennia old</span>.

Token humans Polly Sparks and Jo Hammet are clearly a third grader and a fifth grader respectively. The original incarnations of Mr. Hopsalot and Frankie were obviously an adult rabbit and an adult dog. On the flip side, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimals">Funny Animals</a> in the 2001-2004 games play this trope straight. They all appear childlike, and this incarnation of Hopsalot mentions in Advanced 2nd Grade that finding clues "gives [him] an excuse to stay up past [his] bedtime". However, no parents are seen or even mentioned and they all seem really self-sufficient. The 1990s version of Jump Start Preschool also plays this trope straight; the featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimals">Funny Animals</a> speak in childlike voices, but Casey Cat wears a necktie, so it is difficult to tell whether they are supposed to be the students or the teachers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em>: Kirby was described in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">manual</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand">Kirby's Dream Land</a></em> to be a "little boy" but gave no age, and his age in games since then hasn't really been touched upon.
</li><li> The mascot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kogama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Kogama">Kogama</a> appears to be a young boy, helped by the fact that his name is Blockboy. However, his age was not confirmed. He has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> appearance (although some of the other characters with his body shape appear to be significantly older), so he looks to be in between the ages of 8-19.
</li><li> It says something that Link's age alone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> has spanned a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a> among fans:
<ul><li> Early in his series, Link's age was indeterminate, and his sprite had too little detail to tell. In-manual art drew him like Peter Pan with more hair, making it more unclear how old he actually was. The exception is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em>, where he is explicitly 16 years old (he's also the Link from the first game a few years later). Most of the later console games give him a more explicit age, but the handheld games are still vague. It wasn't until much later when Link in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend Of Zelda I</a></em> was confirmed to be 12 years old from the same source that stated that <em>Ocarina of Time</em> Link was 9 years old as a child (however the original Link has also been referred to as 10).
</li><li> Link in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> may be implied to be a prepubescent kid, not only by the AV Famicom commercial (which oddly promotes the cartridge port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend Of Zelda I</a></em>), but also by the GBA port of the game, where he is given young N64 Link's voice. This Link design also uses a "young Link" voice in <em>A Link to the Past</em> and in the <em>Link's Awakening</em> remake. His design, however, is more reminiscent of a teen in his early teens according to official art. The similarly aged Marin and Zelda are also depicted as looking teenage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> Link's age is never mentioned in the game itself, but while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the official strategy guide</a> pins him at twelve, the game itself states that Link starts his quest at the same age as Link from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> (9 as a child, 16 as an adult). The games that follow <em>The Wind Waker</em>, namely <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>, both made Link look rather young because of his chibi model.
</li><li> His age isn't stated, but is generally assumed to be between 9 and 16 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>, as he is younger than the 16-year-old model but it is stated to have been a while since the events of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, at the end of which he stayed 9.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> supplemental material confirms his age there as 17. He's the same age in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>, though Miyamoto had suggested during development that he would be even older.
</li><li> Link's age in <em>Ocarina of Time</em> is even this. Official sources have called young Link both 9 and 12. This would make his adult form either 16 or 18. The <em>Ocarina of Time</em> Link <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a> says he is 17. The in-game debug refers to young Link as <em>5</em> while his adult version is 17, which isn't accurate to the game as that's a 12-year difference (implying in development the timeskip was larger).
</li><li> Zelda herself is an oddity. Her age is never given but she rarely, if ever, seems too different in age than Link. <em>Twilight Princess</em> Zelda is the lone exception - supplemental material confirms her to be 20. This has not stopped fans from debating her age, however.
</li><li> Link and Zelda traditionally look the same age but Link in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em> and Zelda seem to have an age gap. Zelda looks like she's in her teens but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">Puni Plush</a> style could be at fault. Link looks and sounds like he's under 13, but his official art muddles his age by making him look like a teenager. The fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their darker counterpart's Hilda and Ravio seem more similarly aged despite Ravio sharing a slightly modified version of Link's model</span> makes things even vaguer.
</li><li> Link in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> is vague due to his androgynous looks and his babyface. He is described as not yet an adult, and he is too young to drink alcohol, but is also stated to at least be seventeen as he was able to climb Mount Lanayru, which in-universe is barred to anyone under seventeen. Not helping matters is the fact that that pod Link wakes up in? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was asleep in it for 100 years to recover from near fatal wounds</span>. Link can bring this up at a bar, but no one believes it, leading to the above.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> allows your character to marry (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">For NX, of course</a>), even if they look like they're not even close to maturity. Some of the quest givers give off the impression of being young (i.e. a student attending a magic school), but appear to be just as tall as your character and don't have a clear age either. In one quest line, you begin by playing hide and seek with children. A few levels later, you're fighting in a revolution.
</li><li> The player in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>. Steve/Alex is clearly an adult, or else they wouldn't be left alone or have a goatee (Pre-Beta Steve only, often thought of as a smile). In fact, it's also hard to estimate both's age range as well, given that everything in the game is pixelated. However, Alex looks fairly young. Steve may be too, but then again, their faces are pixelated, along with the rest of their bodies, meaning they are very hard to tell.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoshiMonsters">Moshi Monsters</a></em>: Lots of examples, due to the game's cartoony style. All the employed characters are adults, though the majority could be anywhere from their 20s to 50s, Simon Growl is bald but doesn't seem elderly, someone mentioned that he once had some grey hairs, but that could have been a lie and his "hair" is a sentient wig. Elder Furi and Dr Strangeglove went to university together and they're very old but <em>how</em> old exactly is unknown. Stacey Grace is a schoolgirl but her grade is unknown. Zack Binspin is called a "kid" by Blingo, but he lives alone, Mrs Snoodle has only just hatched out of her egg but her name implies that she's married, Auntie Wobbleson is old enough to be the aunt of an adult but she doesn't seem elderly. Lila Tweet and Pete Slurp are implied to be in school, but is that elementary school? Middle school? High school?
</li><li> A rather creepy example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em>, as nobody knows how old <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Porky Minch</span> is, not even the character in question. 1,000 years old? <em>10,000</em> years old? How long have they been traveling through time?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em>:
<ul><li> Adee walks around on her own, so she's probably an adult, but her exact age is unknown.
</li><li> King Altador, the Darkest Faerie, and Queen Fyora are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">more than a thousand years old</a> despite appearances, and were adults a thousand years ago. Marina and the Tooth Faerie are said to be the youngest faeries, but still very old.
</li><li> The player Neopets. They appear to be adults and can get jobs, but there's a Random Event where they lose teeth, and when a Draik is hatched from an egg, it still looks like an adult. There are Baby pets, but this is merely one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorWildlife">available pet "colors"</a> and thus seems purely aesthetic, as they are still capable of nearly everything that other pets are, from getting jobs to fighting in the Battledome - the only exception being that they, like Mutant pets, have unusual body types and thus can't wear normal clothing.
</li></ul></li><li> The CPUs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> are immortal goddesses, throwing any relevance of their exact age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">out the window</a> to start with, but there's still the question of how old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Rom and Ram</a> are intended to be. On one hand, they look about 10-12, can go out on Lowee's streets unsupervised, and have basic reading ability fitting that age. On the other, Rom still prefers to have picture books read to her and can't walk to the bathroom alone at night, and Ram boasts about being above such things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap">Night Trap</a></em>: A lot of characters do not have canon ages, although actress Dana Plato was not yet 23 when she played SCAT member Kelly Medd, who is pretty old enough to investigate the Martins' winery estate, though the other members call her a kid in the intro for the cancelled Control-Vision version (which is added for the 25th Anniversary Edition). Though there are four other adult actresses playing the roles of teenage girls, the actor playing the "kid brother" Danny (Joshua Godard) kinda looks like an adolescent boy. This is lampshaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Tyler Hogle</a> of Screaming Villains in an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df2zptiviBo">interview<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, when he says that he doesn't know Danny's age, but that people can interpret one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">deleted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> scenes as "a 12- or 13-year-old getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpromptuTracheotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpromptuTracheotomy">a drill in his neck</a>".

<ul><li> Among the playable characters, Soldier: 76 is the only one whose age is unknown. Fans usually put him at 55 because of a comment from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Word of Saint Paul</a>, but narration for the "Junkenstein's Revenge" in-game event mentions that he's about two decades older than McCree and Hanzo, who are 37 and 38, respectively.
</li><li> Reaper's age also used to be unknown, but promotional material eventually revealed he was 50 in an event that takes place 8 years in the past, making him 58 in the game's present day.

</li><li> Many in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>, especially the protagonists:
<ul><li> For a very long while, the only protagonist with a confirmed age was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Red</a>, who's 11 in the first games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">according to the manual</a> and presumably their remakes, presumably 14 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>, <em>Crystal</em>, and their remakes, at the very least 16-17 by the time of his reappearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite2">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White 2</a></em>, and has been stated to be in his early twenties in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, making him anywhere from 20 to 24 in these games. According to the same manual, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Blue</a> is the same age as Red, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Leaf</a> can be presumed to be the same age as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Wes</a> is stated to be around seventeen to eighteen, and Lucy Fleetfoot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonTrozei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonTrozei">Pok&eacute;mon Trozei!</a></em> is said to be just a bit older than him.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em> protagonists are stated to be older than previous heroes of the main series, but it's unknown by how many years.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bs7r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2bs7r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bs7r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that they were visualized to be sixteen</span> The sequel protagonists are even worse, looking younger than Hilda and Hilbert but older than characters like Red or May.
</li><li> Many people assume the player characters are around 10 thanks in part to the anime making Ash 10, but again, the only protagonists in the games with outright stated ages are a year older than that. Also, Michael is identified as "an unknown teen" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">Pok&eacute;mon XD: Gale of Darkness</a></em>, so he could be at least 13, yet he looks about the same as the characters from the main games (not to mention he's about a head shorter).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em> protags muddy these waters even further; thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a> feature of the games, their clothing and hairstyles can make them <em>look</em> older or younger. On one extreme, "cute" outfits can make them look like the ten-year-olds everyone associates with Ash and Misty (Serena even getting some Misty-like outfit options), while on the other end of the scale, outfits from Snowbelle or Lumiose can make them look like early college students. Even more confusing is that your character has to bend down to talk to young children, but not <em>all</em> children. A character, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emma</span>, who is roughly the protagonists' height is identified as being sixteen, and said character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a>. The protagonist is implied to be older than them as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> averts this with many characters, as the news you see on the Pok&eacute;Nav confirms ages for several characters (for example Wally is 10 and Professor Birch is 35). The protagonists' age is still mysteriously absent despite the news discussing them quite often. However, due to the unselected player character being indicated as 12, the player can be presumed to be 12 as well.
</li><li> There is also a set of protagonists with a confirmed age, and in-game at that; the unnamed protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em>, who are 11, just like Red was at the start of his journey. This is confirmed by Wicke asking you at one point if you are "around eleven", with both dialogue options basically amounting to "yes".
</li><li> The <em>Pokemon</em> games never keep track of the ages of individual Pokemon, making it impossible to tell how old it is. Evolution is also not an indication of age, as they can evolve whenever the correct trigger is hit, and can easily prevent it from occuring. The closest thing to aging is that Baby Pokemon are incapable of breeding unless they evolve into a higher form and even that means little because only a select few Pokemon are considered "Baby Pokemon".
</li><li> Many younger NPCs are this way. For example, Misty seems to be around Red's age judging from an early Gen 1 art of them together and adaptations portraying them as the same age, but Misty's post-timeskip design arguably looks older than Red.
</li><li> The Alola games have Hapu and Gladion. Hapu's short height and proportions makes her look far younger than the protagonist, but trainers in Alola go on journeys at eleven and she has the vocabulary of someone at least eleven as well. Gladion is presumably 11-year old Lillie's older brother but their age gap isn't clarified. Lillie is slightly taller than Gladion and he's still a child, so the age difference isn't too large. Some fans even interpret them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfIdenticalTwins">Half-Identical Twins</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> While Luke has his age confirmed in the series, there's no clear answer to how old Flora is in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton">Professor Layton</a></em> games. The first game, where she's introduced, offers the only clue; her late father left explicit instructions that an heir to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWealth">Impossibly Cool Wealth</a> was not to be sought until Flora was "out of childhood." All we know for sure is that she's older than Luke but still young enough to require a legal guardian. Most players estimate her to be between fourteen and seventeen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuyoPuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuyoPuyo">Puyo Puyo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some characters do not have canon ages, but Witch has been given two different canon ages (13 in Sun and 15 in ~n respectively) and yet her appearance in <em>Madou Monogatari ARS</em> would indicate she is much older, closer to 180.

</li><li> Lemres and Ms. Accord from the <em>Fever</em> series both canonically use anti-aging magic to remain young and dialogue referring to their ages is deliberately vague as to what that age actually is, making it hard to ascertain their true ages. Lemres is described as a senior in school but it is also implied he and Accord are old friends, while Accord is a middle school teacher.

<ul><li> Callie and Marie look older than the playable Inklings but aren't specified (it isn't even stated if they're the same age or not), though it's implied they're old enough to drive. Considering they're idols, it's unlikely that they're older than their mid twenties.
</li><li> Off the Hook are the only characters in the entire series to have confirmed ages: Pearl is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">21</a> and Marina is 18. Prior to that, it was anyone's guess what age Pearl was. She has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a> personality and a very childish look but is an inkling and is treated adult.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon">Spyro the Dragon</a></em>: Spyro is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> but his age is never specified. According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a></em>, dragon eggs hatch once every twelve years, so he could be twelve.
</li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons">Story of Seasons</a></em> games tend to be this:
<ul><li> One of the few games where all of the characters have defined ages is the "Forget-Me-Not Valley" series of games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAWonderfulLife">A(nother) Wonderful Life</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS">DS (Cute)</a></em>), where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the manual</a> gives the characters' ages. This can be especially confusing given that there are certain characters who state that they're older than the protagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">especially when they're romanced</a>, but who look exactly the same as everyone else due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">the cutesy art style.</a> A prime example is Muffy, who is in her early thirties but looks as young as the twenty-somethings. Celia and Nami look like they're in their early twenties as well, despite being in their late twenties; Celia is so youthful that it's even noted in-universe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">she ages well</a>.
</li><li> Luna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonTreeOfTranquility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonTreeOfTranquility">Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility</a></em> is so short she resembles the other children on the island, but is of marriageable age. This naturally caused a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>, so in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade">Harvest Moon: Animal Parade</a></em>, she got a height boost. She's still on the younger side, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">the way she dresses</a>, but how <em>much</em> so still isn't clear.
</li><li> Calvin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonTreeOfTranquility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonTreeOfTranquility">Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonAnimalParade">Harvest Moon: Animal Parade</a></em> is an especially confusing case. When romanced, he alludes to there being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">age difference</a> between him and the protagonist. However, his character profile explicitly refers to him as a <em>young</em> man. Either the protagonist is really, really young, or she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">older than she looks.</a>
</li><li> Soseki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonANewBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonANewBeginning">Harvest Moon: A New Beginning</a></em> is another odd case. He also alludes to being decently older than the protagonist. However, most of the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox">Silver Fox</a> bachelors in the series had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAnatomyAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAnatomyAging">Animation Anatomy Aging</a> to indicate them being older&mdash;Soseki doesn't. This leads to the common fan theory that he's not that old at all, but he's <em>extremely</em> self-conscious about it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypochondria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypochondria">It wouldn't be out of character.</a>
</li><li> Ann from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64">Harvest Moon 64</a></em> and other future games looks like a teenager but can be married.
</li><li> All of the bachelorettes from <em>Harvest Moon 64</em> count. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Japanese Famitsu strategy guide</a> to the game gives the ages of everyone <em>but</em> the bachelorettes and the protagonist.
</li><li> Nina from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon1">Harvest Moon</a></em> looks absurdly young in the official art and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">more</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">childish</a> persona than even the neighborhood kids, but apparently is an adult. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonMagicalMelody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonMagicalMelody">Harvest Moon: Magical Melody</a></em> remedies this by making her look like someone who is at least eighteen, despite the chibi art style, and the English translation removing her use of her name as a pronoun.
</li><li> This is averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonSaveTheHomeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonSaveTheHomeland">Harvest Moon: Save The Homeland</a></em>. All the major characters have known ages. For example, Toy (the protagonist) is twenty-one while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a> Katie is sixteen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonIslandOfHappiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonIslandOfHappiness">Harvest Moon: Island of Happiness</a></em> has Pierre. He outright looks like a ten year but is apparently of marriage age.
</li><li> Both Fritz and Mistel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons2014">Story of Seasons (2014)</a></em> look quite young but can still be married and aren't treated like kids.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SubwaySurfers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SubwaySurfers">Subway Surfers</a></em> has a soft, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">Puni Plush</a> style and features the characters illegally jumping around dangerous train tracks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow">in the middle of the day</a>. It's hard to tell what age several characters are. They all sort of look like tweens, though some like Lucy and Tasha are designed a bit older looking and several female characters dress in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">midriff showing</a> outfits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Princess Peach. In the games (especially in her 3D appearances) she has a decidedly mature physique and is even taller than Luigi; however, in the western comics she acts more like a tomboyish tween, and her relationship with Mario seems to be one of childish infatuation, with the "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3">The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseBible">Writers Bible</a>" calling her a seventeen-year-old (albeit this was never mentioned in the series proper and seems to have been made up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment">DiC Entertainment</a>). Her original design in her first appearance resembled a child, so that is probably the cause of the discrepancy, and she was likely aged up for the second game to be a closer match to Mario as a result. Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, the Shadow Queen refers to her as a "child" (though the Shadow Queen is a 1000 year old demon and could be using "child" metaphorically).
</li><li> This also applies to Mario, Luigi and Bowser. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime">Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</a></em> shows the three, plus Peach, as infants; yet in their adult years, Peach hasn't lost her youthful look. The Mario brothers are implied to still be in their twenties, and they're just a bit older than her.
</li><li> Mario was confirmed as approximately 26 in his Japanese trophy description for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Melee</em>, and Miyamoto confirmed in 2016 that he is about 24 or 25; either way, he is estimated to be in his mid-twenties. Luigi is his twin brother (but born after him) so he is the same age. Peach and Bowser still remain a mystery, but since Peach couldn't even walk as an infant in <em>Partners in Time</em> and Bowser could talk as an infant, which the baby Mario Bros. can and can't do, respectively, Peach is implied to be a year or so younger and Bowser a year or so older.
</li><li> Yoshi. The official voice was introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisStory">Yoshi's Story</a></em> for a group of Yoshi infants, yet in later games, the same voice is used for its grown form. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>, it gets even weirder as the Yoshi there apparently hatches out of the egg with vague knowledge of the world ("Is that one of those 'kiss' things? I've go to get me one of those!") and no name, but talks like a teenage punk and generally acts like an adult.
</li><li> Kamek. He's presumably pretty old given how he was an adult back in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em> series (and is still around now), but how old? Who knows, he hasn't even changed design in the 20 odd year time skip. Only thing that ever changed for him was the colour of his robe and wizard hat (and by one shade of a blue at that). There is, however, the possibility that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a>, as he's pretty interchangeable with his Magikoopa kind (even sharing the same name in Japanese materials, which tend to not distinguish between alike individuals of a given species).
</li><li> Rosalina. She looks to be in her 20's or <em>maybe</em> early thirties, but visits the Mushroom Kingdom <em>every 100 years</em>. She is implied to be immortal, but that doesn't explain why she physically appears younger in the optional flashback story.
</li><li> Vivian from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>. She's stated to be the youngest of the Shadow Sirens, and acts like a teenage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a>, however her elder sister must be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>at least</em> over 1000 years old, as Beldam is recognized by the Shadow Queen who has been sealed for as long</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSizedFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSizedFamily">Super Sized Family</a></em> has no official ages for the characters, but there are some clues:
<ul><li> The player character is old enough to be the parent of a teen and some younger kids, meaning they're probably somewhere in their thirties or forties.
</li><li> Torri is explicitly a teen, although her exact age is not mentioned.
</li><li> Christian and Duncan are both older than the toddlers and probably not teens, although they could be anywhere between five and twelve, and it's hard to tell who's the oldest of the two or if they're twins.
</li><li> Virginia and Sullivan are both somewhere between two and four, and again, they might be twins or one might be slightly older than the other.
</li><li> Jessica and Jonathan are babies and each have one tooth and can sit up on their own, making them anywhere between six months and a year old. They're <em>probably</em> twins, but it's never stated.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SurvivorFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SurvivorFire">Survivor: Fire</a></em>, the only things we know about the ages of the characters is that Gran is elderly, Mom and Dad are adults and not elderly, Brother is about four at the <em>absolute youngest</em> and seventeen at the <em>absolute oldest</em>, and Sister is probably younger than Brother, but not a baby.
</li><li> Usually this isn't an issue with main characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em>, but Judas's age is a problem. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Leon was 16 when he died</span>, and Judas still looks young, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> considering he was revived at some undetermined point between the Eye of Atamoni incident and the present</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny2">Tales of Destiny 2</a></em>, and he's treated like the old guy of the group, he could be anywhere from 16 to 34.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TellingLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TellingLies">Telling Lies</a></em>: the central character, David, claims to be 28 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for his cover story</span>; however, some facts of his biography make it clear that he's older, probably a thirtysomething. The actor playing him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoganMarshallGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoganMarshallGreen">Logan Marshall-Green</a>, was in his early forties at the time of filming.
</li><li> The questionable art skills of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>'s creator ZUN have made the intended age of most characters unfathomable from their official portraits. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stays extremely vague on the subject, this has left the fandom free rein on their age. Even more than the others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl">Orin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">Patchouli</a> (who wears baggy clothes) have fallen victims to this trope, alternating between cute girls and fully grown women, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a>. Even limiting it to the humans, whose ages presumably matter more, it's extremely unclear how old Marisa and Reimu are supposed to be, with the range often being given as things like 10-20. And even if their precise age is given at one point, it's unclear if they're aging or not. If each change of the seasons indicates a year passing in-story, they'd be somewhere in their 20s by now. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> example comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Sakuya</a>, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a> powers. Though she's been described in-game as looking to be in her late teens or early twenties, she displays skills and knowledge far beyond someone of that age, and her boss Remilia has said that Sakuya's been serving her so long that it's hard to think of her as a human being anymore. Since one game shows her demonstrating the ability to accelerate an object's aging (making a bamboo flower bloom instantly rather than the 60 years it normally takes), it's generally assumed that she has the corresponding ability to <em>de</em>celerate aging as well, which would explain her appearance perfectly.
</li><li> Many characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>:
<ul><li> The protagonist is never given an age but is explicitly referred to as a child and their sprite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedKid">makes them look quite small</a>. This could mean they're anywhere between five and twelve years old.
</li><li> Papyrus collects action figures, believes in Santa, wears an armor costume, sleeps in a racecar bed, dates the aforementioned protagonist if they choose to flirt with him, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">rather loud and eccentric</a>. Yet he is very tall, has a job, is old enough to join the Royal Guard and keeps Sans in line <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and is elected as ruler of The Underground <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">depending on who's available</a></span>. Many fans just assume he's a teenager or a manchild. This is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Monster Kid if you talk to him after fighting Papyrus:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Monster Kid:</strong> I wonder if that weird skeleton is an adult or a kid.
</div><ul><li> Muffet is described by her creator as "a lil' baby spider monster", but she looks to be way older than infancy, runs her own bake sale, and addresses the game's protagonist as "deary", a term of affection more often used towards younger people. This description was evidently meant to be figurative in reference to her cute design and not literal, so Muffet's real age is anyone's guess.
</li><li> Monsters' ages in general are hard to pinpoint. While <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Toriel and Asgore</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">do not age</a>, it is unclear if/how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreWeird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMonstersAreWeird">monsters age and mature in accordance with humans</a>. Many of them do act naive and childish, however.
<ul><li> The characters' ages may be hinted at by their handles on UnderNet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">Papyrus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPerson">Undyne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">Napstablook</a>'s usernames are CoolSkeleton95, StrongFish91 and NAPSTABLOOK22 respectively. If this is refering to their birthyear, that will place Papyrus around 15-24, Undyne around 19-28 and Napstablook 88-97 years old depending on what time of the year they were born and when the game takes place. The Fallen child arrives in the underground in the year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearX">201X</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the game takes place during an unspecified time period afterwards<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3m7w2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3m7w2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3m7w2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The year Frisk arrives in is referred to 201<strong>x</strong>, not 201<strong>X</strong>, implying that it's a different year, but within the same decade</span></span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Some of the characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a></em> series fall into this. Ashley's the most obvious example (her 'official' age is supposedly around 15 according to the US website, and unstated in Japan), and her design is so vague that it's kind of hard to tell what age the character is outside of 'looks fairly young'. Same deal with 18-Volt, who looks like anything between a high school student and adult, who's somehow still in elementary school, in the same class as the much younger-looking 9-Volt.
</li><li> Amareus of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion">Yggdra Union</a></em> is one of only a handful of characters in the game whose age is not explicitly stated somewhere or other. Instead, the official website gives the viewer a ballpark-estimate quote: She's "2? years old".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has an example that almost creates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a>: Despite being a major character Sylvanas Windrunner has never had her age or birthdate stated.

There are some sources that suggest she was alive during the Troll Wars, which would make her at least 2800 years old or so. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4qz6w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4qz6w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4qz6w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's possible the references to her fighting trolls aren't acutally refering to the Troll Wars, but some smaller and more recent conflict, or at least have been retconned to refer to that </span> However, <em>Edge Of Night</em> seems to contradict this, as she is said to be a promising hunter at only age 20, and while "promising hunter" is a long way from "Ranger General", it probably didn't take thousands of years. As such, she could be anywhere from late 20s to hundreds of years old.

(The parent is implied to be middle aged from the wrinkles around their eyes.)</span> Before this, in the absence of other rabbits to compare them to, the bunny was basically ageless.

The cartoonish art style doesn't help matters. However, it is possible to extrapolate from their statements about graduating high school and the assumptions people on other worlds make about their youth, and they got a visual (though again not textual) age-up between chapters 5 and 6.
</li><li> Cucumber and his sister Almond of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CucumberQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CucumberQuest">Cucumber Quest</a></em> are, in the author's own words, "A young kid and a slightly younger kid." It is known that Cucumber isn't 9, because that's how old his father thinks he is.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThePetriDish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ThePetriDish">The Petri Dish</a></em>, one strip has Thaddeus Euphemism's age said to be thirty-seven, but another strip has Bob point out that he's turning forty. So either, three years have passed in-universe, Bob got Thaddeus's age wrong, or "turning forty" means he's simply close to forty.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Polandball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Polandball">Polandball</a></em>: Though countries are assumed to be old as their real-life counterparts, its left deliberate how old they are: for example, the United Kingdom is traditionally considered one of the senior countries in comic, while his "son" USA is depicted as an adult or teen, even though most countries are shown as the same age including Russia (who is naturally older than the USA in real life). Sweden and Norway are also about as old as Britain, and Greece and Egypt is <em>older than all of them</em>, yet they aren't considered as seniors. It gets even weirder when you even begin factoring strips tend to vary as whether a country taking on a new regime (like Prussia becoming the German Empire then Nazi Germany to West/East Germany to just plain Germany) counts as the same nation throughout or is a child of the previous incarnation. Or whether Israelball represents the country (one of the youngest in the world) or the Jewish population in general (which stretches through out history).
</li><li> The author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em> has confessed that he has no idea how old General Tagon is, guessing that he's somewhere between 18 and 40 years older than his 49 year-old son.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest">Sinfest</a></em> is pretty weird with this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Slick is somewhere between 14 and his early twenties, and the other characters rarely (if ever) get their ages touched upon. It's especially weird considering that most of the main male characters look considerably younger than the women (who all look somewhere from their late teens to twenties). It's not helped by the fact that just about every character lives on their own.
</li><li> Sock from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WelcomeToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WelcomeToHell">Welcome to Hell</a></em>. He looks like a preteen but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that he is 15-20.

The sixth episode shows a picture of Red Guy in a cap and gown with a diploma and implies that he works at an office, suggesting that he is at least a young adult.

Her actress in the webseries is a short adult, but she also hints to still be going to class in some of her dialogue.

Despite the name "Babies" the character Bunny claims to have gone to high school and even had several wives (to which the character Puppy says, "Shit man, how old are you?").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>:

The cutoff agd for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being a Maiden</span> is 30, which means Cinder can't be over 30 as of Volume 3.
</li><li> Neo is young enough looking to infiltrate the school as a high school student but other than that is very vague looking (no thanks to her short height and youthful design). The age gap between her and Roman is hard to distinguish; they could be years apart as easily as they could be the same age.
</li><li> Ruby's and Yang's ages when Summer died are vague. Ruby's image song "Red Like Roses Part II" implies she was old enough to grasp it and she remembers Summer well, but in-series Yang says that Ruby was too young to understand Summer's death and couldn't talk yet. Yang also says that she had to pick up the pieces after their mother died, which is an odd thing for a 4-6 year old to do. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RWBY2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RWBY2019">RWBY (2019)</a></em> depicts Yang missing her front teeth (which happens between 6-8) after Summers death.

Even he isn't sure of his age. In the episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthdayEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthdayEpisode">Jeffy's Birthday!</a>", the only evidence of Jeffy's age is a half-torn piece of paper in his pants pocket, which has the day he was born (August 21) written on it, but not the year. This was soon averted with a couple of his birthday episodes saying he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> 12 (<em>Jeffy's Parents</em>) and is 14 (<em>Jeffy's Birthday Surprise</em>)</span>, however, this does call into his sister, Feebee's age, into question, as, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was</span> younger than Jeffy but it's not said how much younger.
</li><li> Doki and Nabi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ThereSheIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ThereSheIs">There she is!!</a></em> are hard to place. On one hand, they are shorter and look a lot younger and more childlike compared to their friends who are clearly adults. Yet on the other hand, both of them seem to live alone, Nabi has a job delivering news papers, and Doki can apparently buy plane tickets.

His childhood friend claimed to have been a teenager for decades at one point and when questioned <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it is revealed that Cecil can't actually remember what year they graduated. And considering they both sound around the same age, that only raises more questions. Also despite having memories of growing up in Night Vale, a "Best Of" episode reveals that his first show recounted a group of settlers arriving at a barren wasteland and declaring that they will found a town there called Night Vale, and a later one has him excitedly telling listeners about a new technology called radio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">that people will soon be able to listen to his show on</a>.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a></em> cartoon, the Fab Four themselves are in their moptop-era designs, meaning they're meant to be very young adults. However, a few episodes have them refer to themselves as teenagers, and yet another episode has them at a legal drinking age. It should be noted that it is possible to be all three simultaneously in Britain, where 18 is the drinking age and the age when one becomes an adult.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop">Betty Boop</a> appears to be an adult or young adult, but in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MinnieTheMoocher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MinnieTheMoocher">Minnie the Moocher</a>" she is running away from home because her parents grounded her when she didn't eat her peas. She is implied to be a teenager, and she can be between 16 and 19 in most shorts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens">Beverly Hills Teens</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chester McTech is younger than most of the cast, but by how much is never specified.
</li><li> Whilshire looks like a teenager like the rest of the cast, but he's almost never seen attending school with them and apparently has a full time job as a valet/chauffeur. This was most likely done to make his crush on the obviously teenage Bianca less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a>.

Joe acts immature like a kid but lives alone and is played by an adult. There's also Blue, who has her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstDayOfSchoolEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstDayOfSchoolEpisode">First Day of School Episode</a> but one episode reveals that her puppyhood was years ago.

Ms. Marmalady looks like she could be at least 30. Averted with Cricket who says she's six years old in a few episodes.
</li><li> The chalk drawing characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone">ChalkZone</a></em> are technically as old as when they were first drawn (for example, Snap turns two in "Lost in Chalk" because it marked two years since Rudy first drew him), but most of their physical/mental ages are still left vague. While Snap lives on his own and has been shown driving in a few episodes, he appears to be around eight to ten physically and mentally.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> qualify, most notably Gadget Hackwrench. The closest the series ever gets to specifying the characters' ages is that two episodes imply that Monterey Jack is much older than Gadget, Chip, Dale, and Zipper. His character design also suggests this, as he's considerably taller than the others, heavyset, and mustachioed.

They're typically to be portrayed as adults, Goofy even has a son, but some merchandise and cartoons can easily portray them as students without changing much of anything. Of course even when they're portrayed as adults their ages are hard to pin down. Goofy is old enough to have the aforementioned college aged son and was shown to be an adult in 70s according to <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em> (which was a turn-of-the-century film), but Mickey and Donald seem much younger than that most of the time. Most of the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> is portrayed as an adult, however one short "Donald's Better Self" depicts him as a child.

</li><li> Ember from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> has been suggested to be have died in her twenties according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, despite her general persona and appearance seeming more like a rebellious high schooler, and despite Mr. Lancer calling her a "teen idol" in her first appearance. Fans typically interpret the claim of her not being a teenager as being an attempt by the show's creator to discourage people from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shipping</a> Ember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">with Danny</a>, rather than an accurate statement. The confusion is added when the creator would suggest years later she is secretly in love with the 14 year old hero.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveyAndGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveyAndGoliath">Davey and Goliath</a></em>: Davey, or any of the other characters, never have their ages mentioned. In the earlier 1960's episodes, Davey looked to be about 9-12, but in the 1970's series, he appeared to be around 12-14. We know he is younger than high school age, thanks to the episodes "The Stopped Clock", where Davey is a waterboy for the local high school's baseball team, and "Rickety-Rackety", where a boy who was failing french (The fact that they study french indicates that they are in middle school) says "Anyhow, my dad said he didn't have to take french until high school!" However, in "School, Who Needs It!" Davey and friends only have one teacher, suggesting they are in elementary school, but it is very possible they go to a K-8 school where each grade only has one teacher, judging by the fact their school is simply called Palmview School, not Palmview Elementary School or Palmview Middle/Junior High School. In the 1972 Davey and Goliath educational film "The Family of God", Davey takes his first communion, and the average age for Lutherans to start communing is fifth grade. However, it seems like a no-brainer for the Lutheran church to use popular children's characters that they owned in their first communion film, and the show was already running for 11 years when the episode was made, so this doesn't necessarily indicate the age of the characters. Furthermore, in the 1960's episode "Happy Landing", Davey's neighbor brings him to his job as a air traffic controller at a commercial airport. When the neighbor gets jokingly asked if Davey is a new pilot, he replies "Give Davey 12 more years and he will be up there flying in that plane." We don't know how old you needed to be to fly a commercial plane in the 60's, but if it was still 18 like it is now, that would suggest Davey was 6 in that series. However, if you need a Airline Transport Pilot license, you have to be 23, suggesting the more likely possibility that Davey was 11 in the 60's series.
</li><li> Gwizdo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonHunters">Dragon Hunters</a></em>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> (which was a prequel to the series) he's established as a homeless adult; in the series he lives in an inn and has apparently been staying there since the innkeeper's daughter Zoria (who is around 18 now) was a child, which would mean that he's quite old. Yet appearance-wise he barely looks over 20 and in "The Isle of Mist" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he ends up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">Fountain of Youth</a> for a few seconds he immediately reverts to a young child even though the monks before him had to bathe in it for several minutes just to revert to their thirties</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> does this for their adult cast members. In official materials, the ages of most of the teenage cast are explicitly given, but for their parents, who should be somewhere between their mid-thirties to early fifties, their ages are given as "Dad-ish" or "Aunt-ish".
</li><li> HBO Family sometimes airs a show called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElPerroYElGato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElPerroYElGato">El Perro Y El Gato</a></em>.

<ul><li> The fairies are immortal and have been alive for millions of years, however it's unsure how old most of the characters are in "human" terms, as well as physically and mentally, through Cosmo and Wanda come off as 30-somethings. Also, Tootie's age seems to be a bit debated. In one tie-in book from 2004, she's stated to be eight (making her two years younger than Timmy). However in some material, she's stated to be ten.
</li><li> Princess Mandie of Boudacia. She's trying to marry Prince Mark Chang, who desires Vicky, a 16 year old. Mark also once tried to hit on Trixie Tang, who is <em>not</em> a teenager. Also, both Cosmo and King Chang were attracted to her despite both being married adults.

</li><li> The exact age of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCat">Felix the Cat</a> is never made clear, with the ambiguity of it most notable in the Trans-Lux television series, where he is depicted as living on his own and being trusted by the Professor to look after his nephew Poindexter, but is occasionally referred to as a kid.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FlipTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FlipTheFrog">Flip the Frog</a></em> has a different age in different episodes. Sometimes he's portrayed as a kid, sometimes as an adult.

On this, Zummi is clearly the older and Grammi is sometimes referred by non-gummis as &#147;the Old Lady Bear&#148;, although she and Zummi were cubs at the same time and friends in their childhood so probably have similar ages. Tummi is in his late teens or is a young adult as he is often seeing playing with the cubs but is treated more closely to an adult (one episode has exactly this as the conflict, as Tummi feels he is considered too young to be trustworthy but too old to be allow to play like the cubs), Zunni is in her early teens, Cubby is a pre-teen (and both are considered &#147;cubs&#148; although Zunni is treated accordingly to her adolescent status) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthRanger">The Sixth Ranger</a> Gusto is according to Tummi from his same age but is mentally more mature.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5bd09');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5bd09" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5bd09');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Probably because he had to survive on his own on an island for twelve years.</span>

</li><li> None of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> main characters have confirmed ages. All that is noted is that Kimber is the youngest and the others are somewhere in their twenties. The series bible states Kimber is three years younger than Jerrica but that doesn't say much. We never see her show signs of being in high school so we can assume she already graduated and is either eighteen or nineteen. The IDW <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JemAndTheHolograms">comic reboot</a> averts this trope by clearly showing ages in the character bios.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the ages of the main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em> are purposely left vague in order to allow a bigger range of stories. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Heloise</a> looks like a little girl, but holds down a job as Misery Inc's top inventor, and all three live without parental supervision.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em>: Henry and June's ages are never stated in the show, but appearance wise, most likely nine to eleven, most fans put them at ten.
</li><li> The entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>, except for Stumpy, who is ten.

Her relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr. Drakken</a> (who is Kim's father's age) flipped between father-daughter and romantic, even though she had a one-episode romance with Senor Senior Junior, who is apparently young enough to crush on Kim and date her high-school rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Bonnie</a>. The series bible stated she was 25 (though it features many non-canon elements) and the person that designed Shego states that she was designed as a 30-32 year old. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that she was in her mid-20s by the end of the show.
</li><li> The ages of Kim and Ron (and by extension, their fellow students) are also never really addressed beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> describing them as "high school age". Although given a few details throughout the series (moving to senior year, being able to drive, graduating etc.) it can be reasonably assumed that they start out in the series at 14/15, before ending up at 17/18 in the final season.
</li><li> Shego's youngest brother, the Wego twins, add onto her vague age by being vaguely aged themselves. They seem around the same age as Tim and Jim, if not a bit older, yet have apparently been superheroes for a while. They also received their powers at the same time as the rest of their family.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kion and Kiara are not littermates but appear to be of similar ages, despite Kiara explicitly being older. Kion has a tuft of mane growing already and has gotten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTalk">The Talk</a> however both siblings have the same generic 'cub' design.
</li><li> Fuli looks like a cub but is apparently old enough to have left her mother (unless her mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">died</a>). She lives alone and hunts alone.
</li><li> Bunga is obviously young but flashbacks show him even younger when he was taken in by Timon and Pumbaa.
</li><li> Vitani, Kovu, and Nuka all feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise">Role Reprises</a> from their movie. The problem is that Kovu uses his <em>adult</em> voice but has his cub design. The impression is that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">a preteen with a grown man's voice</a>. Some fans have theorized that he is in his early teens though and that he looks a bit older. This only makes Kiara's age more vague as she seems older than Kion, also uses the cub design, but is younger than Kovu.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittleBear">Little Bear</a></em>, Little Bear is around 5 years old&#151;he has a birthday early in the series&#151;and Emily turns 7 at one point. They are both regarded as young children and live with their adult guardians, and Little Bear is voiced by an actress who was ten when the show began. However, all of Little Bear's forest friends live by themselves and are voiced by adults, but unlike Emily's Granny or Little Bear's parents and grandparents, they fall victim to the same childish misconceptions as Little Bear, spend all day playing the same pretend games, and in general have as much to learn as Little Bear. The confirmed adults (Granny and the parent and grandparent Bears) treat Cat, Hen, Duck, and Owl as children, not as fellow adults.
<ul><li> Hen and Owl in particular sometimes act more like adults (though this may be due to their more pompous personalities), and Hen is an aunt, so she must have a sibling old enough to have chicks.
</li><li> When Little Bear and Duck recall their first meeting, he was only slightly younger and she was a recently hatched duckling, so Duck must be younger than Little Bear, who had not been a baby for years. When Little Bear recalls meeting Owl, he and Owl both look the same as they do now.
</li></ul></li><li> In his earliest cartoons, Porky Pig fluctuated between being a child and being an adult. The latter is easier to relate to, considering his future mild-mannered personality compared to the other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> characters.

<ul><li> Carlitos is a toddler and some sources put him at one (like Lily) and others at two.
</li><li> Rosa is old enough to be the grandmother of two seventeen-year-olds, making her 53 at the youngest (if Bobby and Carlota were born when their parents were eighteen and she in turn had Maria and Carlos when she was eighteen, which seems pretty unlikely, so she's probably older) but she hasn't gone grey yet. Similarly, Myrtle is dating Pop-Pop (who's explicitly old) but she hasn't gone grey yet.
</li><li> Carl's age is said to be six in one source, but eight in another.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Maisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Maisy">Maisy</a></em> the characters, a cute female mouse and her friends, go where they want, do what they want, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalDriversLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalDriversLicense">drive cars, fly planes</a>, take their own baths, etc. Really, there's nothing explicitly indicating that they aren't adults, other than their very childlike appearance, childlike babble speech and tendency to play with toys and stuffed animals (not that adults don't ever do that last one, of course.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegAndMog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegAndMog">Meg And Mog</a></em>: Mog is a fully grown cat and Meg is an adult (although she could be anywhere from her 20s to her 50s.) Owl, however, can fly, but he goes to school. Then again, it's possible that owls in this series start their education as adults.
</li><li> The members of Dethklok on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> are of a vague adult age. In the first season, Pickles is said to have run away from home 15 years ago at the age of 16, which makes him 31. However, he also played in a hair metal band in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. If he was, say, 19 in 1985, that makes him 40 when the series begins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MikeLuAndOg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MikeLuAndOg">Mike, Lu &amp; Og</a></em>: Mike's age is unstated, but looks to be around 10 to 12.

Sweetheart was the only aversion, celebrating her tenth birthday in "Happy Birthday, Sweetheart".
</li><li> The main cast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> are generally assumed to be anywhere from older teens at the youngest and late twenty-somethings at oldest. They all live independently and most work professionally, but also engage in activities such as slumber parties, and their interactions with explicitly pre-adolescent characters vacillate between older sibling and responsible adult figure. This isn't helped by the show's unexplained time scale of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microts">moons</a>", which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> pointed out on one occasion would depend on several factors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">that they don't really care about</a> in order to actually nail down.
<ul><li> Spike, who is several years younger than the rest of the main cast but still <em>older</em> than the other children in the show. He lives with Twilight Sparkle and is eventually confirmed to be her younger brother in the final season, but unlike the other young characters, he can be left on his own for long periods of time (even taking over another's duties), and has a job as Twilight's assistant rather attend school. All the while still being considered a "baby" dragon and sounding like a child or young teen. He starts molting and then grows wings in Season 8, which is treated similarly to puberty, further implying he's physically in his late preteens or early teens. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that Spike is a teen/young adult in pony years, but a pre-teen in dragon years and "<a class="urllink" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--PL3nsnlO3U/Vx3hONJb1_I/AAAAAAACj4g/_YY8zPsMT7wUhdVvmRXB2TMXITBMgL3_ACLcB/s1600/Capture.JPG">at least 7 - 10 years younger than Twilight in 'pony years'.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>"
</li><li> This is even worse for supporting and background characters, with whom the writers care little about episode-to-episode consistency. The ones you might assume are all about the some age when in the present day may be either adults <em>or</em> foals in flashbacks. Cheerilee is one such example, having been shown through flashbacks to be anywhere from the same age as the main characters to as old as Twilight's older brother.
</li><li> There's also the Cutie Mark Crusaders. They're significantly older than five, as shown in "For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils", and talk about how they're not little kids anymore, yet are clearly not teenagers.
</li><li> The Cake twins, Pound and Pumpkin, inexplicably stop wearing diapers, even though they were born in "Baby Cakes" and everyone supposedly only aged a year over the course of the series.

K.O. in particular is repeatedly referred to as being "six to eleven years old". In one episode, upon learning that his mom gave up being a superhero "6-11 years ago," K.O. gasps "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSelfContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSelfContradiction">That's exactly how old I am</a>!"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PegPlusCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PegPlusCat">Peg + Cat</a></em>: In "Peg Meets Cat", it's revealed that Peg met Cat when he was a kitten and she was a semi-verbal toddler. This happened explicitly four years ago (Tessa was nine and she's thirteen now), meaning Peg is five or six and Cat is four (which is an adult in cat years), however, in "The Big Dog Problem", Cat states that he is growing (though he could possibly be referring to psychological growth). There's also Richard, who's younger than Peg but not a baby, making him anywhere between two and five, and Ramone. Ramone is older than Peg and works jobs, but is not an adult. He could possibly be a teen, but he's not part of The Teens. In "I Do What I Can: the Musical", they do a play about Ramone having to do thirty good deeds before he's ten, which possibly suggests he's ten or younger, but it's hard to say.
</li><li> Who knows how old any of the penguins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> are? It's worth noting that apparently Private is younger than the rest (but interestingly had at least one earlier identity as the Mini Golf champion Mr. Tux). We're given a clue that Skipper and company weren't alive, or at least were not yet adults, in the 1960s as Skipper wants to go back in time and slap a hippie. Skipper recalls an adventure where he woke up in a bed covered in Deutchmarks (the German currency that was discontinued by 2002). It's also worth noting that Buck Rockgut had been down in the tunnel under the zoo for forty-seven years when the penguins found him, and that it's implied that he's much older than they are. That's around twice a normal penguin's natural lifespan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> has a flashback to the time when Skipper, Rico, and Kowalski meet a newborn Private. The character designs of the very young penguins reflects the fact that they themselves were definitely not yet adults at the time and have not yet begun their adventuring. But then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> indicates that the movies are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title characters, as well as their friends, were originally supposed to be nine years (as mentioned in the pilot), but when the creators saw how well various age groups responded to them they decided they were simply "less than fifteen" (in other words, younger than Candace). It's hard to get any clearer an example from how they act: Phineas is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">Cheerful Child</a> who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">Oblivious to Love</a>, while Ferb sounds like a teenager and has hints of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert">Covert Pervert</a>.
</li><li> In "Quantum Boogaloo", they travel twenty years into the future, and future-Linda says that "her Phineas and Ferb" are thirty (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said not to take too literally). However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue">Distant Epilogue</a> episode "Act Your Age" is supposed to be set ten years in the future, and the two are just now heading for college.
</li><li> In "Cranius Maximus", Isabella says she was "so looking forward to junior high", making her no more than twelve.
</li><li> Averted with Candace, who was 14 at the start of the show but turned 15 in "Candace Loses Her Head". In "Comet Kermillian", she says she will bust the boys when she's 88 (<strong>Ferb:</strong> Actually, you'll be 88 and a half."), and the comet can be seen every 73-and-a-half years, placing her age at 15 at the time of the episode (88-73=15).
</li><li> Jeremy also averts this, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> Candace mentions he's one year older than she is, placing him at 16.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> characters don't have their ages revealed, though "Goonland" and "Popeye, the Ace of Space" imply that Popeye himself is around 40, while "The Man on the Flying Trapeze" has Olive being called "a maid in her teens". Also in "Puttin' on the Act" (from 1940), it's shown that Popeye and Olive had an 1890s vaudeville act.
</li><li> The age of the titular trio in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">The Powerpuff Girls (2016)</a></em> is this. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">original show</a> Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup were explicitly five years old biologically (but younger due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Humans</a>), however the reboot is more ambiguous. They are in an elementary school and their class teaches elementary level subjects however their kindergarten teacher Ms. Keane is still their teacher. Their classmates look older than six, many of the students outright look like middle schoolers, and in one episode the girls were teased by classmates for "looking like babies". They sound older and act older but still use the same designs they did when they were five. According to one episode the girls have had five Picture Days, which pins them around ten or eleven years old. However, their classmate Princess is explicitly six. It's made even more confusing when a fourth Powerpuff Girl named Bliss appears who is explicitly a teenager and looks taller and curvier than the others.
</li><li> The three main ducks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuackPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuackPack">Quack Pack</a>. They are portrayed as teenagers, but their actual age is never revealed. However, they mentioned in one episode if they&#146;re old enough to drive a car, which would make them at or around 16.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRaccoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRaccoons">The Raccoons</a></em>, Bert acts like a child, but he also seemed to have graduated school and works as both a professional journalist and paperboy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RainbowBrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RainbowBrite">Rainbow Brite</a></em>: Rainbow barely reaches ten year old Brian's hips but is old enough to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with him. She and the other Color Kids act awfully mature for their looks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorLivingAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorLivingAlone">live alone</a>. There are implications that Rainbow has lived in Rainbow Land for years which brings to question <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">if she even ages</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em>: While it is known that Mindy is 4 years old, it is unknown how old the other kids are. It is likely they are in their mid-to-late preteens, but it is unclear. Sean knows what payload is, but somehow does not know what asteroids are. Meanwhile, due to the inconsistency with the animation, Mitchell is either taller or the same size as Mindy, and does not know how to spell "electric engine" yet can make a replica of Saturn V and somehow managed to acquire an ion drive.
</li><li> While most of the characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> are given ages, what age Cornchip Girl is and what grade she's in was left ambiguous. In "One Stayed Clean" she's shown among the kindergarteners, though this may have been accidental as she was shown running away from them earlier. Most episodes suggest she's in between grades first and third, but has been confirmed not to be in the same grade as the main six. Most fans tend to place her around seven.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The gang are old enough to travel on the road on a consistent basis but still young enough to be considered "Meddling Kids". This would suggest that they are young twenty-somethings, but some episodes of the original series seem to treat them as high schoolers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has Velma (the youngest) at <a class="urllink" href="http://www.velmadinkley.com/game.html">fifteen in the original series and the oldest two at seventeen<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Most direct-to-video movies and series since the late 1990s do put the gang <em>somewhere</em> in their twenties as one would expect. In one of the commercial bumpers for Cartoon Network around that same time, Fred even expresses his hatred of being called a "Meddling Kid", flat out stating he's 22 (yet, in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo">What's New, Scooby-Doo?</a></em>, they're referred to as "adolescents"). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> is one of the few exceptions, where they are all explicitly still in high school, and while Shaggy's and Velma's exact ages are not specified, Daphne and Fred are both stated to be seniors. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</a></em>, if you do the math, Velma's about eight or nine, Daphne's about nine or ten, and the boys are about ten or eleven (because dogs are considered puppies until about eighteen months), yet Velma's <em>Pup</em> design is seen in a flashback to her fifth birthday in <em>What's New</em> and in a flashback in a <em>Pup</em> episode, the gang are shown solving their first case and they're all in diapers, making Velma zero, Daphne one, and the boys two, yet they have a dog with them&mdash; either Scooby is a lot older than we think, or their first case was with a completely different dog. In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeCoolScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeCoolScoobyDoo">Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!</a></em>, Velma is applying to college, which would imply she's 17-18.
</li><li> Scrappy is also an enigma. He's smaller than Scooby and his catchphrase is "Puppy power!", but in the live-action movie, Daphne states that he isn't a puppy but has a gland problem.
</li></ul></li><li> <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. They are implied to be teenagers, but apparently attend Springfield Elementary. Kearney has a very screechy voice and acts like a teenage bully, but a few seasons in was frequently shown as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeldBackInSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeldBackInSchool">being in his thirties</a>. Yet even after that start, he would for instance need <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorWithFakeID" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorWithFakeID">a fake ID</a> or someone else to buy him beer. One episode shows that Jimbo is <em>bald</em> under his knit cap.
</li><li> And then there's Mr Burns...usually treated as being just on the high side of 100 years old, but one throwaway gag had him mentioning his birthplace: <strong>Pangaea</strong>. In the early years (1989-1993), when the show was more realistic, he gave his age as 81, suggesting he was born in the decade just prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. Also of note is that his Social Security number is <em>2</em> (only behind FDR).
</li><li> Homer's father, Abraham "Grandpa" Simpson is a pretty strong example. He was old enough to serve in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">the second World War</a> and is apparently around Mr. Burns' age, give or take a few years younger, as both men had served together. Also, it's been lampshaded in a few episodes that not even members of his own family are aware of how old he truly is. In "The Mansion Family", during a moment in a local awards show that was trying to determine who the oldest resident of Springfield was, he reports his age as less than 90, greater than 80, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScatterBrainedSenior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScatterBrainedSenior">and less than 70</a>. His character design is no help either, as in the episode with Homer's mother, she states that he's aged badly, which he blames on having to raise Homer by himself.
</li><li> Then there's Ned Flanders. In "Hurricane Neddy", he's seen as a kid thirty years ago but this kid is also quite ambiguous in age (his voice sounds quite high, but the adult Ned has quite a high voice for a dude anyway). This could make him probably in his thirties or maybe forties. However, in "Viva Ned Flanders", he claims he is actually sixty but is so healthy (and possibly is blessed by God from going to church so often if the "daily dose of vitamin church" line is to be believed) that he looks younger. It's possible that he was lying to get the seniors' discount, but that would be <em>very</em> out-of-character for Ned. There's also the fact that until the episode "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly", he had a wife named Maude who was either fertile or had only recently gone through menopause as their sons Rod and Todd are still children.
</li><li> Some of the students in Springfield Elementary will shift between being classmates with Bart (4th grade) and Lisa (2nd grade) depending on the needs of the plot.
</li><li> Then we have Rod and Todd. Both were around when Lisa was born, making them no younger than eight, and Rod looks a bit older (and in Lisa's story where she bases two alien brothers off the Flanders brothers, she says that one is two "space years" older than the other). This probably makes them either eight and ten, nine and eleven, or ten and twelve (Rod's voice hasn't changed, so he's probably not a teenager).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>: The ages of SpongeBob and Patrick are inconsistent.

Though this is probably not official confirmation</span>. They're both old enough to live on their own, drive, and hold down jobs, and some early episodes mention them having attended high school and community college in the past. The movie explicitly states that SpongeBob has won 374 Employee of the Month awards, meaning he's been working at The Krusty Krab for a little over 31 years by that point, even though most of the characters say he's "just a kid." Though if he ages like a real sponge, he's essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>.

<ul><li> Steven and Connie's ages were debated for a long time among fans, and were generally thought to be somewhere between 8 and 12. They're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintSizedKid">very short</a> and Steven is also quite immature. More than a year passed in-universe, without either visibly aging, before the late season two episode "Steven's Birthday" had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanHeLooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanHeLooks">Steven turn fourteen</a>, though he stopped growing around age eight because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> genes. Connie, who's a few months away from turning thirteen, is rather stunned by this news, having assumed Steven was younger than her.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Greg</strong>: Whoa, looks like you stagnated there a little bit, buddy.
</div></li><li> Sadie and Lars have been working at Big Donut for two years by the series' beginning, and in America most chain stores will only hire people older than sixteen. They don't seem to have any adult supervision at their job either. "Sadie's Song" states that she never went to prom, so she's presumably out of high school at the least. Lars has mentioned he's a teenager, and is apparently still in high school, meaning that he's probably either eighteen or nineteen. Their peers' ages are similarly broad, though the show's timeline implies Sour Cream specifically was about fifteen at the show's start.
</li><li> Gems technically have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">no physical ages</a>, however most look like adults. Ruby and Sapphire are both the same height as Steven, Ruby is hot-headed and unstable like a child, and unlike Amethyst they have childish bodies. Fans are torn whether they're supposed to look like little kids or are short, small chested women. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It doesn't help that their fusion, Garnet, is clearly an adult.</span>
</li><li> Amethyst's age is the least vague of all the Gem characters, but is still within the wide range of "less than 5000 years old", as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Kindergarten Amethyst was born in was shut down 6000 years ago and she wasn't present at a certain battle that took place 5000 years ago.</span>
</li><li> Peridot is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">The Napoleon</a>, has an immature personality, and like Amethyst the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a> was before her time. She could be almost any age younger than five millenia, though Lapis once insisted she was still much older than any human.
</li></ul></li><li> It's hard to pin an age onto the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake">Strawberry Shortcake</a></em> characters. They look like preteens both in their 2003 and 2007 designs, despite the fact Apple Dumplin' aged noticeably at least six years. It's made even more confusing by the fact the later episodes involve the characters getting jobs, moving out, and driving cars but no one looks over fourteen. The 2009 is equally bad, with the characters owning their own stores but looking no older than fifteen. Even prior to this, they lived in their homes, planned their own sleepovers, and otherwise generally managed their own lives and there were no parent characters shown. In "Baby Takes the Cake" from the 2003 series, Strawberry Shortcake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">warns viewers</a> to leave certain dangerous things related to cooking like using knives or handling a hot stove to an adult.

However, the description says they are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge">ten</a></em>, which is rather odd.

Raven has a plot-relevant birthday that fits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousSixteenthBirthday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousSixteenthBirthday">Dangerous 16th Birthday</a> trope, but no one actually ever mentions her age. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> has Cyborg more explicitly as 18-21, but it's unknown if that applies to the 2003 cartoon. <em>Go!</em> would also joke that Starfire is 156 in Tamaranian years, without saying how that translates to human years.
</li><li> Beast Boy in the <em>New Teen Titans</em> comics was sixteen during the arcs adapted. His age in the animated adaptation is harder to pin down. He's the shortest of the group, has a higher pitched voice than the other boys, and is treated as the youngest member. He's a <em>Teen</em> Titan so he can't be any younger than thirteen. In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">Bizarro Episode</a>, he gets a part-time job, which implies that he's at least sixteen. To make it more confusing, he split from the Doom Patrol years ago but doesn't seem much older than he did in flashbacks.
</li><li> Mas y Menos look and sound even younger than Beast Boy yet they are Teen Titans, pinning them at thirteen at the youngest.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThreeTwoOnePenguins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThreeTwoOnePenguins">3-2-1 Penguins!</a></em>, it's never explicitly stated or even implied how old the penguins are. Since they're penguins, their ages can't be determined by their appearances alone. If their ages are determined by their voices and how long it's been since Bert Bertman graduated from the Federation Academy, their ages would be from late twenties to early thirties.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> are young enough to be the offspring of the original Looney Tunes, to whom they are otherwise not related. Acme Looniversity has a prom as well as spring and summer breaks, and the Tiny Toons appear to be quite independent, but most of them still live with parents and are expected to obey their rules. These facts would normally suggest that they are high schoolers, but the majority of the cast do not seem like actual 9th to 12th graders at times. Montana Max and Elmyra Duff both look and behave more like elementary schoolers, while only Fifi La Fume and Arnold the Pitbull resemble teenagers in appearance and temperament. Further confusing matters is the theme song's reference to getting a "degree" as well as the fact that "Looniversity" is a pun on "university". In the first episode, Babs says she's 14, which would make sense for most of the characters, though Elmyra definitely looks and acts younger.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToddWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToddWorld">ToddWorld</a></em>, the main characters all seem to largely conduct their own affairs, roaming freely throughout ToddWorld, handling their own baths and scheduling activities and stuff. Yet they're also very childlike, often engage in pastimes generally enjoyed by children, and in "Snack Happy," Stella mentions having a special tuna sandwich that her mom made her. While there are adults on the show, the only parent that's ever seen is Sophie's cat, who is an adoptive mother of puppies.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TootAndPuddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TootAndPuddle">Toot &amp; Puddle</a></em>, Toot and Puddle live together on their own and do stuff like travel the world. Yet they seem to have a childlike quality about them and sometimes don't seem to know stuff that an adult should already know. For example, in "The Legend of Pocket Hollow," when Otto tells Puddle that a story of his is "just a legend," Puddle asks what a "legend" is. There's also the fact that neither of them stand much taller than cousin Opal, who is a clearly a young little girl, and in <em>I'll Be Home for Christmas</em>, Toot's aunt and uncle are both quite a bit wider and taller than him.
</li><li> The four cadets of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopWing">Top Wing</a></em> act like they could be 6-8 years old.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> has a downplayed case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen">Blaineley</a>. She is certainly elder to the original twenty-four contestants (who are around 17 in the third season), but it is not clear how large the age difference really is. She has a hosting job with both one adult and two teenagers, ends up briefly competing for the money alongside more teenagers, gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with both adult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Chef Hatchet</a> and teenaged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">Owen</a>, and admits to having crushes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">Justin as well as Alejandro</a>, who are both teenagers.
</li><li> Spike in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> - when he first appeared, he was working on an oil rig, but in a later episode, he mentioned he was too young for a driver's license. In the same episode, he <em>begins a romance with a girl who is in college.</em>
</li><li> It is difficult to tell if Piglet in the Disney versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> is supposed to be a child or an adult. His name and his short stature should imply that he is young, but his relatively mature personality suggests that he may be significantly older than Roo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>, Faragonda, Griffin, and Saladin are all depicted as mature adults on the side of elderly. However, flashbacks that show them acting as the Company of Light and Griffin as working with Valtor depict their younger selves in the same way the main cast (in their teens/twenties) are drawn&#151;except those flashbacks are from when Valtor was last active only eighteen years ago. If they were in their twenties then, they should be in their forties now, not their sixties-seventies.
<ul><li> Helia further complicates this point&#151;Saladin is drawn as being young man eighteen years ago, but he has a grandson who is at least nineteen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wonkidos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wonkidos">Wonkidos</a></em> has Evan the boy. He looks like he could be anywhere from two to <em>eleven</em> and he's still learning to do things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletTrainingPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletTrainingPlot">use the toilet</a>. The cartoon was meant for autistic children... but autism is so varied that its effects can vary from severe developmental problems to none at all and it's never revealed whether Evan himself is autistic or not. If he is, he'd likely be on the "high-functioning" end of the spectrum as he is fully verbal, doesn't stim or do anything like that, and becomes a pro at the lesson of the day as soon as it's explained to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinChronicles">Xiaolin Chronicles</a></em>, none of the Xiaolin Dragons have their ages stated, neither in the show nor in outside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">sources</a>. Kimiko and Omi celebrated their birthdays in the second series (although Omi techniqually chose the day he wants to celebrate it since he doesn't know when his birthday actually is), but no mention of their age whatsoever. The only known thing is that Ping Pong is the youngest, followed most likely by Omi. Likewize, there's no mention about Jack Spicer's age, either, and it's not made clear if he's a teenager or a young adult.

<ul><li> Charo. She was born January 15 of either 1941 (what her birth certificate says), 1945 (what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> says) or 1951 (what she says).
</li><li> Similarly, Ric Ocasek of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars">The Cars</a> was famously cagey about his age. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> and several other sources long stated his birthday as March 23, 1949, but some Cars fan sources claimed he was actually older than he himself said. This was confirmed upon his death from heart failure in September 2019, when his age was given as 75, putting his real birth year at 1944.
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueStahli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueStahli">BlueStahli</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Celldweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Celldweller">Celldweller</a>. Due to the fact that they never mention their age nor are their ages listed on any website.
<ul><li> Klayton is, however, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Klayton/163527">rumored<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">50, of all ages</a>, but he has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/celldweller/posts/10151024436601672">denied<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> said fact, but whether or not he's being honest is up to debate.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyWiseau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyWiseau">Tommy Wiseau</a> is famously secretive about his age. In 2010, he claimed to be 41, but other sources list his birth year as 1955, which would make him 55 as of that year. Proceedings in a 2016 lawsuit over a documentary on his life would confirm the 1955 date.
</li><li> The author Sydney, Lady Morgan was very vague about her age, maintaining that she was born in 1785 when it was probably 1781. Her death certificate (in 1859) gives her age as "about 80".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IdiAmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IdiAmin">Idi Amin</a>'s birth date is unknown, guessed at maybe 1923, 1925 or 1928.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a> stopped counting her age numerically at 17, and states that she doesn't have a birthday, she was "just dropped here".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanCrawford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanCrawford">Joan Crawford</a>'s exact date of birth is unknown, except that it was sometime in the 1900s (1904 at the earliest, 1908 at the latest).
</li><li> Boxing great Sonny Liston is another example. He was born to a poor sharecropping family in Arkansas either just before or during the Great Depression, and his birth was not officially recorded.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7g3i4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7g3i4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7g3i4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(The state didn't make birth certificates mandatory until 1965.)</span> Statements by him, his mother, and other family members were often contradictory, supporting dates anywhere from 1927 to 1933. He eventually settled on a 1932 birth date for official purposes, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">an aged appearance</a> lent credence to rumors of the earliest dates. The mystery of Liston's birth date will almost certainly go unsolved, but it's now most likely he was born sometime in the summer of 1930.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27wkd');"><sup>Evidence&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note27wkd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27wkd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When that year's U.S. Census was publicly released in 2002, Sonny (birth name Charles) wasn't listed. Ten years later, the 1940 Census was released, which listed Charles as a 10-year-old. Lending further support to a 1930 birth date is the census recording of Sonny's next-older brother Curtis. When the Liston family was recorded in the 1930 Census that April, Curtis was listed as between 6 and 12 months old. In April 1940, when census takers visited the Liston farm again, Curtis was listed as 11, although most likely still 10&#151;their mother may well have counted her children's years from birth inclusively.</span>
