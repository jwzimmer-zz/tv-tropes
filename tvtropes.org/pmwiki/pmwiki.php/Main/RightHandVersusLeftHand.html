</p><p>In any sort of story, good communication will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">often be counterproductive to comedy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap">drama</a>. But even in a dramatic sense, there are moments when the lack of communication is why two people are enemies, simply because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">they don't know what side the other is on.</a> In a large organization, the intended goals are not always entirely clear to everyone. Sometimes the project is so secret that the two groups don't know the other is working on it. These will often lead two parts of the same group doing counter-productive things, not knowing what the other is working towards.

If you want to introduce likable but misguided antagonists to tangle with the heroes and villains, this is a good way to keep them fighting everyone and stay relatable. Usually, if it's one side that insists on not comparing notes, it's because they're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualLoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualLoner">Ineffectual Loner</a> who will sooner or later get creamed by the bad guys.

Both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinji/Kaworu</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asuka/Mari</span> were actually trying to save the world. But the first faction was given wrong intel, believing that grabbing two certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyHolySword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyHolySword">artifacts</a> would return the post-apocalyptic Wasteland they live in to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">a habitable state</a>, when all it will actually do is to devastate the earth for good. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Shinji</a></span>, greatly agonizing about having to fight a former comrade, even tried to talk and explain, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asuka</span>, probably believing that he was willingly working for the villains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not an unreasonable guess given earlier events</span>, just charges him with a glaive to try and stop him and arrest him, putting him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">hopeless situation</a> where he'd disregard the vague warnings of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaworu</span> (who'd noticed something was off), and pull the doomsday devices.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">The original series</a> was no better: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Instrumentality project</a> required a single goal: that all Angels had to be destroyed first. But NERV and SEELE wanted to be the ones in control of Instrumentality by themselves, to the point that they were constantly trying to figure out how to have an edge over the other group without showing their own hand too early (to the point SEELE pretty much tried to counter one of Gendo Ikari's measures (Rei) by <em>allying themselves with one of the Angels</em> (Kaworu/Tabris)). And stuck in the middle was the JSSDF (and Kaji pulling double-agent duty), just trying to figure what the hell was going on and doing its duty to try to stop the Angels while distrusting the other groups (that used it as a source for cannon fodder).

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a></em> Kino encounters a railroad worker who spent the last twenty years of his life cleaning and maintaining a seemingly unused stretch of railroad. When she travels along the same railroad she encounters another railroad worker who spent the last twenty years of his life disassembling the same railroad. And finally she meets a railroad worker who spent the last twenty years of his life <em>reassembling</em> the same railroad. Ultimately Kino chooses to tell none of them that they wasted the last two decades of their lives.
</li><li> Jessie, James and Meowth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> often become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> for some Team Rocket plots when they're hatching a scheme of their own, especially if their rivals Butch and Cassidy are at the helms. It probably has to do with how, for a good portion of the anime, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleTrio">Terrible Trio</a> have been officially booted out of the organization (a fact that only those three don't seem to be aware of). It doesn't help some other Team Rocket members loathe the trio for these incompetent moments and sometimes intentionally target them in their schemes, giving the latter a reason to perform an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with Ash to get revenge.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> spin-off manga <em>G-Unit</em> has a feud between OZ and its black ops division OZ Prize, the main conflict coming from the fact that Prize answers directly to the Romefeller Foundation, the military-industrial combine that created OZ in the first place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Things only get worse when, after months of Prize failing to deliver, Romefeller hands control of the organization over to Valder Farkill, a talented and extremely ruthless OZ commander, and he starts purging the old guard.</span> The observers on colony MO-V (the object both factions are fighting over) even directly mention this trope when it first happens.

The army, which is run by if not completely composed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk">War Hawks</a>, is very eager to restart the war with the Arcanics, and is thus aligned with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Cumea</a>, who are pushing for that as well. By contrast, the navy's leadership is more reasonable and realistic about the cost of a war and are thus allied with the Prime Minister, who wants to maintain the peace as long as possible.

</li><li> The Dawn and Dusk Courts are technically on the same side against the Federation, but each has its own agenda. This is best exemplified in the relationship between the Warlord and the Baroness after they get married to unite their respective military assets &#151; aside from them not sharing information and running independent searches for Maika for their own reasons, during the siege of Ravenna the latter takes command of the former's air fleet to go after a separate target without letting her know in advance.

<ul><li> In nearly every modern monster movie it would be easy to defeat the monster if the human characters would stop bickering and cooperate. This is usually because if the special effects budget is too small to feature the monster a lot, having characters argue is an alternate way to introduce combat and suspense. Handled well this can be an effective way to introduce human drama and suspense. Handled badly it generates frustration among the viewers as it can involve handing characters the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and making the monster seem non-threatening (or make the audience look forward to the monster killing the humans).

Snipe, an ex-radiologist is less concerned about saving lives, but "winning" the game, and is just as likely to put lives in danger as he is to save them. As Ex-Aid is the hero, this leads to Brave being the closest to his own motivation, but he can be callous towards the victim, Lazer being the easiest Rider to befriend, but the least trustworthy, and Snipe being the most knowledgeable about the Rider systems, but the most antagonistic of the four.

</li><li> This is the central theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>. Time and again, organizations and people within those organizations fails to work together for the greater good of the whole due to personal ambition, poor communication, outright malice and simple incompetence. This is symbolized early on when several police officers fail to get a desk through a doorway until they realize that both sides are trying to push the desk into the opposite room.
</li><li> In season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> the FBI, ATF and Justice Department are all working together to bring down the Sons who have allied themselves with a dangerous Mexican drug cartel.

One of the Major's two flunkies eventually reveals to the other that he's an undercover FBI agent and offers him immunity if he cooperates...to which he replies he doesn't have to since he's he's <em>also</em> an undercover agent from the Office of Budget and Management. The FBI agent then says "Boy...talk about the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing" and the other replies "We don't even know what our own <em>feet</em> are doing!".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt">The Thick of It</a></em> features endless disasters that could have been avoided if the various participants were willing to coordinate properly, (though admittedly things progress/degenerate so <em>fast</em> in their world that they often simply don't have time for anything but off-the-cuff responses,) but Season 4 has more than the previous ones because half of its time is spent with the coalition government. This latter case is made even worse than usual cases of this trope by the fact that the two ministers hate each other, follow violently opposing party principles, are constantly trying to score political points for their own party (usually at the expense of the other,) and the person who is meant to be liaising between them is a particularly unhelpful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> was mostly based around the conflict between transitory politicians, who want to make a lot of change very quickly, and permanent civil servants, who want to maintain status quo at all costs. However, occasionally it would be shown that the government and Civil Service had constant internal conflicts, with Ministers constantly jockeying for position, and senior civil servants trying to accumulate influence and money for their departments.

The CIA doesn't like the NSA, and both of them look down on the FBI. And then of course there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">DEA</a>. The very first episode starts with Sarah (CIA) trying to keep Chuck out of Casey's (NSA) hands even though <em>both</em> were ordered by their superiors to locate the stolen Intersect, and the <em>next</em> episode involves Casey convincing Chuck that Sarah may be rogue. The team frequently butts heads with foreign intelligence agencies (MI6, the French Secret Service, etc.) precisely because no one has bothered to tell the team (or Beckman and Graham) that other agencies are even involved (and in at least one case the team was ordered to interfere <em>regardless</em> to get the credit first). And let's not even start on all the ways operations have been fouled up because one or more team members went off on a rogue mission.

<ul><li> A lot of the drama that culminated in Nelson &amp; Murdock breaking up at the end of season 2 would've been avoided if Matt had just told Karen and Foggy right away about Elektra being back in town rather than keep her a secret from them. If he had, Foggy and Karen likely could've talked him out of several date night fights with ninjas and made Frank Castle's trial less of a disaster. By not telling them, Foggy ends up being blindsided when Elektra sabotages their key witness in Frank's trial, and Karen is led to think Matt is cheating on her when she finds a wounded Elektra recovering in his bed.

Likewise, the Stokes' are as much involved in constant internal conflicts as well as conflicts with other crime lords, and that's before their conflicts with Luke or the NYPD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMandalorian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMandalorian">The Mandalorian</a></em>: The protagonist gets a contract from a mysterious Client, requesting that he capture a target (preferably alive, but they'll accept dead) and bring it back. Not long into the hunt, the Mandalorian starts running into other bounty hunters from his guild who are after the same target; the Client didn't want to take any chances, so he gave every hunter in the guild the same contract, figuring <em>one</em> of them would be good enough to get it. Further complicating matters, many of the other hunters are content to simply kill the target and be done with it, something that our hero understandably objects to given that said target is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <em>baby</em>.</span>
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSVU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSVU">Law &amp; Order: SVU</a></em> had the team perform a sting on a pedophile operation, only to have one of the members reveal he was undercover with another agency, meaning the SVU just messed up his case.

<ul><li> Take any two major subfactions of the Imperium of Man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. The Space Marines, the Inquisition, the Adeptus Mechanicus... any two. Chances are they're each working to undo something one of the others has done or is going to do. The Inquisition actually has Right Hand Versus Left Hand as <em>departmental policy</em>, and so much factional infighting occurs within that organization that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Inquisitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Inquisitor">they made an entire game about it</a>. This is partly a pragmatic out-of-universe decision - you need to provide the opportunity for <strong>any</strong> two armies to be able to fight each other.
<ul><li> There is an example in the game's fiction of an incident early in the history of the Imperium, before Imperial Guard equipment and uniforms were regulated (well, closer to regulation) in which two armies of Guardsmen from different worlds encountered one another, each deciding that the other must be a hostile force. Several thousand were killed before the commanders on either side realised what was going on.
<ul><li> The Shira Calpurnia novels demonstrate this to almost depressing levels. The first novel alone demonstrates the minutia of political (and literal) conflict and vested interests between the Adeptus Arbites, Ministorum, Ecclesiarchy, Navy, Navigators, Astropaths, Sorroritas, and the Inquisition, all of whom are meant to work together. And this is just in one hive of one planet in one of innumerable sectors in the Imperium.
</li><li> There is actually a good reason why this is the case in the Imperium, during the Horus Heresy, Horus was able to turn roughly half the military (including ships, Space Marines, Mechanicus and Guard regiments) to his side without anyone noticing. This, and other incidents such as the Age of Apostasy, means that all Imperial organisations are encouraged to distrust and compete against each other, to make sure no one man can ever accumulate enough personal power to threaten the Imperium...but it also means that nothing short of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> suddenly recovering from his corpse state on the Golden Throne will ever allow the Imperium to get out of the shit barrel of problems it's created for itself in the past 10,000 years.
</li></ul></li><li> The Inquisition gets another special mention, because they're just a gold mine of this trope. The Ordo Originatus wishes to investigate and uncover secrets that have been lost to time regarding the founding of the Inquisition itself, believing it will make the Inquisition as a whole more powerful and help cement humanity's victory. The Ordo Redactus seeks to obfuscate and destroy that very same information, fearing it'll fall into the hands of mankind's most dangerous foes.
</li><li> In fact, this is standard operating procedure for <em>nearly everyone</em> in 40k, to the point that one could argue the only reason <em>any</em> of races in the setting have survived for as long as they have is because <em>everyone else</em> is too busy with internal fighting to commit everything they have to warfare. The Eldar craftworlds distrust one another, the Chaos subfactions are, as the name implies, rather chaotic and opposed to each other, the Dark Eldar will rape and kill anything that moves, the two active Necron star-gods are distinctly opposed to each other, and Tyranid forces from different splinter fleets will attack and consume one another on sight to test out each others' biological enhancements. Orks are always up for a fight, and the nearest other thing that looks like a good fight is usually the Ork right next to him, so they end up constantly fighting eachother unless a powerful Warboss unites them on a <strong>WAAAAAAAAGH!</strong>. The only faction that seems somewhat united are the Tau, who are about the smallest faction to boot, and they've got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Commander Farsight</a> off doing his thing.
<ul><li> With the Tyranid example, the winning side will then consume all of the bio-mass out there (from both sides), convert it into new warriors, and end up with a force of the same size of the two individual fleets combined but with only the more capable designs. This is an overall 'bad thing' for everyone else in the galaxy.
</li><li> Often, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">not</a>. This is because dealing with one enemy is much easier than dealing with two. For example, the Imperium regularly wipes out smaller Hive Fleets using genetically engineered viruses. Each Hive Fleet requires a different virus. Therefore one Hive Fleet is easier to deal with than two. And of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">all too often, the new designs are only better for fighting other Tyranids</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Tzeentch, Chaos god of change, magic, backstabbing and hope, thrives on this. His every plan is designed to cause and/or require another to fail, even those that would ensure his complete victory over all other gods... because that would leave him no one to plot <em>against</em>.

<ul><li> This is sometimes given as the reason for Nazi Germany not using/developing further the technology that it invented.
<ul><li> Generally, in Nazi Germany, it wasn't normally the case of not knowing what the others were doing, but more of each department (or leader) wanting to develop it independently and not share any credit with anyone else.
</li><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> didn't show a great deal of interest in the day-to-day running of his government, his top ministers engaged in what they called "Working Towards the Fuehrer", where they would try to formulate policy based on his vague directives and ranting speeches. This worked out about as well as you can imagine. On the other hand, when Hitler did get personally involved he often made things even worse.
</li><li> It also really didn't help that a good portion of the German scientists that were experts in the field were of the "Undesirables" and had either fled the country, or ended up dead.
</li><li> As a contrast, apparently the Army wanted the Manhattan Project tightly compartmentalized, but Robert Oppenheimer insisted that science didn't work well that way.
<ul><li> The Manhattan Project WAS highly compartmentalized, it's just that it got so big (larger than most European Government ministries and some European Governments) that the compartments by necessity had to be pretty big too.
</li></ul></li><li> Also on the theme of Nazi Germany, there were <em>several</em> intelligence agencies - each run by a different high-ranking Nazi Party official - in <em>direct competition</em> receiving the <em>same information</em>. Hitler's eugenic policies as applied to the German intelligence community didn't end well, suffice to say.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Abwehr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Abwehr">Abwehr</a> was run by one Admiral Canaris, a Navy man and not a Nazi official. As it happens he was actually on good terms with Reinhard Heydrich, head of the SD (the intelligence arm of the SS). Though that friendship turned sour as Canaris was actually a leading figure in the Resistance, whilst Heydrich was quite loyal to the Nazi ideology, and as they started to really appreciate each other's natures each man moved to bring the other down. The Abwehr differs from the other Nazi examples in that it sought to actively undermine the Nazi effort, and probably played a role in Heydrich's assassination, but was not averse to co-operating with other agencies. It just so happens that these agencies were usually British.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NazisWithGnarlyWeapons">Nazi army</a> was split up by Hitler in rather insane ways to make sure each part was too weak to overthrow him. Instead of the normal "army, navy, and air-force," set up, each group had varying sizes of battalions from all three, which at times caused confusion over who had command over which troops.
</li><li> <em>Nine different organisations</em>, among them the <strong>German Post Office</strong>, had a nuclear program.
</li></ul></li><li> 9/11 might have been prevented if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FBI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FBI">FBI</a> and other agencies communicated with each other about the hijackers. But they distrusted and disliked each other.
<ul><li> As a rule, pretty much all American federal organizations seem to suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JurisdictionFriction">a massive inter-agency distrust</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">rivalry</a>. Then there's the whole inter-branch issues between the different branches of the military.
</li><li> Also usually issues of strict rules on who can do what. The CIA may figure out who the Russians have as a spy in a meeting in Vienna, but have to work with the FBI to do anything. The firewalls between them to prevent abuse of powers mean often the FBI wasn't told what they needed to know.
<ul><li> There were also legal issues involved. The FBI's primary mission is law enforcement; its job is to investigate crimes and obtain evidence with which to successfully convict criminals in a court of law. The CIA's primary mission is espionage; its job is to find out things that other nations or hostile groups wish to keep secret. One of these two agencies has to worry about whether or not evidence it gathers is legally admissible in a court of law, and one of them doesn't. This results in the CIA often knowing things that the FBI not only doesn't know, but <em>can't be told</em> &mdash; because by the "fruit of the poison tree" doctrine, one piece of illegally obtained evidence invalidates not only itself, but everything subsequently found in the investigation as a result of following up on the original, inadmissible, lead. The problem re: 9/11 lay in the fact that the laws did not take into account that the FBI's <em>counter-intelligence</em> division does <em>not</em> suffer from this mission limitation, as CI's primary mission is not to build a clean criminal case either. One of the purposes of the Patriot Act was to change the rules so that the FBI in its counter-intelligence role could be brought into espionage compartments that the FBI in its law enforcement role couldn't touch.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also the fact that both the CIA (Aldrich Ames) and FBI (Robert Hanssen) had been infiltrated by high-level Russian spies in the last decade. Hanssen was arrested in February 2001, and so the CIA would have been even more cautious about trading confidential information at the critical time.
<ul><li> During the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis">Iranian Hostage Crisis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the Army, Navy, and Air Force each wanted to take the lead on getting the hostages out of Iran, so that none of them could hog all the glory. So they came up with a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw">compromise plan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The result? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Catastrophic failure.</a> Afterward, the U.S. Special Operations Command (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">SOCOM</a>) was created out of the special operations branches of all three services. The Marine Corps followed suit... <em>eventually</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 3/11 train bombings in Madrid were also blamed on lack of coordination between the national police corps (civilian) and the civil guard (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">military-led</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Practically standard operating procedure for large IT corporations:
<ul><li> While Apple Computer provides dozens of instances of this, the classic example is the near-simultaneous barrage of the competing Apple ///, Lisa, Macintosh and IIGS platforms, all developed alongside each other by different feuding kingdoms within the company. At first Jobs tried to straighten it out, but ended up in one of the factions.
</li><li> Just in the described period it led to the Macintosh XL debacle, when Apple tried to sell the already underpowered and overpriced Lisa as an upmarket version of Macintosh and failed, and their killing of the IIGS simply because it was seen as cannibalizing the Mac's market share: they were similar enough in performance and usability, but the GS was sold at significantly lower profit margin. Apple /// plainly sucked though.
</li><li> Various parts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a>'s American and Japanese divisions all tried to launch an entire solar system of extraterrestrially codenamed products (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">CD, 32X,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Saturn</a>, etc.), plus numerous other, often incompatible, combinations thereof. It didn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">there was mistrust</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">lack of communication between Sega's Japanese and American branches</a>, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">general executive failure</a> (mostly from the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">Bernie Stolar</a>, who is often held as having singlehandedly killed the American Saturn by preventing anything that was worth playing on the system from reaching America). The resulting collision landed with a dull thud in the marketplace and was largely responsible for obliterating Sega as a hardware manufacturer (as they were in so much debt, they would've had to sell an unrealistic amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Dreamcasts</a> to become profitable again, which didn't happen thanks to the hype over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> meaning everyone forgot about the DC).
<ul><li> This was also part of the reason behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicXTreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicXTreme">Sonic X-treme</a></em> becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware">Vaporware</a>; the team behind the game was split in two and given different parts of the game to develop, with no communication between them. By time Sega of Japan representatives came to check up on progress, the two parts of the game had been taken in wildly different directions. It didn't help that they tried reusing the game engine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams">NiGHTS into Dreams...</a></em> and were denied its use after the fact.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> seems to be particularly prone to this, likely as a result of its confusing corporate structures (many different divisions in various activities- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures">movie making</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyInteractiveEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyInteractiveEntertainment">video gaming</a>, etc.- plus regional outposts) mucking things up. Sony has been described not only as a feudal kingdom, but as "four separate companies, without a word to say to each other". Examples include:
<ul><li> One of the most interesting cases of this was the background maneuvering in the Napster civil suit: Sony, manufacturer of computer products, saw Napster as a profitable way to get more people to use computers, and therefore funded much of their legal defense. However! Sony, entertainment and intellectual property owner, saw Napster as stealing their products through Digital Piracy, and therefore also funded most of the suit!
</li><li> Some Sony DVD players can have their region coding disabled, and user's manuals actually <em>tell</em> users how to do it. The electronic manufacturer division greatly profits from the sales of the DVD players, which are boosted by movies' availability, but the IP owner division loves to wring the last coin from the watchers, which is more easily done by such things as region-specific prices and release dates, hence the regional codes. The ability to disable the codes appears to be a some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">uneasy compromise</a>.
</li><li> In a tamer example, Sony Interactive Entertainment (the video games arm) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">a bitter rivalry</a> with Nintendo in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars">Console Wars</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> (AOL) TimeWarner suffered from this pretty much from the get go. The company was intended to be synergy-friendly by longtime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Communications</a> chairman Steve Ross. However, he died in 1992, and his successors, Gerald Levin and Jeff Bewkes (both of whom came from Time Inc. via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a>) inexplicably seemed to fear/loathe synergy and discouraged it, which in turn made the company's various divisions often run up against each other. In 1993, most of the company's entertainment assets (including WB, HBO and Cinemax) were put into a joint venture with telephone company US West called "Time Warner Entertainment". When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TedTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TedTurner">Turner Broadcasting</a> merged with TW in 1996 this meant that its' production and distribution assets were absorbed into WB<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rs97');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2rs97" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rs97');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> took a while to be fully integrated into WB Animation, with a separate sub-division, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> Studios, remaining under Turner's control. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewLineCinema" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewLineCinema">New Line Cinema</a> (which was also bought out by Turner), on the other hand wasn't integrated into WB until 2008, and remained autonomous by that point</span>, but the company remained as a semi-autonomous unit of Time Warner (the aforementioned TWE joint venture ended in 2003 after Comcast sold their stake, having inherited it through various mergers). The company tried and failed multiple times to take advantage of the emerging internet and leverage their properties in the process, as both the Pathfinder portal and the AOL merger backfired hugely (the latter moreso than the former). Even as the company slimmed down over the years, losing its' book and music publishing groups, AOL, its' cable systems and finally Time Inc. itself, the walls between the WB, HBO and Turner divisions remained rather strong. Ultimately, AT&amp;T's purchase of the company (and subsequent renaming to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMedia">WarnerMedia</a>) in 2018 finally averted the trope, as they acted to reorganize the company and increase synergy and interaction&mdash; Turner and HBO are no longer separate units, instead their assets have been reassigned into new divisions<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3mxcc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3mxcc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3mxcc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">CN, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TurnerClassicMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TurnerClassicMovies">Turner Classic Movies</a> now report to Warner Bros., while HBO is part of the WarnerMedia Entertainment division alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS">TBS</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT">TNT</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TruTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TruTV">Tru TV</a>, Otter Media (an AT&amp;T asset, home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Crunchyroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VRV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VRV">VRV</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">Rooster Teeth</a>; they were also division of Warner Bros. for two months) and the upcoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax">HBO Max</a> streaming service and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN">CNN</a>, along with Bleacher Report, Turner Sports and the AT&amp;T SportsNet <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RSNs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RSNs">RS Ns</a> are now the WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports division</span>.

<ul><li> One quote by Curtis LeMay, Air Force general: "The Soviets are our adversary, our enemy is the Navy." On the other side of the coin, the so-called Revolt of the Admirals, an unprecedented public protest by high-ranking Navy officers to the shifting of budget priority from aircraft carriers to the Air Force's nuclear arsenal, arguing that any future war would be just an exchange of nukes and therefore the Navy (and the Army) was unnecessary. Part of this was the Navy wanting nukes of their own (they got them, in the form of the ballistic missile submarine) but another was to maintain sufficient conventional force and flexibility of deployment to fight less-than-nuclear conflicts. Since the number of wars involving nuclear ballistic missiles is currently zero, this is somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>.
</li><li> The concept of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jointness">"Jointness"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is designed to try to reduce the branch rivalries. Its success is varied. At budget time, you can pretty much bet each service will receive the same amount of money, regardless of need. And the US Marines always get special treatment, as they really push the "we are Marines" more than anything.
</li><li> And some countries, like Canada, tried to solve the problem by simply amalgamating all three branches into one unified Force with an overarching command structure.
</li></ul></li><li> This one's often cited as one problem in the GM bankruptcy drama. Eight divisions, each with separate dealer networks, separate bureaucracies right up to very high-level management, all trying to push towards building the same cars for the same customers. Worse yet, they often build exactly the same car with a different name, selling them at separately-owned dealerships in a city too small for the coverage, and have the dealerships spend thousands per car competing with each other to sell the same car to the same person.
<ul><li> A similar thing happened when pretty much <em>every single British car company</em> (not owned by foreign concerns, such as Vauxhall being owned by the aforementioned GM; Rolls-Royce/Bentley and a few others were also unaffected) merged into British Leyland in the 1960s. None of the companies involved knew how to work with each other, and combine that with inept workers, bad build quality and design, constant labor strikes and horrible management, led to BL becoming a national joke in the 70s, resulting in the government stepping in to nationalize it. Eventually it broke apart completely in the early 80s and most of the brands it had have been consigned to history as a result. The only real survivors were Jaguar and Land Rover, who got snatched up by Ford for a while before being sold to Tata Motors of India.

</li><li> This is a very important issue to look out for in the computer science industry, as there are often many individuals/groups contributing to a single project but not actually working together and great pains must be taken to ensure all their code will work together smoothly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a> often deliberately encouraged this among key players in the Chinese Communist Party (withholding critical information, being deliberately ambiguous, or feeding them outright lies), so that none of them could gain enough traction to challenge his power or discredit him after his death. Even more cunningly, he often permitted his wife or his <em>really</em> trusted lieutenants to speak for him, so that he could maintain some semblance of plausible deniability.

This messed up foreign policy quite a bit; several times an allied prince could not tell what it was exactly that the British were doing because they had <em>two</em> foreign policies going on. This could lead to suspicions of treachery in cases where only red tape was to blame.

</li><li> A drastic surge of equally humorous stories emerged of companies/artists being taken down or issued warnings on their own properties, largely due to updates to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>'s EULA and copyright policies allowing said companies to more easily send out these notices, up to and including automated "bots" scanning through videos and channels and automatically sending out instant-takedown notices... without first checking if it was their own channels. This overreliance also led to instances where entertainers or video game producers were getting take-down notices for posting their <em>own, original</em> material, nevermind something like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong">Suspiciously Similar Song</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> that should be protected under Fair Use or public domain.

</li><li> It is generally a bad idea to be in competition with yourself, resources are needed to maintain an edge in an aggressive market. Those resources have a hard enough time fighting against genuine competitors and maintaining competition against yourself doubles those resources. The only way to make even is by dominating a given market. Say there are three restaurants on a given intersection, all other things being equal those restaurants will acquire 33 percent of that market. If the parent company of one business was to open another branch in the open spot on the intersection it would reduce the market share of the other businesses from 33 percent to 25 percent, including the one they already own. The big difference is that the parent company now controls 50 percent of that market when before they only controlled 33 percent with the one business there. It ends up doing well for the parent company but it hurts the sub-franchise.

After Aetius' own emperor personally assassinated him (the emperor had been persuaded by two of Aetius' rivals that the general had threatening dynastic ambitions,) a member of the court told the emperor "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServileSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServileSnarker">I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know that you have acted like a man who has cut off his right hand with his left.</a>" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was absolutely right; two of the conspirators (one of whom was the emperor himself!) were murdered by the third in revenge for them backing out of their side of the bargain.

</li><li> This is also a common problem in academia. Though all are theoretically devoted to the broader cause of advancing human knowledge, in practice there is a substantial amount of competition for funding and prestige between universities, and departments within individual universities. Even when relations between departments are friendly, the degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> in many academic fields, especially the natural sciences, means that scholars in one field may not have the information necessary to realize that they could benefit from the assistance of scholars in another. One of the most famous examples comes from <em>Laboratory Life,</em> in which two labs staffed by biologists and biochemists labored in vain for the better part of a decade to understand the structure of the hormone TRFH, then solved the problem in a matter of months when one finally thought to bring in an analytical chemist.
</li><li> Many examples from the various branches of the BBC.
<ul><li> In the early days of the internet, the BBC launched BBC Online as a third medium division alongside television and radio. It included content about BBC-produced entertainment. Meanwhile, BBC Worldwide launched Beeb.com. It focused on BBC-produced entertainment. There was some dispute over how to resolve the duplication.
</li><li> In the late 90s and early 2000s, it was generally assumed that even if anyone wanted to produce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> for television again, the television rights were too widely scattered to be feasible.
<ul><li> BBCi decided to produce a Doctor Who webcast for the 2003 40th anniversary, on the grounds that it didn't look like anybody else was ever going to make Doctor Who again. After much dodging of the question from legal, they managed to get hold of someone who could give them something resembling a straight answer: "The Terry Nation estate owns the Daleks, therefore you cannot do Doctor Who." After getting this person to comprehend the notion that they wanted to do a Doctor Who story without the Daleks, they got the straighter answer "Doctor Who itself is owned by the BBC and can be produced with no trouble at all, while certain races, villains, and characters are owned by their creators". BBCi went ahead with production.
</li><li> When the new BBCTV controller stated publicly that she would like to bring back Doctor Who, but the rights would likely be too thorny, fans hammered on BBCi's inbox with questions asking if they were sure they were okay legally. BBCi put up a page clearly explaining the status of the rights.
</li><li> BBCTV executives called in the head of BBCi demanding to know why he told the internet he thought he had the rights to make Doctor Who. He brought in all of his correspondence with legal that said it was alright. He left with the confidential information that the show was going to be returning to television. Suddenly the webcast BBCi was making because nobody else was ever going to do anything with Doctor Who on television again became a minor footnote next to the anniversary surprise that Doctor Who was returning to television in a few years' time.

<ul><li> In 1932, a bloke named Rosay got in a car crash with a military truck and got contradictory decision from both civilian and military courts on the case. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Since then</a>, the <em>Tribunal des Conflits</em> can make final rulings in these cases.

<ul><li> This conflict has become more common between the regular and administrative law courts. For instance, a person can be acquitted of a crime in a regular court, but if they're on parole may still be sent back to prison...<em>on the same charges</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> A crowning example would be during the Teapot Dome scandal, where Secretary of the Interior Fall was convicted of receiving a bribe from Ted Doheny... but in a separate trial, Doheny was acquitted of the charge of having allegedly bribed the Secretary of the Interior.
</li><li> In the United States, an occurrence of this almost always results in the Supreme Court hearing the case. At the Federal Court level, the different districts can reach some wildly different conclusions on the same case. The 9th Circuit Court (the largest and most likely to be overturned) hears all cases for most states west of the Rockies and some east or on the Rockies. However, their decisions are only applied in those states. The 12 Circuit Court (on the East Coast) can come up with some other decision and only applies to those states. The supreme court will hear the case to unify the whole situation.
</li><li> In the United States, this can get into some strange issues with jurisdictions that have the death penalty for capital crimes and those that do not and the crime occurs in both jurisdictions (The D.C. Beltway Sniper case of 2003, for example, had trials in both Maryland and Virginia). Typically, the death penalty case goes first while the non-death penalty case wrestles with the idea of even trying the guy if he does get convicted and sentenced to death because they can't do anything after that punishment is... ahem... executed.

</li><li> During the first year of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Trump</a> administration, relations between the White House and State Department gradually deteriorated, with Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson often making contradictory statements and seeming to follow separate foreign policies. Trump being Trump, he also openly feuded with Tillerson on Twitter, who was reported to have referred to the President as a "f***ing moron". This culminated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Trump firing Tillerson via tweet while the latter was on a diplomatic mission in Africa</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/detroit-police-officers-fight-each-other-in-undercover-op-gone-wrong">A group of undercover Detroit police officers, posing as drug dealers, tried to arrest another group of undercover officers, posing as drug buyers.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Over two dozen armed officers get into a brawl with each other as a result.
</li><li> Trains in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London">London</a> sometimes run from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalRail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalRail">National Rail</a> tracks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground">The London Underground</a> (but only the parts that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">aren't actually underground</a> because mainline trains can't fit through the tunnels). One such location is near Wimbledon. As employees of the two companies can't enter onto the other's trackage due to differing safety standards, they have to agree on where one company ends and the other begins, but at Wimbledon, they couldn't agree on that either, leaving a gap of track that wasn't inspected or maintained for a number of years. <a class="urllink" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/679597/D012018_180207_Wimbledon.pdf">You can guess what happened next.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> There's cases of how serial killers would be caught much quicker and they'd have less victims (i.e. Richard Ramirez, aka The Night Stalker) if local and state police as well as the FBI would just openly share information with each other rather than be more concerned with who received the recognition for their capture.
</li><li> This is how tissue rejection works. The foreign tissue is there to keep the patient alive, but the immune system attacks it, also in an effort to keep the patient alive. Everything's doing its job right, but they're working at cross-purposes and the patient is having their shiny new liver eaten by cytotoxic T-cells who think it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>.
</li><li> The British <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Airship_Scheme">Imperial Airship Scheme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> suffered from this. The idea was that having two competing designs for building airships would allow for more innovation. So Lord Thompson, Secretary of State for Air, had two ships built. One, the 'capitalist' <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R100">R100<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, was built by private company Vickers, while the 'socialist' <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R101">R101<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, was built by the British Air Ministry. The trouble was that neither Vickers nor the Air Ministry were willing to cooperate or share their innovations &#150; the fact that Thompson blatantly favoured the Air Ministry and the <em>R101</em> didn't help either. Despite the favouritism, the <em>R100</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">wasn't that groundbreaking, but did decently</a>, and even managed a transatlantic flight to Canada. For the <em>R101</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">design faults became apparent before it was even tested</a>, and while it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">was larger and had more innovative technology</a>, it was beyond obvious that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">held together through stopgap repairs and no small amount of luck</a>. To make matters worse, the Vickers team had a chance to inform the Air Ministry of these defects, but didn't want to do their rivals any favours. And not helping was that Lord Thompson and others in the Air Ministry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredExpert">repeatedly ignored warnings from their subordinates</a> lest they look like fools in front of Vickers, and insisted the <em>R101</em> undertake a demonstration voyage from Britain to India. This ill-advised flight resulted in the <em>R101</em> crashing in France in bad weather, killing 48 people (including Lord Thompson). The disaster discredited the entire Imperial Airship Scheme, the <em>R100</em> was scrapped, and British airship development ground to a screeching halt. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NevilShute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NevilShute">Nevil Shute</a>, who had worked for the <em>R100</em>'s design team, bitterly remarked that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveAvoidedThisPlot">the whole mess wouldn't have happened</a> had the Air Ministry swallowed their pride and taken cues from Vickers.
