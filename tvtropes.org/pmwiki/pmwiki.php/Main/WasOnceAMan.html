</li><li> Quite a lot of animals in Greek myth were actually humans who ticked off the gods and were transformed into beasts, Arachne (once a human, then a spider) and King Lykans (once a human, then a wolf) being the two most prominent.
</li><li> Scylla and Charybdis also fall into this category, as several myths hold them to be former nymphs who were transformed into hideous monsters.
</li><li> Oddly subverted in the case of Heracles though. Born a man, his heroism leads him to be elevated to a god. Admittedly, one of his parents was a god, but there are plenty of other heroes in Greek mythology who have one divine parent, and Heracles is the only one who manages to become a god himself (though there are several humans who upon their deaths are made into constellations, trees, islands, stars, etc. so that they will never 'die').

<ul><li> The Falmer were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter">Snow Elves</a> who, after losing a war against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>, sought refuge with the Dwemer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">a technologically-advanced race of underground elves</a>. As part of the contract the Falmer agreed to eat a fungus which caused the loss of their eyesight and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves">enslaved</a> by their kin. Not only did the Snow Elves physically degenerate into something resembling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks">Morlocks</a>, but what the Falmer went through fundamentally changed their <em>very souls</em>. The no longer possess the "black" souls of sapient species. Instead, they possess "white" souls like those of animals.
</li><li> The Dreugh, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishPeople">aquatic humanoid octopi</a>, were once far more intelligent. While sources conflict regarding the exact details, the Dreugh were said to have once ruled the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeOfMyths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeOfMyths">in a time long, long ago</a>. Like the Falmer, the Dreugh de-evolution from an intelligent, sapient race with their own civilization has included their souls becoming white, like those of animals.
</li><li> The series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires</a> can play this on two levels. All Vampires were once mortals who have been infected with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">disease</a> that caused their transformation into a blood-sucking creature of the night, or it was a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">gift</a>" received directly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Molag Bal</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Domination and Corruption</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor">created the first vampire</a>. On a different level, while most vampires maintain a sense of humanity, if they go too long without feeding, they are known to go irrevocably insane and feral. These feral Vampires are referred to as "Bloodfiends."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">Liches</a> are another such example. Once mortal wizards (often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancy">necromancers</a>), they have undergone a process that sacrifices their humanity and very <em>lives</em> to become powerful undead sorcerers. Some are able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">maintain a facade of humanity</a> using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">powerful illusion magic</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">switch to their undead forms for combat</a>.
</li><li> The Ideal Masters are immortal beings who were once powerful mortal sorcerers during the Merethic Era. After finding their mortal forms to be too weak and limiting, they entered Oblivion as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">beings of pure energy</a> and settled an area of "chaotic creatia", forming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">Soul Cairn</a>. The Ideal Masters are most infamous for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">trafficking in souls</a>, especially "Black" sapient souls. All souls trapped in soul gems end up in the Soul Cairn and are considered property of the Ideal Masters, who seem to possess a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a> for adding more. The Ideal Masters do not usually manifest physically within the Soul Cairn, but have been known to take the form of giant soul gems through which individuals can communicate with them, and through which they can drain the souls of approaching mortals.
</li><li> Malacath, the Daedric Prince of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheOtherReindeer">Spurned and Ostracized</a> and patron deity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a>, was once the Aedric spirit Trinimac, beloved by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter">Aldmer</a>. Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Plots</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackingCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackingCthulhu">"ate" Trinimac</a> in order to manipulate Trinimac's followers, who would become the Chimer. After being tortured in Boethiah's stomach, the remains of Trinimac were "excreted". These remains became Malacath and his remaining followers were transformed into the Orsimer (Orcs).

They performed a ritual in which they traded their humanity for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">access to powerful magic</a>.

As he ate, he became larger and more grotesque and eventually became a massive slug-like monster.
</li><li> Mytha herself also counts due to <em>her</em> unrequited love for her betrothed (implied to be the Old Iron King) who loved another. In her mad quest to attain more beauty, she became a naga-like poisonous monster with a disembodied head.
</li><li> The Old Iron King is <em>also</em> an example. When he got incinerated by the Smelter Demon and his kingdom sank into the lava, whatever was left of him encountered something deep beneath the surface and was reborn as a demonic looking lava monster known as Ichorous Earth.

<ul><li> When you first encounter Champion Gundyr, he's long since succumbed to the Abyss and become infected with the Pus of Man, a writhing gigantic snake-like mass of darkness.
</li><li> Vordt and the Dancer of the Boreal Valley and the other Boreal Knights were all turned into bestial horrors by the bewitched rings Pontiff Sulyvahn bestowed upon them. This was deliberate on his part &mdash; all of them were people he deemed politically inconvenient. It's implied that the monstrous Sulyvahn Beasts encountered as minibosses are the final stage of the transformation.
</li><li> One of the Lords of Cinder, Aldrich, used to be a human priest. But then he had dreams of the Deep and bloated like a pig as he consumed more and more people. He is now a mass of filthy black sludge known as the Saint of the Deep.
</li><li> Oceiros was once the king of Lothric. His obsession with the knowledge of dragonkind <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">specifically that of the Paledrake Seath the Scaleless</span> eventually caused him to mutate into a grotesque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraconicHumanoid">Draconic Humanoid</a> bearing an eerie resemblance <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to Seath</span>.

</li><li> Illidan's got nothing on, well, every race on Azeroth AND beyond. Firstly, those that play it straight:

The funny thing about Eredar is that they're physically not all that transformed; they look demonic because their ancestors already looked about like that, as do the good guy Draenei now.
</li><li> The Forsaken were the humans who were stricken with a plague of undeath.
</li><li> The Fal'dorei are demonic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderPeople">Spider People</a> who were originally elven Shal'dorei. The fountain of arcane energy they drew upon exploded, twisting them into their current forms.

Earthen became dwarves, mechagnomes became regular gnomes, and Vrykul became Humans</span>. These are all inversions since the transformations go from "monster" to man.
</li><li> There is a theory that Night Elves (from which all other elves are descended) descended themselves from Trolls who were exposed to the arcane energies of the Well of Eternity, once more inverting the trope. This is confirmed in the new Chronicles book.
</li><li> All but a small few of the demonic races were once regular beings that became so tainted by fel energy they eventually became full demons, usually caused by direct interference by the Burning Legion as an assimilation plot. Many night elves became full demons in the form of satyrs and many other races became part-way demonic such as chaos orcs and the felblood elves through similar corruption. The eredar are an odd case because the majority of the species became demons after siding with the Legion while a minority fled and became draenei, which is different because the previous cases had mainly the minority of their race become demonic. Only a few races like the Nathrezim are confirmed to be originally demonic.

His back story is fleshed out as the comic progressed, and so far the only really bad thing he ever did in his <em>life</em> he repented halfway through and ran away to sacrifice himself heroically. May be the only being in hell not rightfully damned there.
<ul><li> Demon!Karnak, however, is both evil and a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, although he <em>has</em> been having some character development. Had a Rorschach Moment in December 2010 and appointed himself <em>Warden</em> of Hell and informed the damned that they were all trapped in there with him.
</li><li> Without becoming much less despicable, Karnak in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">last couple years</a> has scaled the heights of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Crazy Awesome</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody">Siggy-flail</a> was choice, as was his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> at his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> trial. And then there's the simple things:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Karnak:</strong> [dramatic slaughter montage, final panel thought bubble] <em>I hate this place.</em>
</div></li><li> A more typical progression of this is probably provided by Lady Loxo, who used to be soulbound to the Demon of Treachery back before Karnak exploded Hell into submission, and who becomes all serpentine and scaly after beginning to consume souls out of the 'feeding pits.' Bulgak Adrak is much more conflicted and his transformation doesn't progress nearly so smoothly, even once he gives in. Then he has an epiphany and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">his soul explodes</a>.
</li><li> Then there's TIM, the eyeless, nameless infernomancer who provided the first evil in the comic and <em>kept coming back</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">new levels</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>.
</li><li> This trope is <em>not</em> applied to benevolent synthetic entities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">Quilt and Acibek</a> who were made out of unwilling human victims. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>, possibly, but while the Acibek thing was tragic and the Quilt thing creepy, the focus is intentionally on who they themselves are, not their antecedents.

The good news is that the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> keeps forgetting to include a brainwashing function when he transforms his test subjects, and the few he <em>did</em> brainwash during the change broke free after a while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperRobotMonkeyTeamHyperForceGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperRobotMonkeyTeamHyperForceGo">Super Robot Monkey Team Hyper Force Go</a></em>: Skeleton King was once a kind-hearted man called the Alchemist, who in fact was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">the one who created the monkey team</a> to combat the monster he became. What makes his case really sad was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralTransformation">his transformation wasn't by choice</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, the Turtles find an underground community of monsters who were once human, victims of the Foot Clan who were transformed into these creatures to mine valuable minerals. They get lucky, however; it takes many episodes, but Donatello is eventually able to find a permanent cure. Of course, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">mutants</a> are one of its main concepts, the trope appears in some way, shape or form in pretty much every iteration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">the franchise</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a></em>: It is shown that the "Conductor" uses a Orb Cannon to transform others into life sucking creatures called Ghoms. Because of this, it is implied that the Ghoms we see in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/InfinityTrainS1E1TheGridCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/InfinityTrainS1E1TheGridCar">The Grid Car</a> were once other Passengers.
