</p><div class="indent"><em>"Anytime a hero is somehow outpowered and/or outclassed by the villain, he will invariably release powers/new moves he never knew he could accomplish... but his old teacher did!"</em>
<div class="indent">&mdash; <strong><a class="urllink" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~duongsaa/more_htm/jk_100animeRules.htm">The 100 Rules of Anime<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></strong>: <em>#84 The Law of Dormant Powers</em>
</div></div><p>Some superhero comics authors seem to get bored of the same old powers. They add new ones to the same characters whenever they feel that a new power would open up a new story, or a new danger needs a new response, or what the hell, whenever they feel like it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a>, a power upgrade or some bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> is employed to explain the new power, but often the character just does something they've never done before and when their friends say, "I didn't know you could do that!", they come back with either "I've never needed to, till now," or worse, "Neither did I!"
</p><p>Generally speaking, this trope is far more forgivable earlier in the story &#151; with a character who has only recently been empowered and is fully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">not knowing what he can do</a>. Likewise, "neither did I until now" in an experienced character can be reasonable, if it's happening in some circumstance or special condition that the character has never encountered before.
</p><p>However, this is sometimes employed as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> &#151; having written themselves into a corner with a villain or situation that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheAuthorCanSaveThemNow">too overwhelming for our heroes to handle</a> with the tools they've been given, the writer decides to have the hero instantaneously learn the one ability he needs to save the day or bring a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>. Frequently, without any form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> to suggest that he or she can do that. It gets worse if they conveniently forget this ability when it would come in handy in a later situation. This is often the case with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu">Marty Stu</a>.

See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility">Adaptive Ability</a>, where your power is the acquisition of new powers/immunities. When the new ability is something overly narrow or silly, this often leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlightStrengthHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlightStrengthHeart">Flight, Strength, Heart</a>, as was common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">The Silver Age of Comic Books</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">Suddenly Always Knew That</a> is the same type of retcon as this, but instead of "Neither did I", the character will explain that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">You Didn't Ask</a>.
</p><p>An inherent power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Science Heroes</a> &#151; they're <em>supposed</em> to be building bizarre devices to deal with bizarre circumstances. It only gets annoying if the writer can't come up with a reason the guy would have that precise device on his person at that precise moment &#151; other than him just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">crazy</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicWizard">Wizards, witches, sorcerors, and other assorted magic users</a> tend to have this as an inherent power too for similar reasons &#151; they are likely to carry around a spellbook containing a huge variety of spells (or they may have memorized them all), and it makes sense for them not to mention the more situational ones until they need it. Characters with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon">Morph Weapon</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower">Swiss-Army Superpower</a> justify this by being able adjust their attacks, potentially coming up with new ways to use their existing powers.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Not all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSuperPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSuperPower">New Super Powers</a> fall into this category; for example, a character undergoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeToUnlockMoreTruePotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeToUnlockMoreTruePotential">Unlock More True Potential</a> is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">New Powers as the Plot Demands</a>.
</p><p>This trope is among the more dangerous examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingPitfallIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingPitfallIndex">bad writing</a> when an author is trying to tell an engaging story. Not only is it a pretty good way to break the audience's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a>, but it also subconsciously informs the audience that neither the characters nor the plot itself are bound by any consistent set of rules or limitations. This in turn can remove any and all feeling of tension from the overall narrative (and consequently cause the audience to <em>stop caring</em> about the characters) because there is no longer any reassurance that some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> <em>isn't</em> going to resolve whatever conflict presents itself. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/OlI3_K-G9cU?t=3821">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> explains it pretty well.
</p><p>See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a> when this trope happens during the climax.

Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>, where the plot demands the character's powers and abilities are suddenly rendered impotent; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmySuperpower">Swiss-Army Superpower</a>, where a character has a very limited set of powers or skills and uses creativity to meet the needs of the plot.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>:
<ul><li> Superman started out faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and invulnerable to anything less than a bomb. Since then he's learned to fly, to blow like a hurricane, to survive nuclear explosions (though just barely), chill things with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreath">puff of breath</a>, shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">lasers from his eyes</a>, and use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRayVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRayVision">X-Ray Vision</a>. And that's just the powers that have lasted.
</li><li> Interestingly, a lot of this stems from various media adaptations, particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons">Superman Theatrical Cartoon</a> shorts; originally the brothers Fleischer <em>wanted</em> to stick close to a relatively limited powerset, but animating him just "leaping" everywhere was time-consuming and expensive (even with their extravagant-for-the-time budget), so they asked DC "can we just make him fly?" DC said "Sure", he flew in the cartoons which introduced a ton of people to the character who then bought the comic and complained to DC, asking why Superman didn't fly like he did in the cartoon... and, well, we were off to the Super-races.
</li><li> Superman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> counterpart Ultraman (no, not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries">that</a></em> Ultraman) actually has this as his superpower: exposure to Kryptonite, rather than harming him, causes him to develop new abilities (at least in his first appearance. Later on this was changed to Kryptonite being necessary to sustain his full levels of power).
</li><li> And Red Kryptonite (occasionally, in some continuities) lets the "regular" Superman develop new abilities, albeit temporary ones.
</li><li> Van-Zee, Superman's lookalike from Kandor, demonstrates <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/gtL6nzP.jpg">Super Weaving<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. He's just using super speed to, er, weave really really fast.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhoTookTheSuperOutOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhoTookTheSuperOutOfSuperman">Who Took the Super out of Superman?</a></em>. After Superman has put several bank robbers down, the stolen cash starts swirling upwards mysteriously, and a crook believes Superman -who had nothing to do with it- is showing off some new strange power.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bank Robber:</strong> Th-The money... swirling around&mdash;! Some kinda new Superman trick, I bet!
</div></li><li> In one strip, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> is going blind and she wants to see a play based on herself before this happens. But the play is only a script, so Superman uses super-puppetry to make it appear that actors are performing on stage (Lois' vision is blurred so she doesn't notice). He also uses "super-memory" to learn the script, even though he could just <em>read</em> it given that he's offstage.
</li><li> Other silver age classic powers: super-hypnotism, super-kissing (don't ask, really), and super-mimicry.
</li><li> "Super-hypnotism" &mdash; though not called that at the time &mdash; was actually acquired at a very early point, certainly by 1940 at the latest (he hypnotizes Lois in at least two different stories that year alone.)
</li><li> The original TV show mostly restrained itself from this, but huffed this trope twice, once to give Superman the ability to phase through walls, and once to let him split himself into <strike>multiple</strike> two Supermen. Both of these powers vanished after the episode. The splitting ability came from his dense molecular structure (at the time, the explanation for his invulnerability) meaning he had enough mass to make up two normal people. The two were significantly weaker than when they were together creating dramatic tension when they couldn't merge.
</li><li> In one episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a>, Superman teams up with Robin to search for Batman, and displays his super-mimicry, explained as him having extraordinary control of his vocal muscles, to first mimic Batman, then Robin himself. This completely freaks Robin out, and he demands that Supes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayThatAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayThatAgain">"Never. Do that. Again."</a> Superman never uses this power again.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://comiccoverage.typepad.com/comic_coverage/superpowers-that-time-forgot/">There's plenty more examples from the comics.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The basic assumption was that, for any ability a normal man might have, Superman could do it or learn to do it much better. If a man can blow out a candle, then Superman can blow out a forest fire. The problem lay in that the writers didn't consider how ventriloquism or hypnotism really work, so Superman was shown <em>literally</em> throwing his voice, or hypnotizing people almost effortlessly.
</li><li> The time travel ability is a logical extension of the fact that they'd already established he could fly faster than light; the real question is how he ever broke the light barrier <em>without</em> time traveling.
</li><li> This didn't end with the Silver Age by the way. The modern Superman has been shown to use the psychic martial art of Torquasm-Vo which in one instance allowed him to <em>alter reality</em>.
</li><li> Superman's set of powers, while extensive in number, were actually fairly set in stone by the early 1960s, when heat vision (the last major power addition) became a stand-alone power from his x-ray vision, and the yellow sun explanation for his powers came into use. (He'd use "the heat of his x-ray vision" to melt things in 50s stories.) The above mentions of "super-weaving"/"super-puppetry"/etc. are just using his usual powers (super-speed, etc.) to do some task in a creative manner, and not actual "powers." The <em>extent</em> of his powers, especially invulnerability and strength, were reduced post-1960s (and especially in the Byrne revamp), with a few powers outright tossed out by Byrne (in particular, time-travel and interstellar travel using his super-speed, super-hypnosis, and super-ventriloquism). The ability to use his super-breath to create freeze breath apparently fell prey to this for awhile, until it was brought back in 2000s stories.
</li><li> Not that there weren't outright inexplicable new powers sometimes. In one issue, he managed to <em>rewire complex circuitry</em> with his vision to stop some evil machinery of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a>'s, and another time he somehow used his vision to attempt a <em>phone trace.</em> It's especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> with Silver Age Superman <em>because</em> of the number and extent of his established powers.
</li><li> This applies to some of his supporting cast as well. In an old issue of <em>Superman Family</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> assumes the identity of a Russian ballerina after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggedForDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggedForDisguise">knocking her out and leaving her bound and gagged in a closet</a>. She's suddenly able to dance well enough to fool the audience <em>and</em> the other Russians, which she attributes to years of ballet lessons she supposedly had as a child.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> was created in the late Silver Age and she was so overpowered like her cousin, she was not liable to come up with new powers every issue. Still she had super-intuition -a power unique to her-, used super-ventiloquism, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a> #258</em> she used super-aiming and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl1972" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl1972">Supergirl Vol 1</a></em> issue #1 she uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacuumMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacuumMouth">Super-Suction Breath</a> to capture a serial killer (she draws out the air out of a cab so the man in there faints).
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005">Supergirl (2005)</a></em> storyline "Way of the World". Supergirl fights a villain that at one point brags about his new powers:
<div class="indent"><strong>Luzano:</strong> Hyper-Strength! Hyper-Speed! Plasmagenesis! Yes, that's a word! Hyper-sensual perception! <br><strong>Supergirl:</strong> (incredulous) "Hyper-sensual"?
</div></li><li> Parodied in the third issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupergirlCosmicAdventuresInThe8thGrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupergirlCosmicAdventuresInThe8thGrade">Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade</a></em> when Linda tries to gain new powers combining different types of Kryptonite. She gains a bunch of useless powers until she gets something useful after several attempts:

Then again, it's not surprising that he'd be unaware of a power he had to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly">die</a></em> to use.

<ul><li> Marrow had her heart torn off her body by Storm, but later was revealed to be alive. How? Spare heart.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> can slip into this herself (her use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">lightning in increasingly improbable ways</a> qualifies), it even bleeds into other adaptations. For instance, an episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a></em> cartoon had her able to use Cerebro, despite it usually only working for telepaths. One old comic by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> also suddenly gave Storm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a>, because she could feel the effect everyone around her had on the local air pressure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> started off with the ability to control metal magnetically, then developed the ability to fly with a reasonable enough explanation. Then, as stories became more ambitious, he was suddenly able to control the entire electromagnetic spectrum, which effectively made him invincible, so long as no one managed to get in a cheap shot. He could even go toe to toe with the freaking Phoenix (admittedly, this was before the retcon of the Phoenix being a vastly powerful cosmic entity, but even so, it's no mean feat)! Of course, then there's the <em>Planet X</em> story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>, in which he's powerful enough to (somehow) control gravity and <em>time.</em> (Grand Unified Theory?) Of course, in that case, he was retconned into being Xorn posing as Magneto, while the real Magneto was living in the ruins of Genosha. However, stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersDisassembled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersDisassembled">Avengers Disassembled</a></em> when he demonstrated the ability to basically stargate across continents to get his daughter, which are canonically him, don't under-sell his ludicrously vast pwers. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum">Ultimatum</a>, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> Magneto is able to use his powers to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shift the magnetic poles of the Earth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">which causes massive weather shifts, which causes massive tidal waves to destroy almost all of the East Coast</a>.</span> Admittedly, he needed Mjolnir to do it.
</li><li> For a brief period during the Silver Age, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> suddenly gained the ability to fly by vibrating his legs. The writers ditched this idea pretty quickly, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> used this trope by <strike>an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a></strike> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">Cerebus Retcon</a> in his run on <em>X-Men</em> by introducing "secondary mutations", which would grant entirely new sets of powers to mutants, even years after they first gained their powers. This was his excuse for letting Emma Frost turn into living diamond for no obvious reason besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out later that Emma was given that ability by Cassandra Nova so she could survive the Mega Sentinel attack as part of her plan to return if defeated. However, <em>other</em> characters get interesting (or terrifying) secondary mutations too.</span>
</li><li> Dave Cockrum used to drive Claremont nuts by constantly giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> new powers almost every issue back in the earlier X-Men days. Such as invisibility in shadows, or wallcrawling (the first of which got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianRetcon">Orwellian-retconned</a> in reprints, with the latter just being quietly dropped)
</li><li> Professor Xavier's less-seen powers include telekinesis and the ability to give other people telepathy.
</li><li> As originally written pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix">Phoenix</a> was merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>'s "ultimate potential as a psi." She'd never shown that she was capable of that level of power before, and later stories brought in outside influences, but originally Jean spontaneously unlocked awesome powers when faced with death.
</li><li> Darwin, whose body will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility">evolve on the fly to meet the problems in the situation</a>, even though Darwin has no control over what evolves or how it works. Lampshaded during <em>World War Hulk</em> when his power decided the best defense against a rampaging Hulk was...to not be there, as illustrated by his teleporting away. Which was pretty brilliant, although the power originally created a Gamma Energy Draining power to drain power from the Hulk to weaken him, but the Hulk is one of those sorts who fit the 'generates more energy than the enemy can hope to drain' trope so Darwin was getting nowhere and after being knocked unconscious by the Hulk his power reasoned it had no hope of defending against the Hulk directly and got Darwin several states away where it was relatively safe.
</li><li> Similarly, the mutant Lifeguard will develop whatever power <em>will be</em> necessary next to save lives. So, unconscious precognitive adaptation. Like Darwin, it sometimes turns out that gaining the power necessary to save lives <em>doesn't</em> mean gaining the power necessary to <em>defeat the enemy.</em> On top of that, apparently, it only helps her save <em>other</em> people's lives. As often as Darwin she is more inconvenienced by a power she gains, or must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">make creative use of something</a> that isn't the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> she'd rather have had.

<ul><li> Ra's Al Ghul set the Moon on a collision course with the Earth. This gave off "hypertaxis energy", which caused humans to evolve to survive a threat before it happened.
</li><li> Tyroc had the power to warp reality with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">screams</a>. (Of course, this made the "screaming" part just color... no pun intended.) He could do nearly anything, from teleportation to pyrokinesis to... making it rain glue. The character was soon written out; common wisdom is that the writers had no idea what to do with him. In his recent reintroduction he seems to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> into having more conventional Banshee/Black Canary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">scream powers</a>.
</li><li> Duplicate Boy had the ability to copy <em>any power he wanted</em>, including those he made up. Of course, his abilities were rarely used properly by the writers. He could copy the powers of anyone he's ever met including multiple powers at the same time much like the Super-Adaptoid. So he was effectively the most powerful being in the 31st Century, which is why they had a 'the rulers of your homeworld deem you must remain here to protect it' restriction on him along with the rest of his team for why he in particular never had an impact against the villains that showed up after his introduction.
</li><li> The villain Nemesis Kid had the ability to temporarily gain whatever power he needed to fight any single opponent. This one was used just as badly; he was killed in hand-to-hand combat by Queen Projectra &mdash; without her using her illusion powers &mdash; the only given reason why his ability didn't provide him with invulnerability as well as immunity to illusions was being too <em>intimidated</em> to concentrate on activating his power. One would suppose he would gain invulnerability against physical attacks against any foe capable of throwing a punch... Nemesis Kid's powers explicitly only worked on one power at a time. That's why Princess Projectra was able to simply beat him to death: His power was occupied nullifying her illusions.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry">The Sentry</a> is one of the more blatant examples of this; at first, he was a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a> with additional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Light 'em Up</a> powers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> (sufficient to wipe everyone's memory of him), albeit strong enough to - with effort - contain a Cosmic Cube. Then his dark side, the Void, demonstrated all sorts of abilities like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">Weather Manipulation</a> and combat tentacles strong enough to break every bone in the Hulk's body. After that, it steadily progressed up to grand scale Molecular Manipulation and being a flat out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> (which goes some way to explaining his constantly changing origin) - there's a reason that one theory about him holds that he's actually a sentient Cosmic Cube, like Kobik. Either way, he can't die unless he wants to, and is only generally restricted by his rampant neuroses. Then he came back from the dead as one of the Apocalypse Twins' Horsemen of Death, totally without the Void (apparently it got bored and left for the White Hot Room) and even crazier and more powerful than ever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> #3 inexplicably gave the Hulk the power to fly, a development so surprising and out of nowhere that <a class="urllink" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_large/11/117763/2464606-hulk003.jpg">it was even referenced on the cover<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a></em> villain "The Quiz" had "every power you haven't thought of". Literally; to fight her, you had to start shouting power names so she couldn't use them.
<ul><li> Gives you a bit of fridge logic as to why declaring 'the power to have every power I haven't thought of' wouldn't eliminate the power and render her powerless since she can't have any power you've thought of and her root power is told to you.
<ul><li> Or just rattle off this short list: "The power to breathe underwater. The power to breathe in space. The power to breathe in an atmosphere. The power to survive without breathing."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Inverted in an arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Exiles">Exiles</a></em> in which the team arrives on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Earth where the Skrulls have ruled since the 19th century</a>, and several of them are thrown into a gladiator arena to fight other superpowered beings. Mimic, a mutant with the power to copy and hold onto the abilities of up to five other mutants, strikingly showcases "all four" of his various powers as he fights his way to higher tiers of the arena, until he finally comes up against "The Champion", that universe's version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>. The Skrulls are expecting an epic fight, when Mimic ends it in ten seconds by letting loose optic blasts he copied from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>'s Cyclops. The reader knows he has this power (if he's been paying attention, since Mimic had been using it since the start of the series), but the audience is shocked.
</li><li> While not powers, per se, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> seems to always have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys">that one thing in his utility belt that saves the day</a>, despite there never being mention of it before. This was especially true in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">the TV Show</a> (shark-repellent bat-spray), and on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a> ("You're a mouse? I'll put you in the bat belt mouse compartment!"). Fans have come to expect him to have all sorts of basic toys there (as well as a chunk of kryptonite in a lead-lined pouch because you can't be too careful), and the better writers either have him specifically preparing for a fight or have him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyver</a> a solution out of things you would expect him to have.
<ul><li> In one episode of the TV show, the villains finally wised up and took away his utility belt (they couldn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">just kill him</a> because they needed him to ... extract musk from some weasels). So he asked for a couple of glasses of warm water, this being somehow essential to the musk-extraction process ... and proceeded to pull out <em>dehydrated Bat-utility belt capsules</em> from somwehere and reconstitute them.
</li><li> The writers have also shown that Batman, down in the Batcave, has a set of dossier folders on every single hero and villain on the planet, with detailed plans on how to take down each and every one of them if he ever needed to. This even includes the really, really stupid villains for whom the plan ought to be "oh just kick his ass already."
</li><li> The movies have their share of oddly specific and convenient gadgets, too, such as:
<ul><li> The Bat-Stop-The-Guy-About-To-Drop-Kick-Me-Arm-Apparatus from the 1989 film.
</li><li> The Bat-Ice-Skates and Bat-Heaters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a>.</em>
</li><li> The Bat-Van-Cutter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to his gadgets, Batman has whatever skills will be needed to solve the problem. And those skills have added up over the years to the point where he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">an expert at literally every skill imaginable.</a>
</li><li> The utility belt takes it to a ridiculous degree in the animated movie where the New 52 Justice League fight Darkseid. The League is trying to push Darkseid through a boomtube. Superman and Wonder Woman keep punching him, but he barely moves and just knocks them aside. Batman slaps his belt on Darkseid and it shows a new power - rocket thrusters pops out. The belt pushes him hard, making the belt much stronger than Superman and Wonder Woman combined.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Everything from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Normalman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Normalman">normalman</a></em> was the most powerful being on the planet Levram simply because he could defy all laws of physics, exhibiting a new power at every plot twist. Of course, this is just one of the ways in which he's a parody of Superman. He was also a complete moron, who forgot that he could fly <em>while in midflight</em>.
</li><li> Also from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, Infinity Man had the ill-explained power to bend all natural laws. He can modify the atomic structure of things. Good.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ResurrectionMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ResurrectionMan">Resurrection Man</a>'s powers are <em>literally</em> dictated by the plot; anytime he dies, he'll come back immediately possessing some power that would have allowed him to survive what killed him. Drop him off a cliff, now he can fly, shoot him, now he's bulletproof, etc.
<ul><li> New Spider-Man foe The Freak has the same ability.
</li><li> As does Doomsday, the only monster to ever kill Superman- except he develops new abilities that counter anything that harms him. At one point, he develops bony ear coverings to counter a powerful sonic gun.
<ul><li> Until he is finally undone by the one thing that he evolved that made him weak: Sentience.
</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Superman:</strong> You're different now. You can think for yourself. So think about this. Before, you were a mindless thing. Nothing could hurt you. You couldn't feel pain, much less understand it. But once you have felt it &#151; it changes you &#151; forever. And you'll begin to understand something new. Fear. I've lived with it all my life. You don't want to die again, do you? The agony of what's happened to you affects your speed &#151; your strength... and that little bit of doubt &#151; that you cannot win today &#151; grows.
</div><ul><li> Doomsday's power could be summarized as, each time he dies and comes back, his overall strength and power increase AND he's made immediately and instantaneously invulnerable to and has the capacity to kill or destroy whatever it was that killed him. He doesn't <em>have</em> to die, though: we once see him bashing his way out of a metal box he'd been contained in; his fists grow bony protection and eventually spikes with each punch. He's <em>constantly</em> spawning the fix for whatever challenge lies in his path.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DialHForHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DialHForHero">Dial H for Hero</a></em> is based around a mysterious dial that enables an ordinary person to become a superhero for a short time, by selecting the letters H-E-R-O in order. Each time it is used, the dial causes its possessor to become a superhero with a different name, costume, and powers. The twist here was that the hero usually didn't get a power that would solve whatever problem he was facing in the most obvious and direct way. The trope was played straight, though, in that the power always turned out to be useful for the current situation, even if <em>how</em> it could be useful wasn't apparent at first. The basic plot of a Dial H For Hero story can be summed up as "figure out how being a human slinky helps you put out a forest fire."
</li><li> In the children's comic <em>Korgi,</em> the magic korgi spontaneously develops the ability to breathe fire.
<ul><li> Ivy suddenly reveals that she has wings a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a></em>. These sudden powers are perhaps more jarring because the main story has no dialog whatsoever, and the only indication that the korgis are magical comes from the introduction - we're never given any hint as to <em>how</em> this magic manifests.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JessicaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JessicaJones">Jessica Jones</a> villain the Purple Man was hastily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> to possess a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> to explain how he'd survived getting punched to death by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SubMariner">Namor</a> during the <em>Emperor Doom</em> graphic novel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkhawk">Darkhawk</a></em> is an interesting variant on this trope, in the sense that Chris Powell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowdoIshotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowdoIshotWeb">didn't get an instruction manual along with the fancy amulet that transforms him into Darkhawk</a>, so he ended up discovering many of his powers by trial and error, most notably in reacting to new and stressful situations.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewWarriors">New Warriors</a> had an enemy/ally named Helix, who adapted to <strong>any</strong> threat against his body, be it disease, telekinesis, spider webs, or a beat down from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">multiple super sonic flying, nigh invulnerable, super strong enemies</a>. As soon as he was out of range from whatever threatened him, his body dropped whatever adaptations it developed.
</li><li> The DC villain Paragon has the power to mimic the superpowers of any superhero near to him. But he can also add a twist the originator cannot perform, so he thinks he is superior because he can use any power better.
</li><li> In a non-superheroic example, Thorn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bone">Bone</a></em> displays more and more ludicrous powers as the plot goes on, everything from simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone">Psychic Dreams for Everyone</a> to seeing invisible ghost circles to super-strength to <em>flight</em>. This is because her "true" power is power over <em>dreams</em>, and the awakening of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is bringing the Waking World and the Dreaming closer together.
</li><li> The Engineer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em> is a repeat offender here. Her "powers" are derived from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">"nine pints of liquid machinery"</a> that was developed from a combination of her own research and that of another genius and with which she replaced her blood. It basically means she can create virtually any device she can conceive of on the fly. However, while originally this seemed to be limited to what she could shape out of the actual nanoblood, the scope kept increasing until she could eventually build even very large constructs on-demand, as well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDuplication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDuplication">create duplicates of herself</a> that shared her abilities. The only limit being how many different things she could mentally multitask at one time.
<ul><li> Seth, the ridiculously powerful metahuman sent to kill and otherwise maim the members of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em>, might as well be a walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">superpowered cafeteria.</a> Having been designed to take down the most powerful superhero team in the world, he is given just about every superpower that his creators can imagine, at one point stating that he has powers "that [his enemies] don't even have names for".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> was explicitly intended to be the most powerful superhero in the Marvel Universe, and in the early days this seemed to mean "modeled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>." He whipped out abilities like time travel and even super-ventriloquism on occasion before his powers became more clearly defined. (Though he actually became more powerful <em>after</em> they stopped throwing in weird abilities; in his early adventures he didn't really demonstrate the "Class 100" strength and city-engulfing weather manipulation he's known for now.)
</li><li> A very '90s miniseries called <em>The Psycho,</em> by James Hudnall and Dan Brereton, is set in a world where people gain superpowers by taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">various drugs.</a> At one point, the title character develops the ability to breathe underwater&mdash; or maybe he had it from the start; after all, there's no way of knowing until someone's trapped you in a flooded room...
</li><li> The eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Empowered">Empowered</a> has on at least three occasions demonstrated powers she had no idea her suit possessed: Clinging, surviving in space, and very possibly flight. She's not aware of the third.
<ul><li> Given an interesting twist, in that many times, they are Chekov's guns. She discovers the new power at the BEGINNING of the issue, points out how useless it is, and then uses it LATER to great effect. Another one? Her suit can turn invisible. Not turn HER invisible. The suit ITSELF turns invisible.
</li></ul></li><li> The female <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> character Arisia, a one-time fling of Hal Jordan's, was thought to have perished. She was found years later (somewhat randomly) on the planet Biot in a pod. We were then told that Arisia's species can go into a deep state of mental and physical hibernation while only <em>appearing</em> dead. All this was done so Geoff Johns could put Arisia into the <em>Green Lantern Corp</em> ongoing. Not the most elegant way of bringing someone back to life.
</li><li> Hawk and Dove. Holy crap, Hawk and Dove. Geoff Johns likes them so much that one of them will just have whatever powers they need for the plot to work. Army of unstoppable zombies? Well hey, Dove just happens to have an anti zombie laser inside her. Boyfriend dies? Dove can totally hear ghosts all of a sudden. Dove's in trouble? Hawk just happens to have the ability to sense when Dove's using her powers even though he's never had that power before. Sigh.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sonic's "Super Peel-Out" maneuver became this in the early comics. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicCD">Sonic CD</a></em>, the Super Peel-Out was nothing more than a way to get Sonic to reach high speeds without being a ball. In the comics, it was used for other methods, including limited flight and the ability to deflect attacks.
</li><li> NICOLE, a small handheld device with utilities ranging from a translator, laser device, a protective forcefield and a scanner that can devise info and history from almost any object or area. In later issues NICOLE was evolved into the powerstation for New Mobotropolis from which she can transport or materialize almost any entity to the heroes' convenience, though at least by this point her multiple powers are becoming less of a surprise.

"He followed them into the painting! I didn't know four dimensional ink could do that!" "Well duh! It can probably do whatever story purposes require."
</li><li> At the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy Season 8</a> comics, Buffy gets new powers like flying and super speed due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight</span>.
</li><li> <em>Herbie The Fat Fury</em> got various superpowers from eating lollipops. These powers could be literally anything, from invulnerability and super-strength to hypnotism, talking to animals, time travel, and knocking out uncooperative indian chiefs.
</li><li> The Molecule Man, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> villain, can control molecules, so he can do just about anything, but he's not the brightest bulb in the shed and not completely evil, so he's often beaten before he can really use his imagination.
</li><li> Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> makes even Silver Age Superman look downright consistent by comparison. One week he might say it's impossible to change the past, the next week he might casually rewind time by twirling his little finger and prevent the villain from ever being born. At his worst, it was less a case of him getting new powers as the plot demands, but more a case of him being able to do absolutely anything, <em>unless the plot specifically required that he couldn't.</em> This is probably one of the major reasons why the writers eventually stripped him of his Sorcerer Supreme title and most of his power.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">early issues</a> of Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, the Human Torch would often demonstrate seemingly random new powers all the time. Although all of them were (at least thematically) linked to his ability to control heat and fire, many of them made little sense (some examples include <em>sonar heat waves</em>, creating a lasso made only <em>partially</em> out of fire that could pick up paper objects without burning them, and the ability to surround an object with a coating of fire that could detect and react to someone's <em>human aura</em> in order to guide the object to them.)
</li><li> Eobard Thawne, the Reverse-Flash, after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a>: Rebirth</em>. Suddenly powered by an inexplicable thing called the "Negative Speed Force", he now has the ability to travel back in time at will and change history. He also gained gained Reverse-Flash II's ability to create a sonic boom when he snaps his fingers, something his Speed Force should negate (otherwise every step he takes should do that). He can also... reverse-age himself? What?
<ul><li> On the topic of Flash villains, Mirror Master's powers have never been clearly defined. So as long as whatever he's doing is related to mirrors he can do pretty much anything.

In the comics, it was <em>Kitty</em> who got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leaped</a> into her past self; letting her be the sender allowed her to do more even though it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">naturally</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine</a> who travels. It's still clearly this trope, though, as intangibility has nothing to do with sending a consciousness back in time, and we're not given any idea of how she can suddenly do this.)

<ul><li> In general, most role players have characters with predetermined skills and abilities. If the player characters run into a monster/enemy/whatever that is nigh unkillable, sometimes the storytellers may bestow the characters with a new power to help them combat the threat. While instilling new powers on the fly can help create a more exciting story, it can also seem like a cheap ass pull when done too much (making the player characters look like they can't do anything until the plot says otherwise) or done badly. Leveling can also have this effect in some systems.
</li><li> This is such a prevalent trope in superhero comics that most superhero RPGs have some sort of mechanic to represent it. For instance, the RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> has a Hero Point mechanic that allows you to turn one of your superpowers into another for a single use. While keeping the new power "in theme" with your other abilities is encouraged, it isn't strictly necessary...
<ul><li> There are also the Variable structures, which let you have a pool of points to devote to various powers and that you can reallocate every round, and actual powers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveAbility">Nemesis and Adaptation</a>.
</li><li> And few feats are similarly open-ended. "Jack-of-all-Trades" makes every one of your skills that you don't have points in work as though you had points in it.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> by the aptly-named "Deus Ex Machina Man".
<ul><li> Also, if games use the optional <em>Latent mutant powers</em> rule, the GM is encouraged to throw the players who don't know they have powers into situations where that power would help. While they've had the power the whole time, it certainly seems like this trope for the players.
<ul><li> Of course, like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">lot of things in Paranoia</a>, this often becomes a <em>bad thing</em> because all the players are trying to hide the fact they are mutants.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FantasyCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FantasyCraft">Fantasy Craft</a></em>, based (loosely) on open source elements of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> rules has a feat titled "I can Swim" which allows the player character to place their new skill points at any point before their next level up, instead of doing it right when they gain a new level. This can lead to the same idea, with characters suddenly remembering that they totally always knew advanced mechanics in the same scene that their vehicle or golem breaks down. This is because <em>Fantasy Craft</em> is developed from another system called <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft">Spycraft</a></em>, which also contained this feat (<em>Spycraft</em>, in turn, was loosely based on the <em>D20 Modern</em> rules, but the difference is that <em>Spycraft</em> is actually a good system, unlike its source of influence).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MarvelSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MarvelSuperHeroes">Marvel Super Heroes</a></em> has rules for "stunts," creative uses on a hero's primary superpower. By spending experience points, your character can essentially gain another superpower at reduced cost, as long as it's thematically related to a primary power.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DCHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DCHeroes">DC Heroes</a></em> RPG by Mayfair (later republished by Pulsar Games as the generic superhero game <em>Blood of Heroes</em>) actually included this in a number of game mechanics:
<ul><li> The power "Omni-Power" allowed the user to replicate pretty much any power at the same rank as this power by paying a certain fee (the base cost of a power from character creation).
</li><li> The advantage "Omni-Connection" allowed the character to suddenly pull out a contact of either low level ("My buddy from college is a night watchman there!") or high level ("Wow, Tommy boy did good! He's the CEO!") by paying a fee of 'hero points'
</li><li> Buying "Omni-Gadgets" allowed the player to create one use, nebulously defined gadgets. Upon pulling it out, he declared what the gadget's power was, used it, and it was 'burned out', simulating the ability to pull out "Bat Shark Repellant" by declaring the gadget was Animal Control, for example.
</li><li> Later modifications to the rule set included "Omni-Scholar" (pull a specific area of expertise out of your... utility belt), and other New Powers as the Plot Demands type abilities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> includes the Goblin Vow merit, which basically combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a>, allowing the person to make impromptu deals with various abstract things to gain new (temporary) powers in exchange for either doing something, or refraining from something. Breaking the deal is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">ill-advised</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em> recommends this as a way of unlocking new Transmutations, or even shifting Refinements entirely - your character is on a constant journey of self-discovery, and odds are they won't know just what they're capable of until they're put in a crisis situation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> forgoes the previous edition's actual time-travel magic (which basically did nothing but annoy the other players by undoing their actions and/or splitting the party and made combat impossibly bookkeeping-based) with this trope. Technically what time-sphere spells do still involves time travel, but what the players see is just the end effect: suddenly, the Mage spent all of his time at university studying quantum physics and practicing at the gun range even though five minutes ago he was a poetry major with no hand-eye coordination. Mind arcanum magic can sometimes have a similar effect by pulling previously unknown (mundane) skills out of the group-mind for short periods or stealing them from another character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, any Vampire NPC at the Antediluvian gets a power merely called "Plot Device", which means that can do whatever the Gamer Master needs them to do to advance the plot, as along as they (at least try to) give some explanation rooted in the used Discipline.
</li><li> This is one of the tropes that <em>Badass</em> is built on. Buying new powers just requires a flimsy exposition sequence between action scenes (a journey of self discovery about being a dinosaur the whole time, a training montage of you learning kung fu, whatever). Or if you've got "Little do you know I am actually a ROBOT!", you can buy new powers in the middle of fight scenes just by declaring that you were secretly a robot (or a ninja, or a mad scientist, or a shark, or whatever) the whole time.
</li><li> Following the Batman example under 'Comics', <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> Supers</em> has an advantage for gadgeteer-type superheroes which allows the ill-defined contents of their utility packs to contain just the thing necessary to escape from mortal danger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has this in the Chameleon prestige class and the Factotum. The Chameleon, at second level, has a bonus feat he can change daily to whatever he has the requirements for. The Factotum has a pool of Inspiration Points, which he can use for a buttload of stuff, such as arcane spells, sneak attack, ignoring spell resistance, as needed.
<ul><li> The ultra-cheesy Pun-Pun build uses a customized Manipulate Form to literally grant him any power that it would be beneficial for him to have. This includes anything you can imagine, such as "Pun-Pun cannot be harmed, directly or indirectly. Any act that would harm him automatically fails, at any place and at any given time. Further, Pun-Pun automatically succeeds at anything he attempts."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has the Brawler, a hybrid class that combines the Fighter and the Monk, whose primary class feature is best described as this. As long as they still have access to their Martial Flexibility uses for the day, the Brawler can gain whatever combat feat they could qualify for on the fly, including otherwise-situational combat feats that are very effective for their current fight.
<ul><li> The Book "Ultimate Intrigue" introduces the Brilliant Planner feat, which functions similar to the above-mentioned <em>GURPS</em> advantage, allowing anyone with the feat to pull out a mundane item or have a service that could have conceivably been prepared ahead of time to happen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BigEyesSmallMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BigEyesSmallMouth">Big Eyes, Small Mouth</a></em>: take Unknown Power and hope your GM is feeling lenient.
</li><li> FATE system games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em> or the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DresdenFiles">Dresden Files</a></em> RPG encourage gadgeteers and magic-users to have "undefined" gadgets and mystical artifacts (in the case of <em>Spirit</em>) or potions (<em>Dresden Files</em>), which can be activated later to get a necessary effect at a critical moment. After the story in which they're used, or at certain (GM-decided) intervals within the story, they reset back to undefined.
<ul><li> Many Fate games also suggest players at the beginning of a campaign leave a lot of their character sheet blank, especially for players entirely new to the game. When the party comes up against a new obstacle (be it a locked door or a gang of hostiles), players are then allowed to declare their character always had a skill or aspect relevant to the situation and fill it in, unless their sheet is already completely filled out.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant">Aberrant</a></em>, doing this has a significant chance of warping the character - physically or mentally - due to the source of their powers.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities">Prose Descriptive Qualities</a></em> game <em>Dead Inside</em>, magic powers work this way as characters can learn how to do them by seeing them happen, or are taught by important NPCs (such circumstances which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> obviously controls). One, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype">Shadow</a>, exists largely to let the GM offer new powers whenever players are in a tight spot (such as teaching you how to fly while you're busy falling off a skyscraper), or just to tempt them with convenience, but the Shadow's gifts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">usually have a cost</a>.

<ul><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> tried to avoid this trope with their main bad guys, the Makuta. Since at one point, a huge variety of differently colored and shaped Kraata slugs could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">bought</a>, they had to come up with 42 different powers - one for each kind. Since Kraata are basically physical forms of the Makuta's essence, the writers decided to give these powers to them
<ul><li> They played this trope straight with Artakha, Tren Krom also seems to show off unknown powers (and <em>body parts</em>) at times, but in his case it is justified, since he is just this side of a god, and we barely know him. In the case of the Toa Nuva gaining new powers, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> that they're a special kind of Toa, who have not yet learned all of their abilities.
</li><li> It seemed that Tahu was going to demonstrate this trope at one poine, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> refused to state how many Makuta powers he had absorbed from the Golden Armour. However the story got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">Left Hanging</a> before we could have found out.
</li><li> In the first movie, Kopaka wore a Mask of X-Ray Vision as his standard mask. But Kopaka wasn't in the second movie, and the writers needed someone to see through the floor to advance the plot. So Whenua's Mask of Night Vision got enhanced by them to the point where it functioned both as a flashlight <em>and</em> an x-ray device. In the third, when the characters were mutated into forms that could not use mask powers, it was Nuju who received the ability to see through rock with the help of his built-in mechanical eyepiece. It never displayed this function before and made Whenua's similarly out-of-the-blue ability redundant in retrospect.

At the end of the third season, Ruby activates the secret powers her eyes have, freezing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Grimm Dragon</a>, but not outright killing it, in place and defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>!<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Cinder</a> off-screen.

The next season then reveals that the Four Maidens, legends hyped up throughout the last season, happen to be weak to Silver Eyed Warriors, sidestepping how Cinder could be defeated and crippled despite having stolen the Fall Maiden's powers. However, she's considered a novice by the people who have dealt with her kind before, and as it turns out, her powers might not work on normal humans, giving her a critical weakness.
<ul><li> Recent volumes, however, have showed greater detail: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The reason behind Cinder's weakness to the Silver Eyes is hinted to stem from the Grimm Insect she used to steal the Autumn Maiden's powers &mdash; the insect was seen entering her body to ensure the power transfer, thus Grimm flesh / essence was implanted into her. Further evidence comes from the Volume 5 battle: Cinder was affected by the Silver Eyes, but the Spring Maiden was unharmed by it (though Cinder having had a new Grimm arm grafted on to replace the one she lost to the Volume 3 events certainly didn't help her chances either). Volume 6 heavily implies that the Silver Eyes may have originally come from the God of Light, as it was seen using a similar flash of light to erase several Grimm during a spat with his brother, the God of Darkness whom created the Grimm. Maria Calavera, a former Silver-Eyed wielder, not only helps coach Ruby in learning how to wield their power, but her story also implies that someone was deliberately hunting the Silver-Eyed people down, hence a general lack of concrete evidence on their abilities.</span>

Cheetara's psychic powers, Tygra's illusion abilities, almost anything the Sword of Omens did. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Birdman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Birdman">The Galaxy Trio</a></em> had consistent enough powers for Gravity Girl (play with gravity, usually by making things fly) and Meteor Man (grow parts of body, super strength follows), Vapor Man seemed able to do just about anything by attaching "-vapor" to the end. This included, but was not limited to: combustible vapor, freezing vapor, storm vapor (read: lightning), explosion vapor, and steam.
</li><li> Artha and Beau from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonBooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonBooster">Dragon Booster</a></em> display this a <em>lot</em>. It is explained that Beau has many hidden powers that would manifest themselves with training and experience. This, however, does not explain why the majority of these powers only appear for one episode and then vanish for the rest of the series. Especially jarring in the case of Artha and Beau <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fusing together at the climax of one episode</span>, as the theme of combining abilities was <em>central to the series.</em>
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em>, Doug quickly regrets inviting Skeeter in on creating a story about his superhero alter ego Quailman when Skeeter's own avatar the Silver Skeeter starts pulling powers out of his ass left and right.
<ul><li> His inspiration, the Silver Surfer, is known for doing the exact same thing. Power Cosmic is more or less a ticket to do this.

</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers">Captain Planet</a>, there was the titular hero himself, pulling out new powers out of nowhere anytime he needed to clean up the latest mess.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Omnitrix's ability to repair genetic damage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">talk</a>, first seen in "Max Out".
<ul><li> The Omnitrix's ability to scan new DNA samples, introduced in "Benwolf."
</li><li> The Original Series' portrayal of the Omnitrix's Master Control. Ben unlocks it by accident, and it allows him to transform from alien to alien at will with no time limit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">He also somehow knows how to disable it at the climax of the episode.</a>
</li><li> The Alien Force portrayal of the Master Control also falls into this, as it announces that every single DNA sample is unlocked, but Ben doesn't utilise this.
</li><li> "Secret of the Omnitrix" introduces several Omnitrix functions, including the Self-Destruct sequence and the ability to act as a tracker leading Ben to it's creator.
</li></ul></li><li> The adding of new aliens in the original series almost always worked this way (except for the monster aliens), with their powers just happening to be useful towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>. It would sometimes be done in different ways such as someone with greater knowledge of the Omnitrix unlocking a specific function or just random unlocking from playing around with it
</li><li> Same for Ben himself. The writers decide to give him photographic memory so that he can remember some runes that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> had activated.
</li><li> <em>Alien Force</em> and <em>Ultimate Alien</em> could get pretty bad about this, such at some point showing Waybig with <em>super speed</em>, Chromastone with the power of flight, and Diamondhead with what's essentially telekinesis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> has its moments too: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Malware</a> was initially established as merely being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">absorb technology in order to copy its capacities</a>. Over the course of his story arc, he reveals the abilities to destroy and/or consume Ben's alien forms (who are for the major parts <em>biological</em>) take over a whole planet and grow into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form that is bigger than Way Big.
<ul><li> Then in the <em>Galactic Monster</em> story arc, Lord Transyl suddenly reveals he has the ability to hypnotize people and tries to use it on Ben. Especially ridiculous in that he technically <em>doesn't need</em> such an ability, considering his main power is Mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Not even the Original Series avoided this, as Upgrade suddenly develops the ability to fire a laser out of his optic in "Tourist Trap", and Gwen's latent magical ability is suddenly revealed in "Lucky Girl".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hy7o');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0hy7o" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hy7o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although it takes a few seasons for her to use her magic ability full time.</span>
<ul><li> Gwen's magical/mana abilities often seem to fall into this.

Rex starts out limited to six weapons (jetpack, giant metallic hands, cannon, sword, giant metallic boots, and hover-cycle), but after receiving some phlebotinum in the first season finale, he starts gradually discovering new weapons, such as a whip, axes, and a hoverboard.
</li><li> Cathy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonsterBusterClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonsterBusterClub">Monster Buster Club</a></em> has so many wacky alien powers, it'd be easier to list the ones she <em>doesn't</em> have. She has a stretchy Mr. Fantastic body, can levitate and perform telekinesis, can glow in the dark at will, spins her forearm around like a drill... and many, many more, all conveniently described on the spot as something Rhapsodians (like her) can all do.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em>, Batman uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">astral projection</a> in one episode &mdash; an ability he's never even been hinted at having before, or has used since. He learnt it from monks apparently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotBoy">Robotboy</a></em> does this. When the title character "super-activates", it's as though his circuitry starts running on phlebotnium instead of electricity.

</div><div class="indent"><strong>Professor</strong>: It can do other things! Why shouldn't it?
</div></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a>,</em> "Ice Sore," centers around Blossom discovering that she has ice breath ability, conveniently in time to stop a flaming asteroid from crushing the city. In what might be a deconstruction, she actually notices that her new power is ostracizing her from her sisters and doesn't <em>want</em> to use it to stop the asteroid. She later uses the ice breath in later episodes, although not really more than her other powers.
<ul><li> In another episode ("Nuthin' Special") that focuses on Buttercup's lack of a special power, the girls do a vast array of powers that has never appeared on the show and is never mentioned again. These powers include cloning, teleportation, size change, shape shifting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">bending over backwards in slow motion.</a>
</li><li> In the 2016 episode "Power Up Puff," it's Blossom who is devoid of a power level when Bubbles and Buttercup obtain theirs, and it breaks Blossom's heart.

<ul><li> In <em>Revenge of the Island</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Zoey</a> suddenly gains great athletic ability and strength the episode after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> gets voted off. She's never showed, or even implied, to be that skilled before.

But then in the season after, <em>All Stars</em>, she's back to her usual self and <em>still</em> has all the skills she had during that phase, this time with no consequences and no explanation as to why or how.
</li><li> In <em>World Tour</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Sierra</a> has a set of random skills whenever convenient.

While 21 doesn't quite develop new powers, it seems that he's informed of the costume's latest capability the second it becomes necessary.
<ul><li> Phantom Limb's powers also seem to change from season to season. In the first season, he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> any animate thing by touching it, and this makes veins grow very prominently on their corpse. He still is able to do this in seasons 2, 3 and 4, but the vein effect is replaced by his invisible limbs glowing brightly as he does his thing. In season 4 and onward, he also seems to be able to detach and independently control his limbs, and by the fifth season he has also picked up the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">electrify his arms</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Roger from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> is one of the best examples of this trope you can find, to the point where even <em>Roger</em> is surprised to find out he has certain powers.
<div class="indent"><strong>Roger (after Stan set him on fire):</strong> How did you know I was fireproof, I didn't even know! ... You did know, right?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> does this on occasion. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">the original series</a> Optimus Prime revealed he could mentally control pieces of his body after being disassembled by Megatron. Ironhide sprayed a huge variety of liquids from his sprayer-hand, from glues to liquid nitrogen to firefighting foam to oil to paint, and each liquid would be just what was needed for the situation. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> had Blackarachnia show off telekinesis after becoming a Transmetal 2 (for one quick scene and never again), and there were so many instances of New Weapons As The Plot Demands (in one episode Cheetor pulls a massive missile launcher <em>bigger than he is</em> out of nowhere, fires it once (missing his target and accidentally hitting Optimus), drops it and forgets about it. The various Japanese <em>Transformers</em> series are even worse about it.
<ul><li> Processor-over-matter from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a>,</em> which seems to be concentration/meditation as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a> that allows for telekinesis, is not seen or mentioned until the season 2 finale, where cyber-ninja Prowl uses an incomplete version of the skill to escape some handcuffs that also paralyze the 'bot they're used on. However, the ability is not immediately forgotten and Prowl spends the rest of the series trying to master it, eventually succeeding.
</li></ul></li><li> Near the end of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, Will spontaneously uses the ability to have the Heart of Candracar duplicate itself to fool the bad guys. She never uses this again.
<ul><li> In the second season, all five girls develop secondary powers seemingly out of nowhere&mdash;Hay Lin can become invisible (often something related with the element of air), Taranee can read minds, Cornelia gains telekinesis, Irma gets mind control (though this was first demonstrated early in season 1), and Will can talk to electronic appliances. Will also discovers her real element, thanks to Nerissa, and instead of going with 'the Heart' and 'Rebirth', she can use 'Quintessence'. They also, at the very end of the second season, reach their 'zenith' forms, where they each become pure manifestations of their element. The drawback of this is they very nearly lose their minds in doing so.

<ul><li> Pinkie Pie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Pinkie Sense</a>, despite being common knowledge to everyone who had prior knowledge of her in the show, had never been evident before the episode "Feeling Pinkie Keen", and has seen little screentime afterwards. It almost seems like she only had it to provide that episode's Aesop in teaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Twilight Sparkle</a> to not adhere so rigidly to logic and to what can be explained.
</li><li> As are Pinkie Pie's odd and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warping</a> abilities which pop up at pure random, physics be damned. Flying, melting, stretching, wall-crawling, super speed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HammerSpace">Hammerspace</a>, levitating, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">Offscreen Teleportation</a>, prehensile hair, sprouting extra limbs, the list goes on. Though they're typically used for sight gags, <a class="urllink" href="https://trixiebooru.org/1829858">this scene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <em>School Raze</em> makes it quite clear she actually does have super powers.
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle herself defies the trope constantly. Spells brought out on the spot, such as the one she uses on the parasprites in "Swarm Of The Century", and the Cutie Mark creating one she tries on Apple Bloom, fail or backfire more often than not. The ones that do work are justified by her having researched and practiced them previously. Also, she constantly seems to have merely forgotten about spells she's used without a hitch that could significantly aid the current issue.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></em> is an unusual variant in that Beetlejuice displays all kinds of weird powers, but since the show is a comedy rather than a "good vs. evil" show, it's typically done through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> more than anything else.
</li><li> It's not a "superpower," but similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, the eponymous heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> often got new gadgets as the plot demanded. The worst of them were arguably the cockpit-cutter from "The Giant Bacteria" (a missile specifically tailored for extracting a pilot from his plane, which was never seen again) and the real offender, the Wire-Clipper Missiles from "Night of the Dark Kat," which seemed perfectly tailored for capturing Hard Drive in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a> form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em> abused and lampshaded this trope, including having a button in one episode that was labeled "same button Coop used a minute ago" which, of course, produced a completely different effect.
<ul><li> That happened to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotSensitiveButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotSensitiveButton">Plot-Sensitive Button</a> he ALWAYS used at least once an episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Of all things, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a></em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Redakai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Redakai">Redakai</a></em> in reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicByAnyOtherName">"Inner Kairu"</a> which allows one to perform feats straight out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em>. It is explicitly stated that one's Inner Kairu develops "when the time is right".
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness">Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness</a>, Po gets new powers each time some mystical artifact passes by the Jade Palace which he eventually has to use against some bad guy who wants it (even though he's responsible for causing property damage along the way). Of course, most of these powers are never mentioned again.
</li><li> Mocked in the "Good Time with Weapons" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. When the boys were all playing as ninjas, Cartman kept on giving himself all sorts of powers, much to friends' annoyance.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Kyle:</strong> Okay, hang on guys, I'll use my special power to see into the future, and find out where we should head next.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Cartman:</strong> Hold on you guys, I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Kyle:</strong> God damn it, Cartman, you can't keep making up powers!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Stan:</strong> Yeah, dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Cartman:</strong> I am Bullrog, and I have lots and lots of powers.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode "Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'" has a good and evil version of this trope. For the evil version, in most other episodes, Mr. Burns is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfPlasticine">humorously old and frail</a>; however, in this episode's climax, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">suddenly has the strength to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">kick Bart into the safe and send him overboard</a>. For the good version, it made way for Grandpa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">taking a level in badass</a>.
</li><li> Cronus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOfTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassOfTheTitans">Class of the Titans</a></em> seems to pull new powers out of his godly butt almost every episode, which he would never use again, despite how helpful they might be. Yes, he is a Greek God, but still.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DocMcStuffins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DocMcStuffins">Doc McStuffins</a></em>:
</li><li> "Let the Nightingale Sing" reveals that Doc's magic stethoscope not only can animate toys, but is also apparently capable of transporting both her and them into the real life version of a scene depicted in a book, something apparently even she wasn't sure it could do until she actually tried it and it worked. She's so excited about meeting the real life Florence Nightingale as a child that she decides to double down and break another show convention by revealing the amulet's magical animating powers to her.
<ul><li> In "The Doc McStuffins Christmas Special," she uses it to go back in time a day to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavingChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavingChristmas">save Christmas</a>, another power that had never been mentioned before.
</li></ul></li><li> Gems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> often reveal bizarre powers they'd never used before, which in a few cases are never seen again. Pearl, for instance, has been shown controlling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandBlaster">sand</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">wind</a> in exactly one episode each. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Steven</a>, these powers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSuperpower">things he's discovering along with the audience</a>, but the other gems are implied to have always had these powers and just not used them.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, as the Paladins are new to the Voltron lions and are learning on the fly what they can do, separately and as Voltron.
<ul><li> Less justified is Princess Allura. During the second half of Season One, she seemed to reveal a different Altean ability every other episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> the show starts like this, with Bloom using magic to drive away some shadow beasts, though she never used magic before.
<ul><li> technically the Enchantix is an in-universe example, given that most of the Enchantixes are gained by the fairies putting themselves in situations where they would die if not for their new powers.
</li><li> in the first season Bloom is suddenly able to see people's auras, which is semi-useful for a single episode and then never used again, even in situations in which knowing someone's character is extremely important such as with Avalon or the Wizards of the Black Circle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks">PJ Masks</a></em> has villainess Luna Girl, whose Luna Magnet can do whatever the plot requires it to do, even things it never did before and are most likely never used again. Make her moths grow, control the weather, hypnotize people, create an impenetrable forcefield; you name it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InfinityTrain">Infinity Train</a>.</em> One of the main characters in season two is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Alan Dracula</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearlyNormalAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearlyNormalAnimal">Nearly Normal Deer</a> save for the fact that he randomly pulls out a new superpower at least once per episode. Given his limited intelligence, however, this is as likely to hinder as help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">MT</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableJock">Jesse</a> on their journey through the Train.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder17" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> As mentioned in the Real Life tab in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">Suddenly Always Knew That</a>, many untrained fighters could defeat trained martial artists because they work in intense physical labor which often instills bodily mechanics similar to those found in martial arts. However even untrained fighters who don't work in occupation involving intense labor and knowledge of manipulating tools or physics can suddenly use effective mechanics that trouble trained fighters simply out of instinct. Depending on how committed the person is at not getting beaten down and how aware their state of mind is (IE not ambushed), they can even react out and do moves like a headlock out of nowhere and just using plain common sense. Add to that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">the unpredictability of untrained people who react by instinct</a> (and who don't work in hard labor nor are exposed to violence), this is why even someone peaceful and sheltered like a spoiled princess can defeat trained fighters provided there is aggressive retaliation, commitment not to go down at a few hits, and "instinctual common sense". In some cases even if a person is completely timid and lacks aggressiveness, just out of sheer luck he can unintentionally pin someone to the wall, tackle someone to the ground and split his skull, or gouge an assailant's eye because he's panicking so much he's moving erratically and flailing around or trying to escape out of fear. Panick and instinct really brings out effective movements even if not intentional as seen in how people will block punches as they're flinching and retaliate with an effective shove in an instant in an ambush.
<ul><li> This is why a knife wielding opponent is so dangerous even if untrained. The design of a knife makes it so easy to injure someone even with random flailing movements and tackling in an attempt to escape. There are cases of accidental killings and injuries of people-who aren't panicking and fearful of their life- simply a person wielding a knife doing a clumsy fall or dropping the knife and in turn landing the knife towards a nearby coworker or bystander. Even in a sheath, if by some reason the knife flies out, it can injure a person next to you.
