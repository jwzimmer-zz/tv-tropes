</p><p>It is either that belief or the natural result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, where extra dimensions are added to an existing character to flesh them out and keep them fresh.

The anime actually adds to this by making him able to catch quite a few cards, including Dream, Freeze, Sand and Time. During the second part though, Syaoran loses the cards he collected and Sakura has all of them now, the threats faced by the group were now specifically designed by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not-actual</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to be only subdued if Sakura, specifically, uses the cards, leaving Syaoran to periodically become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeInDistress">Dude In Distress</a>, usually only handy when Sakura needed protecting as she dealt with things.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vegeta starts out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> as an evil and downright sadistic badass, but as time went on and his number of friends increased, so did his overall morality. Even Vegeta seemed to realize he'd been defanged and had made a much better villain than a hero, and purposefully had one of the later villains try to turn him evil again. It didn't seem to quite take; after killing a nameless crowd and brawling a little with Goku, he was back to fighting baddies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and topped it off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. He got better. This is <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>; almost nobody of importance dies &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">permanently</a></span>.
</li><li> This is actually evident with most reformed villains in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">Shonen</a> series. Sticking with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Yamcha was once a feared bandit who rivaled Goku in martial arts prowess. He then spends the rest of the series doing absolutely nothing of importance. Unlike the other heroes below, Yamcha actually ups and retires after getting a hole in his chest by Android #20/Dr. Gero. This is telling that, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, he becomes a baseball player and is the only Z Fighter not to participate in the Universal Survival arc, replaced by Android #17.
</li><li> In Piccolo's introduction to the series, he easily wipes the floor with Goku while in the weakest state he is ever in. He also nearly manages to take over/destroy the world. By the end of DBZ, he is relegated to teaching small children a magical dance, and later plays the straight man in a comic duo (him and Gotenks).
</li><li> Tenshinhan. He was once one of the most powerful characters in the early part of <em>Dragon Ball</em> and was one of the few humans who could match Goku in combat. After he lost to Nappa, however, he was sidelined like several other characters.
</li><li> Even <em>Gohan</em> suffers this, although not in as direct a path as Vegeta. At the beginning of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, he's implied to have great 'hidden power' and this is shown repeatedly throughout the Saiyan and Namek sagas, with him injuring or even fighting evenly with much more powerful opponents for short times. He fades from prominence in the Android and Cell sagas, but all the buildup eventually culminates in him becoming the most powerful character in the series in the Cell Games. By the time the Buu saga rolls around, however, he's a glorified punching bag, and though he eventually makes an attempted return to glory, it lasts about three episodes before he goes back to getting thoroughly destroyed. Kid just could not fill the old man's shoes. Possibly justified in Gohan's case in that he doesn't really <em>want</em> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather">like Goku</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">really just wants to study and be a Salaryman</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Chi-Chi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">wanted.</a> This is taken to its logical extreme come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, when he cannot even hold a basic Super Saiyan form due to neglecting his training for so long. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, after the events of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#145;F&#146;</a></em> adaptation, which had Frieza kill Piccolo because of his stagnation forced the Namekian to save his life, Gohan has decided to get back into training, so it seems that this trope might be subverted for him.</span>
</li><li> The character who suffers from this the most is without a doubt Uub. <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> ends with him being built up to being the one to take Goku's place as protector of Earth. He even merges with Buu to regain the full power of Majin Buu, the strongest villain in the previous series, and yet after all that still gets used as a punching bag. In the end his greatest achievement was killing a few undead Saibaiman and a revived General Rildo.
</li><li> Master Roshi suffers from this in the original <em>Dragon Ball</em> anime. At the start of the series he is one of the strongest people on the planet, even stronger than the protagonist Goku. By the Piccolo Jr. arc he is little more than comic relief. Justified as he admitted his mentor role was over when the new generation surpassed him so he retired. He still gets his badass moments, such as taking on Frieza's army in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#145;F&#146;</a></em> and its <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> adaptation, and in the latter, joins the Tournament of Power and does well, taking out a number of dangerous opponents.
</li><li> Frieza and Cell suffered this in the anime. Though the original manga never featured them again after their deaths, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> between the Cell and Buu Sagas had both once seemly-unbeatable foes get casually beaten by Goku and Pikkon. Then, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, they team up to get revenge on Goku and then are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">quickly beaten by him in under five mintues</a> &mdash; in his base form while de-aged into a child, no less.

<ul><li> Sakura Haruno starts off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> as the first member of Team 7 to go up against an Akatsuki, Sasori. She was hailed as the second coming of Tsunade, who'd she'd eventually surpass with her talent. Come next arc...she's knocked out at the starting bell after Four-Tailed Naruto smacks her hard enough that he almost kills her.

THEN in the next arc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">she hits her lowest low</a>: First she's treated as a ragdoll by Karui and Omoi, getting knocked out.

Then she gets strangled by a weakened Sasuke <em>despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a></em> and needs Naruto to save her from the stab of her own kunai...but because of that, he ends up getting cut by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">that very same kunai</a></em>.
</li><li> Sasuke Uchiha is the main contender for Badass Decay, since Sakura was not full of high expectations as a badass character. At the start of Part II, he was on another level than Naruto, Sakura, and Sai together, and he took over Orochimaru's consciousness when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">he tried to transfer his mind into his</a>, battles the powerful Akatsuki member Deidara one on one and wins (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> escape notwithstanding) and then fights Itachi and manages to impress him and <em>force</em> him to use his trump card, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Susano'o</a> to survive his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Kirin</a>. Then he faces killer bee and...gets pwned even with his full team AND is humiliated when he takes a tentacle of Killer Bee back to Akatsuki. Then he faces the Kages, and puts up an impressive but futile fight against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">the Raikage, A</a> before Gaara needed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">save him</a>. He fights Gaara who blocks all of his Amaterasu strikes without even moving while simultaneously protecting his siblings and Darui. He is then nearly killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Mei Terumi</a> despite having a higher level of Susano'o available, needing White Zetsu to save him. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Obito while playing Madara</a> had to save him from being atomized by Onoki. He managed to get some badass credentials back when he fought and beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Danzo Shimura</a> despite Danzo holding back, the very fact he could hold out against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Izanagi spam</a> even Itachi complimented on. Then come Kakashi...he loses his sight fighting him when he gets Susano'o's final armor. And is nearly stabbed by Sakura in the back. Then in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc">Fourth Shinobi World War Arc</a> he takes down all Zetsus alone but is limited from fighting Kabuto with all power by Itachi.
</li></ul></li><li> Nearly the entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> suffered from this in the transition from manga into the anime.
<ul><li> In the original seven volumes of the manga, Jonouchi/Joey and Honda/Tristan being former gang members was a lot more obvious and only slightly less so later on, as they delivered quite a few beatings to kids their age and full-grown adults. For example, in the original manga, Jonouchi was an adept fighter, even though he wasn't a great gamer, due to living his early teen years as a gang member that had to fight to survive. He beats Bandit Keith up during Duelist Kingdom for trying to steal his cards. In the anime, Bandit Keith beats HIM up and he usually ends up looking like a wannabe thug. Also, the anime likes to put him in dog suits. Notably in the anime's version of Dungeon Dice Monsters, where Otogi/Duke has the chance to humiliate him in this way. Naturally, the manga's version of Yugi didn't let it get to that point. Dark Yugi himself was not someone to mess with, as he previously had a tendency to play Shadow Games with anyone who pissed him off, which usually ended with the loser insane, grievously hurt, or dead that lasted until the end of Duelist Kingdom. Even Anzu/T&eacute;a could throw an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">Armor-Piercing Slap</a> once in a while, and not just for dramatic effect, either. Then the anime and real life card game rolled around, and suddenly Yugi and Jonouchi are settling all their problems with Duel Monsters, while Honda and Anzu are reduced to cheerleaders.
</li><li> Kaiba was also greatly reduced in badassery during his transition from manga to anime, where he spends more time standing around being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> than he does doing actual badass feats. He did have a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">good moments</a> in the first season and in the occasional anime fillers that focus on him, but even those were a step down from trapping Yugi and his friends in a theme park designed specifically to make them die horrific deaths.
</li><li> Mokuba. Again, the franchise from before and after the universe revolved around Duel Monsters can be considered two different series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">curious name similarities</a>. The <em>old</em> Mokuba was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a> and wanted to kill Yugi. He was actually one of the <em>better villains in the series.</em> Most villains do something heinous in a "muggle criminal" sorta way, run afoul of someone the Pharaoh likes, get challenged to a Shadow Game (which is <em>anything</em> a Millennium Item holder challenges you to. Pegasus just suggested that the challenge be his own card game; if you're really the "King of Games," you can win, can't you?) and lose, suffering the Penalty Game the Pharaoh chose to inflict (a curse, sometimes fatal, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">worse,</a> though if he was feeling merciful you may get away with being horribly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Raped</a> with illusions.) That was the formula: "I'm such a badass criminal -&gt; you and your stupid pyramid thingy can't beat me -&gt; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>." And then there were the <em>serious</em> villains. Yes, you're reading this correctly: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Mokuba</a></em> was a frickin' <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Knight of Cerebus</a></strong> in the manga. He bears no resemblance whatsoever to the later Mokuba from the <em>Duel Monsters anime</em>, who exists to (a) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">be the one Kaiba is nice to so we don't hate him</a> and (b) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">get kidnapped</a> - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">a lot</a>.</em>
</li><li> Insector Haga (Weevil Underwood) and Dinosaur Ryuzaki (Rex Raptor) were once lauded as regional champions, and to be feared. However, after their not one, but two defeats at the hands of the protagonists, they became nothing more than comic relief. That is, until they got the superpowered Seal...
</li><li> Jun Manjoume in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> suffers from this in Season 3, but gets better in Season 4.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Aki Izayoi</a> has unambiguously become much less threatening, dangerous, impressive, or actually interesting as a character as the series has progressed.
</li><li> Jack Atlas, who started out the series as the serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Rival</a> but deteriorated to the point in which he contributed little more to the series than to provide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a> with his incessant bickering with Crow and with his suddenly acquired love for cup ramen that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">cried over</a>. However, he averts this trope since the WRGP finals and becomes even more badass as ever.
</li></ul></li><li> The Black Organization in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> can come off as this as of late, due to the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bourbon</span> is actually a spy. While this advances the character beyond the Evil Henchman role, it <em>does</em> come off as if majority of the Organization was, and might likely still be, filled with nothing but spies, people who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">presumed dead</a> and others who aren't as evil as one would think of them, including Vermouth who seems to have a real soft-spot for Conan. The only real threat that still seems to remain in the Organization is Gin, who is getting close to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSue">Villain Sue</a> category.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a>:</em> This possibly happened to Tokiya Mikagami, who was at first a completely ruthless man driven for revenge, and in the Ura Butou Satsujin, he manages to give out many great performances. Come to the latter arcs of the manga, however, although time by time, he did <em>awesomely</em>, he also often became the recipient of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressBall">Distress Ball</a>, turning into him into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">Distressed Dude</a> TWICE.
<ul><li> Mikagami never really decayed, he evolved into a more interesting and complete person. His whole character arc never robbed him of his power or cool head but granted him a truly memorable opponent who actually not only defeated him but changed him. The perception of badass decay comes from the flanderization of his stoicism in the anime. In the manga he was one of the funniest characters as he was the ultimate straight man, whereas the anime showed him as a personality challenged bishonen.
</li><li> However, despite evolving into a more interesting, the fact that after the tournament, his record of fighting consist of either getting an off-screen beat up and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">Distressed Dude</a> still counts as a Badass Decay. It was his Badassery that decayed, not his character overall.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few members of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em> cast display this over the period of the third Great Guardians season. Most notably Kan'u Unchou suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> so badly that it cripples her badass status and she becomes mostly unrecognizable for the first few episodes. See also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryofu Housen</span>'s display of this through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">Loss of Identity</a>. Thankfully they "get better" later in the season.
</li><li> A rare "objective" take on this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em>: Ogisu <em>thinks</em> he's suffering from this. Essentially he doubts if he is Badass because he keeps being defeated in battle once he transfers into a new school despite being undefeated previously. He <em>is</em> Badass but Ogisu is simply being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a>.
</li><li> Pictured above is Joseph Joestar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, a once-fearsome and competent Hamon user, and later Stand user, reduced to a senile, absent-minded elder by the time of the fourth part of the series. In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>, he's simply too old to reclaim his former glory in Part 4 (He's pushing 80). That said, he's still shows that even when he's old and feeble, he's still a Joestar and has his badass moments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Manga Gendo makes for a debatable case, as he's much more emo and pathetic compared to his anime version but also much more cynical, cruel and insane. The same charge has been laid over his confession that he's a pile of self-hate with a social phobia in the end.
</li><li> Some view Asuka's descent into madness as Badass Decay too, as she was established as an incredibly assertive and combative character, but then again, it also helped make her one of the show's biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobies</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Nanael from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a></em> seems to have gotten this treatment. Ever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, she one time surprisingly decides to take on three major demons all by herself, easily defeating them. Later she loses all too easily against <em>one</em> of them in battle.
<ul><li> When entering the tournament she was given a bottle of milk by the head angel that would drain her of power if spilled. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">She quickly ends up spilling most of it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ash suffers from this himself up to BW. At the end of each region or so, the guy's at the top of his game, taking down fully evolved Pok&eacute;mon with ease, and in the case of DP, singlehandedly taking on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">a Mythical Pok&eacute;mon</a> with Pikachu and fighting it to a draw. Then Ash dumps his entire team (and apparently Pikachu's levels) with Oak. Pikachu then goes on to having a hard time dealing with baby Pok&eacute;mon. Averted with the BW-XY transition, however: Ash lost a great deal of his badassery in BW, only to gain them back again in the first two episodes of XY. By the second episode of XY he took on (and successfully tamed) a rampaging Garchomp with just himself, his Pikachu, and his Froakie.
<ul><li> In Pikachu's defence, it should be noted that the opening scenes of Advanced, D&amp;P and B&amp;W open with Pikachu suffering from an unexplained illness, taking a beating in an accident and briefly losing his electrical attacks after an encounter with a legendary Pok&eacute;mon respectively; these events may all account for Pikachu's levels being essentially 'reset' at the start of eachregion.
</li></ul></li><li> Ash's Buizel started out being able to take out Dawn's Piplup, Zoey's Glameow, and Ash's Pikachu one after the other, and showing a sort of joy in beating them. Now, it's a run-of-the-mill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> that, while still enjoying a good scrap, doesn't seem anywhere near as strong as it did in its debut episode.
</li><li> Brock went through this. When introduced, he was a Gym Leader and a genuine threat. After joining Ash and Misty, his character became more and more softened and his battling became less and less frequent. Just by looking at his previous most used Pok&eacute;mon (Onix) and one of his last teams (Happiny and Bonsly), one can start to notice the difference.
</li><li> Team Rocket also qualifies. In the second episode, they were a viable threat, and were even wanted by the police. But as the series progressed, they became less and less of a threat&#133; As of <em>Black and White</em>, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">they've taken a level in badass</a>, and have again become a viable threat. But then in <em>X and Y</em>, their badassery has decreased again.
</li><li> Jessie's Lickitung. It was one of the most powerful Pok&eacute;mon they ever owned; it easily defeated Ash's Bulbasaur, Brock's Vulpix, and Pikachu, before it was eventually defeated by Misty's Psyduck. In later appearances it was defeated easily by Ash's Pok&eacute;mon, especially Pikachu, who previously couldn't even harm it. The only time it came close to the power of it's original appearance was when it took down a Nidoking (Though it needed Team Rocket's other Pok&eacute;mon to slow it down first).
</li><li> Even Gary Oak is an offender. In the first season, Gary was always three steps ahead of Ash, rolling around the region in a Corvette with teenage cheerleaders, acting like a total jerk to Ash whenever they met, flaunting his superiority. Then one day, he loses a match, big time, and it's assumed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> moment, and after that, Gary is far more modest and humble out of nowhere, and only lightly teases Ash. Also, his cheerleaders disappeared. Many fans were outraged. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">He later regained both his ego and his cheerleaders in time for the Johto League tournament.</a> Part of the reason for the change is that the English dub upped Gary's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> behavior but later went with a more Japanese-accurate personality.
</li><li> Though they're rarely individual characters, Legendary Pok&eacute;mon often fall victim to this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessDecay">as weaker/less-impressive iterations appear later on</a> (expect this to happen with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">older Legendaries</a>). Case in point, Lugia: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">first introduced</a> as a powerful and intelligent being capable of calming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a>, the Johto series goes on to show a <em>family</em> of Lugia, none of which are as intelligent or even come close to matching the original's majesty and power. And the physical gods it calmed? They pop up a lot too, with one (Articuno) even being used by a Trainer and defeated by Ash like any other Pok&eacute;mon (albeit with difficulty).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon</a></em>, Angemon was easily the most powerful fighter on the hero's side, able to take out enemies who were at higher stages than himself. His next stage had a one-hit kill, healing moves and he never reached his highest stage for the sake of conflict. In most later Digimon media, Angemon suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>. New mons aren't stronger, Angemon just sucked all the sudden. He gets all sorts of new stages that all get beaten anticlimactically. The only exception is the card game. Also, at the end of the first season Angemon fought the strongest mon by himself while taking care of all the other protagonists, also during a scene in the second season he makes a brief appearance to one-hit several mooks and at the same time showing off his then rival how far behind his league he was.
</li><li> Digimon Adventure 02 often introduced new in-universe rules that were not present in the previous series, and one of these applied to Angemon. He Angemon suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> against Okuwamon, a larger evolution of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss">Warmup Boss</a> from the very first episode of Adventure, the explanation given (at least in the English dub) was that because Okuamon was made from Control Spires, Angemon's Hand of Fate attack (which in Adventure once killed an Ultimate level Digimon, Phantomon, in a single shot) wouldn't even hurt because "it's most effective against evil Digimon". This, despite the fact that Hand of Fate was effective against plenty of Digimon, inherently evil or otherwise (and some, like Red Veggiemon, of which were brought back in 02, but were retconned to be nice as long as they weren't being mind-controlled) in both Adventure and episodes that took place later in 02. Naturally, the Digimon franchise did not make it a habit to apply this rule to other Angel-themed Digimon (of which there are several)
</li><li> Tailmon/Gatomon. In her first appearance, not only has she managed to convince a bunch of <em>Ultimate</em> digimon to join Vamdemon's forces, but she also fights Greymon, Garurumon, Kabuterimon, Togemon and Ikkakumon <em>at the same time</em>, toying with them and not even breaking a sweat. However, after Vamdemon figures out that she is the partner digimon of the Eight Chosen Child and kidnaps her, the only major fighting she does in her Champion form is against a few Bakemon; every other time she either gets beaten immediately or has to evolve to defeat her enemies. Zero Two puts this into full effect where they nerf her powers so much she is basically considered a Rookie level digimon, and doesn't regain her strength until the very last episode of the series.
</li><li> In the first <em>Digimon</em> movie, Omnimon wipes out an army of Diaboromon. In the second <em>Digimon</em> movie, Omnimon can't handle a swarm of Kuramon. Not only is Kuramon Diaboromon's weaker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionPowerup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionPowerup">unevolved form</a>, there were fewer Kuramon than there were Diaboromon, the entire scene makes no sense unless you look at it as the writers fumbling to bring out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">a brand new form.</a>

Zelgadis is the worst offender, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">balanced magic and swordplay</a> combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">stone skin</a>; he's usually the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">who gets taken down or brushed off first</a> later on; earlier he was genuinely threatening.

After the end of that storyline, he was quickly reduced to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> ever after.
</li><li> Even Ichigo went through this. He ends the Soul Society arc being able to beat Captains and he blocks Yami's punch by holding up his sword, then slicing clean through his arm. Mere episodes later he can't even defeat a mook. Then he gets better and ends up being able to destroy the strongest Espada. He then manages to only scratch another Espada with his strongest attack. However, Ichigo's case is rather justified because his power fluctuates greatly (it goes to Hero to Zero and back), and it's based on how focused he is and how seriously he's taking the situation.

<ul><li> Tuxedo Mask also had this problem but mostly in the anime. In the first season he starts out as Sailor Moon's personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, but as the Sailor Team gathers and begins to grow stronger, he starts to fall under this trope, being the only one not to receive power-ups on a regular basis. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> self, on the other hand, performs the inverse, as in that continuity he starts out with no real powers, but manages to get a normal semi-powerful attack spell during the second series.
</li><li> Kunzite is a particularly menacing and dangerous presence in the Dark Kingdom arc of the anime, forming shrewd plans to deal with his enemies and providing a more seasoned and experienced source of aid to his younger partner, Zoisite. After Zoisite dies, he attacks the Sailor Senshi and they just barely survive his onslaught. Then <em>directly</em> after this happens, Kunzite suddenly becomes the "main villain" for an arc and all this goes out the window. He comes up with particularly brainless plans to root out Sailor Moon's identity, all of which target seemingly random traits of women that naturally just cause him to zero in on the <em>wrong girl</em>. He also frequently gets outshone by the evil Endymion/Tuxedo Mask (<em>and that is saying something</em>). Though he <em>does</em> return to being competent for a few episodes once Endymion is put out of commission.

It's a bit early to say whether this trope is really in effect currently as Signum has not really been seen since and the incident could be a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> version of Nanoha and Fate being defeated (and having their Linker Cores stolen) in A's.
<ul><li> Signum has finally shown up again waking up at the hospital with Hayate, Rein, and Agito worried about her and generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">having a sweet reunion with Hayate telling Signum that it's too early to join Reinforce Eins in heaven</a>. While it's not the badass reappearance that many fans probably wanted, Signum still retains her credentials as she completely thrashed Cypha before she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">"Reacted"</a> and the rest of the cast was defeated far worse (Nanoha and Fate were largely unscathed but poor Hayate was impaled completely out of nowhere by Huckebein's leader, who hadn't been seen until then, before she one-shotted Erio and Vita). It seems like a case of this for the main cast combined with absurdly broken villains and faulty new weapons...though there are now hints of a conspiracy involving the company that made those weapons so things are likely more than they seem for now.
</li></ul></li><li> Tokiko Tsumura in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em> started out as a badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a>, capable of holding her own even with a homunculus embryo slowly turning her into a homunculus herself and causing her severe pain whenever she uses her kakugane. And then she defeats Jinnai, and that's her last major victory for a long, long time, and after that she's seemingly delegated to emotional support for Kazuki and chopping up minor mooks. Granted, this wouldn't be as bad, but it definitely reaches its lowest point during the Re-Extermination Arc when she's caught in a massive explosion that splits the group up and is injured and has to be defended from another enemy, while <em>not even trying to defend herself</em> when said enemy suddenly turns around and attacks her. Fortunately, the next fight she's in she finally manages to reverse this trope and pull out another major victory. This is worse in the anime adaptation than the manga, as the anime cut most of Kazuki's side of the Re-Extermination Arc in order to use the time to play up how much of a threat Victor was, including <em>all</em> of Tokiko's fights.
</li><li> In-Universe example: The center theme of one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamEvolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamEvolve">Gundam Evolve</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Char Aznable</a>, after having used his "Quattro Bajeena" alias for a while, beginning to realize he's lost his edge. He has this realization during a training mission where his top-of-the-line, fully loaded Rick Dias is defeated handily by combat data of his old self in a Zaku II armed with <em>just a Heat Hawk</em>. This episode addresses the fact that Quattro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> isn't pulling off insane tricks and inducing pants-wetting at the mere mention of his name like he did in the original series.

<ul><li> Many Logia users in general are this after the Time Skip, because like Smoker, they tend to rely heavily on their respective elemental defenses.

</li><li> Nicky Cavella's first introduction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMAX">The Punisher MAX</a></em> paints him as a suave, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> badass who smooth talks his partners and generally acts like a pretty decent guy (until he gets down to business), yet the mobsters of New York are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">terrified of him</a> and he's done <em>something</em> to put him in charge of the two most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">dangerously</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">psychotic</a> killers in the mob. When his plans come crashing down around him, he isn't so cocky and smooth anymore and runs away while using the man he conned into helping him as a meat shield. Even so, he still seems like a pretty dangerous and effective villain (not least because he subverted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondVillainStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondVillainStupidity">Bond Villain Stupidity</a>). But in his next (and last) appearance, he is the complete opposite of everything that he was in the first comic. He's whiny, stupid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">smug snakeish</a> and just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">creepy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">weird</a>. Readers do get to see his origin story, and one part of it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">horrifyingly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">cool</a>, but overall his badass credentials seem to have been left in his other pair of pants.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JuggernautMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JuggernautMarvelComics">The Juggernaut</a>. For the first three decades of publication history, he was a physically unstoppable villain empowered by the deity Cyttorak. Some of the notable feats include withstanding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">Thor's</a> "godforce" unharmed, an attack that was earlier shown capable of severely injuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Galactus">Galactus</a>. Then during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Onslaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Onslaught">Onslaught</a> the Juggernaut gets a taste of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>, as he is knocked clean across two states and ends up comatose for several days just to show how badass Onslaught is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionDemotion">Things went further downhill as Chuck Austen wrote him as part of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a>. Juggernaut, who before had been capable of going for weeks if not years without air, food, or water, can suddenly drown in Austen's first story featuring him. There was absolutely no explanation for why the Juggernaut was suddenly very stoppable, and later authors have scrambled for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> to explain that. The latest line comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FearItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FearItself">Fear Itself</a>: The Worthy</em>, which says that Juggernaut's power goes "up and down on Cyttorak's whim". That is something that has never happened before, even when the Juggernaut went dimension-hopping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> and tried to kill Cyttorak when coming face to face with him. Or when the Juggernaut screwed up a bet between Cyttorak and other deities in The Eight Day, he was confirmed to still possess unstoppable strength from Cyttorak's enchantments in the follow-up story The Ninth Day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XMenAcolytes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/XMenAcolytes">Exodus</a> was originally created to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>'s successor as the top mutant threat to the X-Men and throughout the first half of the '90s he more than lived up to his lofty claim of being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Magneto's heir in spirit and in power</a>", flattening all of X-Force in just his second appearance before starring as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BloodTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BloodTies">Blood Ties</a></em> crossover in which he effortlessly defeated a fully-armored War Machine, matched and overcame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals">the Eternal</a> Sersi, and in the story's climax fought off virtually the entirety of both the Avengers and X-Men teams singlehandedly while <em>also</em> crushing the entire island of Genosha beneath the force of his telekinesis. Then he succumbed th <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">Orcus on His Throne</a> and spent a few years just sort of sitting around, until the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em> villain Holocaust was transported over to the regular timeline and the decision was made to have him fight Exodus sans his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">show how strong he was</a> (despite Exodus logically being able to defeat him with his telepathy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">if he'd just bothered to use it</a>). Much like Juggernaut above, Exodus would be further dragged downhill by Chuck Austen, who wrote him as a very generic sort of baddie who struggled to match Havok and got told off by one of his own lackies, a teenage elephant boy. Unlike Juggernaut, this bizarre dip in competence has never been addressed, and later appearances only dragged him down further, with <em>Messiah Complex</em> using him as a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> (again) to build up Nightcrawler and Emma Frost. He's been handled with more respect since then, but is still written as being below Magneto in power, despite <em>Bloodties</em> establishing him as Magneto's equal if not superior.
</li><li> Surpassing both Juggernaut and Exodus in the Badass Decay awards is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a>. Originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, Sabretooth first started falling from grace in the mid '90s when Wolvie gave him a forcible lobotomy. He spent some time in the X-Men's care due to this before regaining his original bloodthirsty personality, but the Sabretooth who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a> to Logan was effectively gone. His next appearance had him being pit against Wolverine by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> to see which of them was more fit to be his horseman and being decisively beaten. But then along came (you guessed it) <em>Chuck Austen</em>, who dragged Sabretooth down further into the depths of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a> territory. How harmless? Wolverine and the X-Men <em>laugh at him</em> when he invades the X-Mansion alongside Exodus and Juggernaut above, and a teenage mutant girl with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> at all punches him out. For whatever reason, Chuck Austen seemed to be set on dragging as many Badass X-Men villains down into this as he could before leaving the X-books.
</li><li> Happens on the cosmic scale as well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> and the Celestials have lost A LOT of their aura of invincibility over the decades. Galactus gets trussed up like a turkey and used as fuel for a bomb in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation">Annihilation</a> and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers">JLA/Avengers</a></em> was not only killed by the story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> but <em>hollowed out and used as the Big Bad's fortress</em>. Meanwhile Celestials have died from being eaten from the inside out by Many-Angled Ones during Annihilation and space bugs in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> 2018 edition, Celestials have also died from a single chop done by Thor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers">cursed axe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> was even allowed to kill one OFFSCREEN. The cosmic hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamWarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdamWarlock">Adam Warlock</a> has degenerated from the Marvel U's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">version of Jesus</a> to just another space guy with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">Gladiator</a> has fallen from the preeminent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanSubstitute">Superman Substitute</a> of Marvel to one of the patron saints of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>.
</li><li> In his original appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Roberto Rastapopoulos</a> was portrayed as an actually threatening villain, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> who led a whole drug traffic in the first story arc in the whole series, almost succeeded in killing Tintin at several points. In <em>Fly 714 for Sydney</em>, he is turned into a comical villain who ends up accidentally revealing his whole plan under the effect of a truth serum and get heavily ridiculized, even failing to crush a <em>spider</em>. Might be intentional, however, as Herg&eacute;'s purpose when writing this book was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruct</a> the adventure genre.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> had this happen with Metal Sonic. The "Version 3.0" had started out as something of a big threat. However, in the span of about 75 issues, that threat level disappeared quickly, becoming something of a joke. The fans, Sega and ultimately writer Ian Flynn got tired of that, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a></em> in a lot of crossovers or being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGalleryTransplant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGalleryTransplant">Rogues Gallery Transplant</a> partly for publicity but also his villains fell from grace a while ago. Notable during the Daniel Way run where Deadpool took care of almost all of them without healing factor with ridiculous ease (particularly Slayback and T-Ray, the former giving Deadpool a mental breakdown when he saw him and the latter being his nemesis for a long time, being blown up despite healing factors as good as Deadpool's).
</li><li> Probably the worst case of this in comics comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> baddie Killer Moth. When he was created, he was built up to be the "anti-Batman" and he was genuinely a credible threat to the Caped Crusader. However, his threat level fell apart when he became the target for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a>'s first appearance. After that, he was considered a joke and not even his transformation into Charaxas during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnderworldUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnderworldUnleashed">Underworld Unleashed</a></em> could help save him. About the closest Killer Moth had been in any media to being a credible threat was during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, even if he was being hen-pecked by his spoiled daughter Kitten.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EttaCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EttaCandy">Etta Candy</a> was hit hard by the death of her creator. Wondy's human pal had started out as a plucky, cheerful take no-nonsense, genuinely excellent fighter and leader who had a great sense of humor that tended to catch others off guard, but writers after Marston slimmed her down, prettied her up and made her generic and helpless. She recovered a little bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em> where she was reimagined as a member of the air force but was rather serious and not nearly as excited about or good at fighting. Her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth">Wonder Woman (Rebirth)</a></em> and other modern takes are generally a fine return to form for the leader of the Holiday Girls.
</li><li> Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> solidified the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">"to sell toys"</a> in the fanbase, due to its heavy use of this. In general, when a character with a new toy debuts, they are treated as extremely dangerous and powerful and receive a fair bit of focus. Once their toy is off the shelves, they fall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> and their performance becomes a joke. The most famous such instance was Omega Supreme: in his first appearance, he was so big that other characters came up to his knee, and was strong enough that he fought all of Earth's Decepticons and completely curbstomped them. About thirty issues later, he was maybe a head taller than Blaster, and got taken down offhandedly in a single panel by Buzzsaw, who is about a tenth his size and was actually one of the Decepticons that Omega easily crushed in his first outing.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDameII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDameII">the sequel</a>, he is easily hoodwinked, displays a worse attitude towards the circus folk than toward Gypsies in the original film, and generally gets in the way more than helps.

In the original movie, Gantu was a respected captain in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Galactic Federation</a>. He stood 20 feet tall and was trained well in alien martial arts (and to a lesser extent, hula-dancing). Although he ultimately failed his mission to bring Stitch back to the Federation, he came particularly close, and generally left us with the impression that he was an overall competent, and badass character. Fast forward to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StitchTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StitchTheMovie">later</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LeroyAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LeroyAndStitch">sequels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">the cartoon series</a>, where he becomes a one-man Team Rocket. Gantu has since been fired, works under the employ of <em>an anthropomorphic hamster</em>, and is foiled on repeated occasions by the titular duo. On one occasion, he failed to succeed in an episode's mission when Stitch was incapacitated. He was foiled by <strong>a 6-year-old child</strong>. The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Stitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Stitch">Stitch!</a></em> took him down even further than <em>The Series</em> did. He was indeed rather comedic and most often failed, but he was at least dedicated to his duty of capturing experiments, and he would rather spend time attacking the enemies than eating sandwiches. In <em>Stitch!</em>, his first 'formula episode' appearance has him arguing with Reuben over flavours of sandwich, he cries uncontrollably after a sad moment in a television show (and is upset when H&auml;msterviel switches it off so that he can try to get Gantu to do something), and can hardly ever be said to attack.

That the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a> could fight him to a draw, fans could accept.

It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, though, for people who do their homework; boxing doesn't look as flashy for the cameras, but it <em>is</em> still a disciplined martial art, and even if The Twister was merely a "punk" rather than the toughest, fastest boxer to come over from Britain, it's explicitly shown that the people in charge of the match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">kept changing the rules to put Ip at a disadvantage</a>, and that Ip was forced to improvise when he couldn't rely on his prior training.

A subadult male is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">easily defeated</a> by the <em>Spinosaurus</em> and gets no screen time other than their fight, essentially being replaced by the <em>Spinosaurus</em>. The film's consulting palaeontologist, Jack Horner, believed that the <em>T. rex</em> was a scavenger and the <em>Spinosaurus</em> was really the predatory animal. The idea has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">since been rejected by the palaeontological community</a>, with evidence that <em>T.rex</em> was an active hunter.

It makes some sense, though; he's a scrawny little psychologist with no physical prowess or weapon skills.

</li></ul></li><li> The same can be said about elves. Norse mythology described them as peerless demigodly creatures, living in a world of their own. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Tolkien's Legendarium</a>, they were a race of infinitely living people that surpassed every other race both physically and mystically while also being genuinely good people. They had some spectacular screwups, but still firmly remained the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> of Middle-Earth. They left the world to humanity of their own will as they still had their own heavenly realm to leave for. Oh, and they were pretty much the most badass warriors of the world, fighting armies of not just orcs and trolls but dragons and demons. One of them even crippled the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> in single combat, who was scared to even leave his citadel afterwards.

Their divine connection became pretty much non-existent - video games, in particular, pretty much always asso&#1089;iate themes of angels and/or THE God with humans while elves worship nature or some kind of lesser vaguely pagan deities. In strategy games, they are also known to depend on various allies and fantastic creatures to fight for them, with actual elves being support and commanders.
</li><li> Kisten from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows">The Hollows</a></em> novels suffers from a classic example of this.

Although that may be a failure to realize that he still does as much (if not more) than he does in the movies, but he's occasionally useless compared to his wife, children, and brother-in-law, all of who are extremely gifted in the Force.

</li><li> The Night Watch has a similar problem, it used to be a largely volunteer force with criminals conscripted for sheer numbers. Now there are almost no volunteers, even fewer knights, and numbers are so small they've abandoned most of their fortresses.
</li><li> Cersei is a specific example as well. She was the primary villain in the first book, and was a noted schemer. Her plot to kill Robert Baratheon was very clever in how it came off as an accident. As the books go on, she's presented as more and more incompetent. At least Book 3 has her successfully twisting peoples' arms to testify against Tyrion at his trial. However, when Book 4 comes and presents her perspective, she's shown as a complete moron time and time again. Not only is she seeming to be more pathetic as a plotter, she actually comes off as *less* sympathetic when you see her point of view. In the past she was at least considered a devoted mother, but in Book 4 she seems awfully indifferent about her children except for how it impacts her. In fact, it's presented that since there was a prophecy that said all of her children would die before her, her concern for her children's well-being could have a much more selfish bent. In-Universe, other characters seem to note how awful she's become. Littlefinger predicted that she would ruin the realm, but not nearly as fast as she did. Her brother Jaime begins to wonder why he ever felt attracted to her once he realizes how pathetic and evil she is.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> about the Night's Watch, which has fallen on hard times. It was once a highly-regarded order on par with the Order of Maesters, attracting the best and most elite of Westeros. However, in recent centuries, of the veritable army that once existed to safeguard the realm, only a token militia of less than a thousand men remains, who are mostly the bastard or unfit sons of Lords, along with various criminals, rapists, or those who fought on the wrong side in a war, who join in order to receive a full pardon. They are also severely under-equipped and can only afford to keep <em>three</em> of their nineteen castles along the Wall manned and maintained.
</li><li> Evoked and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> in-universe with Robert Baratheon, who was a mighty warrior. When the series begins he's living on past glories, is too fat for his armor, and spends his days partying and trying not to piss himself.
</li><li> The Kingsguard was once admired as the finest examples of chivalry and combat skill in the realm. Now they are mostly comprised of mediocre fighters and unchivalrous brutes.
</li><li> Jaime goes through this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> as from the beginning of the series onwards he is captured, out-fought by a woman, and finally crippled, losing <em>all</em> of his prodigious skill as a swordsman. By Season 4, even his own father and Cersei regard his career as a Knight as over and Joffrey essentially calls him a has-been.
</li><li> Invoked by Littlefinger regarding the Lannisters; with Tywin and the sheer power of his will gone, all that remains is one-handed Jaime, weak-willed Tommen, and dowager queen Cersei.
</li><li> In-universe with the people from the Iron Islands. Once, they had been the most feared people in Westeros. They had basically conquered the entire Riverlands, which involved beating the shit out of the <em>Stormlords</em>. Then they successfully defeated and drove back the Andals, eventually subsuming <em>them</em> into <em>their</em> society and not the other way around as in the rest of Westeros (even the North's been affected to a certain extent by Andal culture in a way the Iron Islands never have), and built the single strongest fortress in the continent that was only brought low because of fucking <strong>dragons</strong>! And according to legend one of their ancient kings slew a sea dragon. Things went downhill after Aegon the Conqueror burned Harrenhal and helped the river lords drive their ironborn overlords back into the sea. Balon Greyjoy tried to reverse this by seceding from the Seven Kingdoms, but this backfired spectacularly when the Baratheons and their allies beat them into submission.
<ul><li> This is discussed in one of the <em>History and Lore</em> videos. The main problem is not that they've decayed, it's that they stayed still while everyone else got better. Their way of fighting is based entirely on raiding warbands and attacking where the enemy is weak, so against organized enemies who can force a confrontation they catch the wrong end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVsWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVsWarrior">Soldier vs. Warrior</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Varys. At the beginning of the show, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmaster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster">spymaster</a> <em>par excellence</em>. By Season 7, however, he's just...there. His intelligence network must either be composed of amateurs or just nonexistent, because it failed to notice tiny little details like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Euron Greyjoy</a>'s fleet attacking Yara and Theon's ships, and then also slipping up on the fact that House Lannister had abandoned Casterly Rock and was marching on Highgarden, the seat of Targaryen ally House Tyrell, and also the aforemntioned Euron sailing to Casterly Rock to cut off Dany's forces there. Possibly justified, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Qyburn</a> might have taken over Varys' spy network. On the other hand, that shows a very dangerous lack of foresight on Varys' part. Also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp">Adaptational Wimp</a>, given that, in the books, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Varys still has his "little birds", and uses them to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodChancellor">Kevan Lannister</a></span>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Arthur Fonzarelli, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">The Fonzie</a>" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, is first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> and then decayed through the course of the series, but especially after it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark">Jumps The Shark</a>. He ends up being more like a Boys' Club leader than the aloof, antisocial cool guy he started the show as.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cylons in general have avoided badass decay, but Caprica-Six seems to have suffered rather badly. She went from baby mercy-killing in the miniseries to pining for Baltar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">desiring co-existence with humans</a> in <em>Downloaded</em>, though it was clear she cared about Baltar in the miniseries and she wasn't seen again until <em>Downloaded</em> anyway, so its not as if we had much evidence of badassery on her part anyway. That at least led to the scary occupation of New Caprica. After that, unfortunately, she was eventually reduced to surrendering along with Baltar, and sitting in Galactica's brig getting hardly any screen time. It's well-written legitimate character development, up until late season 3 where the writers almost forgot she existed for a time.
</li><li> Starbuck goes through is a little bit in the later seasons, especially when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she dies and comes back</span>. She goes from being the badass Viper pilot to captain of a reconnaissance mission. The biggest sign of this is when she slaps Baltar for revealing a secret about her. In previous seasons she sucker-punched both Tigh and Apollo when provoked, but here she fights like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a>.
</li><li> Arguably done in <em>The Plan</em>, so as to humanize or explain the motives behind the Cylons' titular plot to destroy Galactica. Instead of resorting to outright warfare, the few human Cylons left in the fleet have to resort to cloak-and-dagger tactics while re-evaluating their role as villains. Simon goes from the scheming, mastermind doctor in "The Farm" to a loving family man who would rather kill himself than blow up a ship with his human family on it. Cavil becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">Iron Woobie</a> who laments the continuous failure of his plans, while the Caprican variant of himself eventually becomes disenchanted with their actions, preaches harmony and unity and gets boxed by his fellow model.
</li></ul></li><li> Although never exactly a <em>badass</em>, Norman Clegg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine">Last of the Summer Wine</a></em> began the long-running series as an acerbic philosopher with a dry and pointed sense of humour (as well as functioning as the Ego of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a>). As time has gone on, however, he has become a total wimp: scared stiff of driving cars, terrified of the various female characters (especially Auntie Wainright) and increasingly resigned to whatever madcap scheme his current "leader" has in mind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lord Zedd in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> began life as the "Emperor Of Evil": a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">genuinely terrifying villain</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWayForTheNewVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWayForTheNewVillains">quickly banished the comical Rita Repulsa</a> and proved his magnificence by almost destroying the Rangers' zords, finally stripping Tommy of his Green Ranger powers, and creating his own highly kick-ass zord Serpentera, which <em>towered</em> above the Rangers' own Megazord. Then near the end of the 2nd season he got married to <em>Rita</em>, becoming a more comical villain as the show went on and by the third season the transformation had become complete and he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout">Jaded Washout</a> type character. By next season in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersZeo">Zeo</a></em> he along with the rest of the Morphin baddies are run off by the Machine Empire (His voice actor confirms <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">"Zedd scared small children, so they invoked this trope"</a>.) Ironically, he seems to do better in season three, as he pulls off more evil schemes which may convince the audience that he might even win. How? One of his plans climaxed in entering the Command Center, <em>throne and all</em>.
</li><li> In the first season, Goldar was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and more than a match for the entire team of 5. Jason was capable of trading blows with Goldar, but that was it. But with season two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">more about Tommy than any other cast member</a>, Goldar's character suffered dreadfully. Tommy began to defeat Goldar singlehandedly, but it wasn't just that Tommy's skills were growing. In one episode, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Billy</a></em> was able to kick Goldar around, <em>unmorphed</em>, and that's when it got depressing. One might expect he'd be furious and try to regain his honor, but instead he just turned into a bungling nincompoop.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Rangers</a> tend to decay in time to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">jobbers for the villains</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Toyed with and retconned several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> with Sylar. Several storylines make it look like he's becoming a more sympathetic character until the arc is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">aborted</a> and he snaps back to being a psychopath.
</li><li> When the Time Lords first show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> at the end of the Second Doctor's run, they were mysterious, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">powerful</a>, and threatening to the Doctor. They forced him to regenerate and banished his regenerated self to Earth. Over time, the portrayal of Time Lords changed into that of a stagnant society in decline, who had largely forgotten much of their former power and morality. The downgrading of the Time Lords happened first accidentally and then deliberately. In "The Three Doctors" they appeared as more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Alien</a> than god-like. Then when they re-appeared in "The Deadly Assassin" they fell prey to deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> by writer/script editor Robert Holmes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon">Armed with Canon</a>. Fandom at the time complained about Holmes' story, but it established the trend which later writers took and ran with.
<ul><li> Similarly, the Brigadier, when he first appeared in the late 1960s (real time) took no guff from anyone and the stories portrayed UNIT, the force he led, as an elite team of defenders against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>. He got gradually more comedic and less impressive, though he would regain his reputation later. As did UNIT itself.
</li><li> The Cybermen in the classic era were infamously subject to this. By the time 80's Who rolled around, the Cybermen were routinely being killed with solvents, concentrated fire from Human weapons and most infamously, anything made of gold, from gold dust to gold coins. This appeared to have been rectified in the New Who era. However, later on, they are defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E12NightmareInSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E12NightmareInSilver">a golden ticket</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E12ClosingTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E12ClosingTime">a father's love for his son</a>.
</li><li> The Sontarans suffered a minor version of this-they were almost unarguably more dangerous in the 1970s and 1980s, at one point <em>invading Gallifrey itself,</em> but become a little less badass and rather more comic in stories such as "The Sontaran Stratagem" and "Time of the Doctor." However, they're still quite dangerous, so it's more of a downplayed trope.
</li></ul></li><li> In the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> Curtis Manning was a pure badass, so much that he was called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Black Bauer</a>. In the fifth season he was mostly a doormat compared to Bauer, in the sixth season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was ineffectual until he got killed by Bauer</span>.
</li><li> Tyr Anasazi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> went from being one of the show's best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastards</a> and the only mortal being in the universe that Dylan Hunt couldn't take in a fight to a driveling short-sighted idiot that ended up losing fights to all and sundry, and was ignominiously shot in the back and dropped off a cliff. Some viewers believe that Kevin Sorbo (who played Dylan Hunt) becoming executive producer <em>might</em> have had something to do with this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main character almost succumbed to this in season two, even going so far as planning to turn himself in as the Bay Harbor Butcher, but thankfully changed his mind. As the series went on, Dexter has suffered from Badass Decay anyway. After all, each season charts a new step of emotional development for Dexter, as he discovers that he's not quite as inhuman as his adoptive father led him to believe. As a result, the Dexter at the end of Season 5 is not nearly as dark as his Season 1 counterpart. The series veered in a new direction in Season 7, with Dexter willfully rejecting the Code of Harry and becoming more of a Badass.
</li><li> Hannah suffered from this between season 7 and 8. Initially, she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Dark Action Girl</a> whose MO was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">seduce victims into lowering their guard</a> before poisoning them with rare poisonous plants she breeds in her garden. One of season 7's best moments has to be her murder of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sal Price</span> in this fashion. She then gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> until mid-season 8; upon her return, the audience was disappointed as she was reduced to a weak woman who apparently couldn't take care of herself anymore (which she had been doing since she was 14) and needed Dexter for <em>everything</em>, resulting in her being too dependant of him and eventually leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a>. And the showrunners just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">couldn't get enough of her</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Borg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>. In their first appearance they started carving the Enterprise like a turkey, Borg drones had a personal energy shield that would adapt to enemy weapons fire after other drones would fall, the Picard needed to beg Q for help just to let the ship escape. A single Borg ship (with Picard assimilated) was powerful enough to destroy 39 Federation spaceships in the battle at Wolf 359, break through the Solar System's defense grid and reach Earth orbit. Early on, writers realized that because the original Borg concept was so single-minded they needed to modify some concepts to make for more story potential. The Borg turned to assimilating both people and technology, instead of being their own unique race. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em> introduced the concept of Borg "queens," which while effective for that movie, the Queen inherently humanized them, making simple deception a viable option to deal with them. By the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>, the Borg's bad-assness had decayed so badly that Janeway routinely blew up whole Borg cubes with just a mean stare. However, the Borg did roar back to badass level in the post-<em>Nemesis</em> novel continuity and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>. How badass? Well, let's just say <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlutoIsExpendable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlutoIsExpendable">eating fucking Pluto</a></span> was just the beginning.
</li><li> In the '60s spy series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></em>, heroes Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin are sometimes subject to plot dependent Badass Decay. E.g., in the third act of the third season episode, "The Five Daughters Affair, Part II", Solo and Kuryakin fight THRUSH's "karate killers" (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who despite that name (as given in the credits) do very little actual killing in the episode</span>) for about the sixth time in the two-part adventure. Despite holding their own in several earlier fights with the karate killers, Solo and Kuryakin lose whatever fighting skills they've demonstrated, and are straightway handed their asses by the THRUSH "killers". This is necessary to set up the fourth act's climax and resolution (therefore "plot dependent").
</li><li> Michael Caffee of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Brotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Brotherhood">Brotherhood</a></em> goes from Badass Punisher-like Ear-cutting Irish Mob vigilante to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brain damaged bagman then paranoid drugged mob-boss</span>.
</li><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a> suffered from this in Season 6. Where once there was a badass, sarcastic, biting floating brain, there now stands a love-sick puppy that spouts "emotionally healthy" psychobabble. Most notable in his relationship with Cuddy, which went from mutual messing to confessions of love. Confessions. Of love. From <em>House</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> had some serious decay with the Others. What started as a mysterious group of rogue jungle ninjas was soon revealed to be little more than a bunch of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">commune dwelling nobodies that played football and had a flare for the dramatic</span>. Although shining the spotlight on anything scary will quickly reveal that it's just a branch scratching against a window. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a>.
</li><li> Morgause from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> was simply too intelligent for her own good. In her first appearance she storms into Camelot, takes down several guards, challenges Prince Arthur to a duel, <em>beats him</em>, drops a bombshell about his mother, makes him chase her across the countryside for answers, shows him what may or may not be a real apparition of his mother who tells him that his father was responsible for her death, and then watches from a crystal as he goes storming back to Camelot to kill King Uther in a fit of rage. However, in a show that seems almost pathologically dependent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> and pressing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, Morgause is reduced in season three to a completely ineffectual and one-dimensional villain who plots to overthrow the kingdom with a range of increasingly convoluted plans. If she had been allowed to retain the intelligence and subtlety she had displayed in the second season, she would have been running the place in two seconds flat.
</li><li> Barnabas Collins of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkShadows">Dark Shadows</a></em> was intended to be the latest villain when he first appeared. His first victim was Willie Loomis (who was looking for jewels supposedly buried in the family crypt), turned into his slave. Jason McGuire, who had come to Collinwood to blackmail Elizabeth Stoddard, was one of his first on-screen kills (Jason had brought Loomis with him, and become interested in the jewels Willie sold for Barnabas). He kidnapped and tormented Maggie Evans in an effort to make her into a version of his first love, Josette; killed anyone who got in his way; manipulated Dr. Hoffmann's affection for him, and generally caused mayhem. Then audiences fell in love with him, leading to his transformation into a heroic character.
</li><li> Eric of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> started as a fetishy ruthless powerful vampire with a certain human streak. Badass Decay was predetermined. He stayed Badass three seasons. At season 4 he's been cursed by a group of hobby esoterics, lost his memory along with his personality and has taken to making angsty confessions to Sookie.
<ul><li> It's hardly surprising that Viking Spike got Spikeified.
</li><li> He seems to have gotten back his badassery by the end of the season, when he decapitates three heavily-armed guards in the space of a second, while Bill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stakes the vamp who put him in power</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> was generally accused of this starting with <em>The Black Album</em>, although it wasn't very common until <em>St. Anger</em> &mdash; it was even complete with a documentary showing the previously badass kings of heavy metal going into therapy, and trying to bury the hatchet with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.

</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> began as a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrashMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrashMetal">Thrash</a> band, spending the '80s making fast, heavy songs based on anger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHappiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForHappiness">hedonism</a>, violence and horror. At the beginning of the following decade, Dave Mustaine purged himself of the drug habits the influenced the band's earlier music, and took their thrash sound in a more progressive and accessible direction with <em>Rust in Peace</em> and <em>Countdown to Extinction</em>, which brought the band commercial success and shifted lyrically to weighty political and personal issues. A different, more mature sort of Badass. <br><br>It was after the more somber and introspective <em>Youthanasia</em> that the Decay began to set in; <em>Cryptic Writings</em>, unlike the albums before it, distilled everything about the band into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>, dumbed-down product. The lyrics went from cerebral to childish, the music stripped of its intensity and reduced to simplistic radio fodder. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">nadir</a> was the disastrous <em>Risk</em>, a clumsy attempt at dated pop music that went in all kinds of failed directions. 2001's <em>The World Needs A Hero</em> showed the band attempting to steer themselves back on track but ultimately flopped with both fans and critics. And while the post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> album <em>The System Has Failed</em> did manage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">Win Back some of The Crowd</a>, their best days are still far behind them, as each following release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheSameNowItSucks">merely repeated</a> the same "autopilot" sound of the band banking on their glory days with less creativity and energy.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> itself is an example. Back in the mid-1800s professional wrestling was a real competitive sport, and by the 1900s the highest ranked wrestlers had about the same amount of prestige that boxing and MMA champions have today. Real professional wrestling matches tended to be very slow-paced, however, and the sport slowly worked its way towards being more of a performance art when promoters started making rules to ban long static displays from matches. Promoters then discovered that the best wrestlers weren't necessarily the most marketable, and began fixing matches. By the 1950s, wrestling was more or less entirely predetermined. By the 1990s, wrestlers couldn't even claim prestige, or get endorsements, save a few in national promotions, (WWF <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">Stone Cold</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>) and by the 2000s most champions of national promotions are largely ignored by the general populace, except maybe in their home countries.
</li><li> American wrestlers were probably never thought of the best on the mat or at chain wrestling but used to be held up for great conditioning and work rate. Politically, the region also had a lot of say so in how bookings were done in the rest of the world thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a> being stationed there. By the 1990s, wrestlers in the region were instead known best as showmen, the superior work rates thought to be in Japan and while the NWA remained respected in a few regions, it retained little authority.
</li><li> In the 1930s and 40s, the top women wrestlers in the US were considered equals to the top men. Badass decay started in the 1950s but American based WWWA and AGWA remained the world women's standard. By the mid 1990s, the women wrestlers often had to leave the the US and Americas altogether just to wrestle on the under card and by 2001, promoters looked to Japan to try and get life flowing back. Joshi was inspired by the American scene, but it flipped to Japan having little need for foreigners and Americans wanting to be Joshi.
</li><li> Rip Oliver was the top heel of Oregon during his prime. Across the NWA territories he was known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">The Crippler</a> for being hired to hurt baby faces and cemented his reputation when he was banned from Texas after breaking the hand of Mike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VonErichFamily">Von Erich</a> by dragging him out of the arena and slamming it in a door. The WWF decided the proper way to use him in <em>their</em> territory was as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">jobber</a>. He was buried so throughouly that no promoter ever managed to build him back up to his fomer glory.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> lost a lot of his aura after his feuds with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake Roberts</a>. He next feuded with nothing but sloppy big men such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kamala" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kamala">Kamala</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GiantGonzalez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GiantGonzalez">Giant Gonz&aacute;lez</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlesWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlesWright">Kama the Supreme Fighting Machine</a>, and King Mabel. It took both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Diesel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> beating some badass back into 'Taker to finally get that back.
</li><li> Speaking of Kamala, he's a great example of this. Before his WWF run he was one of the few men to ever bodyslam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">Andr&eacute; the Giant</a>, and when he first debuted in WWF he was a genuinely frightening monster. In the long run he never won any of his feuds (allegedly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> disliked him) and his threat level diminished. Then he got turned face and teamed up with Slick, and that was the end of Kamala being scary.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> mid-2000. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> was put in a feud with midcard wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman">Billy Kidman</a>. Their matches usually consisted of Hogan whaling on Kidman to the point that it resembled child abuse, then something happening to enable Kidman to pick up a fluke win. This was badass decay for BOTH men. Kidman previously was a very popular midcard wrestler, and Hogan was Hogan. Now Kidman resembled a whipping boy, and the Boring Invincible Hero Hogan became a boring almost invincible hero.
</li><li> Without a doubt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>. From the very beginning, Kane made his debut in the then-WWF as an unstoppable monster who destroyed everyone in his path. His badass decay began in the early 2000s when the writers tried to lighten his character up a bit by having him do comical imitations of other wrestlers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a>. His character became considerably lightened up when he tag-teamed with the likes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregoryHelms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregoryHelms">Hurricane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam">Rob Van Dam</a>. Lightening up a wrestler in itself should not destroy their career but Kane's decline was more of a gradual process than something that happened overnight. He soon began jobbing to newly debuting monster heels like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> and losing some of the menace that once made him a force to be reckoned with. Despite that, Kane still carried on as a high-ranking mid-card wrestler at worst, a powerful entity very few wrestlers could defeat without some sort of cheating tactic. Then the shit hit the fan when Triple H accused Kane of being a murderer and a necrophiliac, leading to an awkward and disgusting storyline involving Triple H in a Kane mask having sex with a mannequin corpse in a funeral home. Eventually, Kane was made to finally unmask on live-television in a second feud with Triple H and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a>. It was downhill from there. Nowadays, Kane can be seen jobbing to various wrestlers that he would've demolished back in his masked Big Red Machine days (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry">Mark Henry</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio</a>, etc.) <br><br>Kane started to get better. In a 2010 angle where someone put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> in a vegetative state and Kane going out for revenge, he demolished main eventers on a weekly basis; beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackSwagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackSwagger">Jack Swagger</a> (heavyweight champ at the time), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigShow">Big Show</a>, Mysterio, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>. This included taking on Punk's entire stable, the Straight Edge Society, three on one, and dominating them, and sending Punk running from the arena. All of this without Kane being directly involved in the title picture. Then he won the World Heavyweight Championship from Rey Mysterio out of nowhere. <em>Then</em> it was revealed that <em>he</em> was the one who put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> in a vegetative state out of bitterness at being in his brother's shadow all his career. <em><strong>Then</strong></em> he would respond to his brother's return by Tombstone Piledriving him and getting the best of him at every opportunity. <em><strong>Then</strong></em> he would pin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> easily at Night of Champions. <em><strong>Then</strong></em> he would do it <em>again</em> in a Hell In A Cell match, setting up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulBearer">Paul Bearer</a> to backstab him in the process. <em><strong>Then</strong></em>, he buried him a month later at Bragging Rights! <br><br>After his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AndTheFandomRejoiced/ProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AndTheFandomRejoiced/ProWrestling">remasking</a> in late 2011, he completely got better. For a few months. He gave a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ZackRyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ZackRyder">Zack Ryder</a> on several occasions and got in brutal feuds with Cena and Orton, even defeating Orton cleanly at Wrestlemania. Then decay quickly set in again. A plot involving a crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJLee">AJ Lee</a> ensured that he lost any credibility that he had got back by remasking. He lost at No Way Out, failed to win at Money in the Bank, and was defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> at Summerslam. He was next used for comedy purposes, attending anger management and eventually partnering up with the <em>mega over</em> Daniel Bryan to form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeamHellNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeamHellNo">one of the most memorable tag teams</a> in years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Tazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Tazz">Tazz</a> (or Taz). Initially one of the toughest, most brutal wrestlers in ECW, Tazz made his debut in the then-WWF by giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> his first ever loss. Very soon, however, Tazz's badass decay began when he began feuding with the announcers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a>. After that was over, he became a glorified jobber. Though he did make a small comeback later on by winning the tag team titles with Spike Dudley, it was a little too late by then. After losing the tag team titles, Tazz stopped wrestling and joined the announce team with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole">Michael Cole</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> mentioned in interviews that his talking down to Tazz wasn't right, but Tazz's decline was otherwise justified in that he <em>did</em> have a jacked-up neck that was getting worse over the years; after all he was part of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldust">Goldust</a> came into the WWF in 1995 as a bizarre, effeminate, gold-painted man who would psych people out and trick them to win his matches. When management decided in early 1997 to turn him face, they did so by showing that Goldust was just a character and the man behind him, Dustin Runnels was actually a caring family man. This breaking of the fourth wall turned fans off, and it didn't help that he stopped doing all the weird stuff that made people like him in the first place. Eventually, he reverted back to his old self (after some <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/YWJF5T9.jpg">speed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/Au7AfEf.jpg">bumps<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>) but never had the original success he had as Goldust.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> has undergone a lot of badass decay over the years. One may not notice nowadays with Jericho being pinned left and right by a number of younger generation superstars, but there used to be a time when Jericho was one of the most dominant wrestlers in the WWE who could take down any wrestler who stood in his path, only coming up short against the really big superstars such as The Rock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, Kane, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>. During the Attitude Era, he was known for his incredible mic skills and memorable feuds against Triple H, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, The Rock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>. His badass decay most likely began after Triple H defeated him and took the Undisputed Championship away from him. These days Jericho has been toned down incredibly by both the PG Era and restrictive ringwork by the injury-conscious WWE. Even wrestlers he could defeat with no problem in the past such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a> are now pinning him cleanly and making him look like a chump. True he's won the world title a few more times in later years but it just doesn't feel like it's as big of a deal now as opposed to if he had won them during the height of his career from 1999 to 2001.
</li><li> Doug Basham and The Damaja greatly benefitted from being the favorties of Danny Davis. They had a great look full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellBentForLeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellBentForLeather">leather</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spikesofvillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spikesofvillainy">spikes</a>, as well as plenty of promo time where Doug Basham's talent shown through. Also, many women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">fawned over them</a> and wanted to be their valets. But they didn't just have favoritism going for them; they were legitimatelly talented and Damaja had some of the best cardio in the business. Doug Bashama's charisma wasn't just on the mic or in his mouth but physically throughout his entire body. They thrashed and out wrestled opponents; beating them meant something. Then WWE made them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeamTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeamTwins">Tag Team Twins</a>, erasing their distinct look as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a>. Then came scripted promos, cutting into their charisma. Then they were made into the lapdogs of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix">dominatrix</a>. The Basham Brothers were still a talented tag team, but against any other team with any credibility copious cheating was the only way they could gain an advantage, much less win a match, and they cared more about their mistress than title belts(heels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">cheat to win</a>, and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">petty by nature</a>, but most need to display <em>some</em> redeeming quality to get over. Everyone can't be the pyschophantic cowardly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slimeball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Slimeball">slimeball</a>). Doug Basham tried going back to his old gimmick after the tag team was inevitably broken up but no amount of jobber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squashmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squashmatch">squashes</a> could get fans to take him seriously again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> has a most bizarre example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>. In 2004, he was a street-wise thug (who happened to be a white rapper) who never backed down from a challenge, and fought rich bastard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a> while espousing "battle raps" which mocked anyone in a 15-mile radius. In 2005 and 2006, his overwhelming popularity led the writers to turn him into a Hoganesque superhuman with an inferiority complex who openly admitted he was inferior as a technical wrestler, therefore taking away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">everything that made him popular in the first place</a>. It eventually got to the point where fans would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">cheer his opponent out of spite, no matter how evil that person was</a>. Fortunately, the release of his movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMarine">The Marine</a></em> allowed him to get back his never-say-die attitude, and he appears to be recovering from the setback. Slowly. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> seems to be implying that he really is a marine based on his role in the movie doesn't help matters. In fact, most heels who became anti-heroic faces in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a> generally fall under this trope. More so when you consider said anti-heroes tended to have their most popular traits exaggerated when they become faces (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> wasn't a full-blown redneck until his turn, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> didn't rely as much on his "sing-along" catchphrases). Cena's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a> was largely a very mishandled attempt to appeal to the fans who had turned on him; additionally, it was mostly during his feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">is the head writer's husband</a> and has had many feuds in which his opponent has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">sung his praises</a>. Thankfully, this aspect of his character was dropped after Cena was given a clean victory over Trips.
</li><li> The Sheepherders were vicious, savage brutes who terrorised wrestling promotions all over the world with bloody, violent hardcore matches. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince</a> got ahold of them, he turned them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBushwhackers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBushwhackers">The Bushwhackers</a>, a pair of happy-go-lucky loveable idiots with a trademark silly walk and habit of licking people. However, this was the run which they are best known and fondly remembered for.
</li><li> As a general trend, the WWE's decision to rebrand their TV shows from TV-14 to PG <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">in order to add family appeal</a> has unfortunately resulted in some of this. In order to reach a PG rating, the WWE had to cut back on mature content: scanty clothing, innuendo, weapon use, blood, and especially swearing. Since there are fewer options available for faces and heels to emphasize badass characteristics during a feud, decay is more likely to happen across the board.
</li><li> A peculiar example is Joey Abs of the Mean Street Posse. The Posse (Pete Gas and Rodney) were introduced as childhood friends of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a>, but quickly became utilized as comedy jobbers - they were somewhat smaller than most of their fellow wrestlers and they wore dorky sweater vests and khakis. After a couple months, Joey Abs was introduced as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">heavy</a>. He was pretty big, actually looked intimidating, and for his first couple appearances was treated like a genuine threat in the ring. For some reason the company soured on Abs quickly, and in short order he became portrayed as as hapless as Pete Gas and Rodney. To this day, WWE often references Joey Abs in self-deprecating, "what were we thinking?" spots.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a>, this is very common:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Abyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Abyss">Abyss</a> has gone from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Kane clone</a>, to a hybrid of Kane and Mankind, to a geek who asks if having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline">Jacqueline</a> on his lap makes him not a virgin anymore, back to indestructible badass, and now he's a 6'8" 300+ version of Dave Sullivan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a>, twice. The first was after losing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> at Hard Justice 2007 when Karen Angle predictably turned on Joe. The fans saw that turn two miles away, so they cheered for Kurt and Karen and booed Joe. The real damage didn't come until Joe cut a promo on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Scott Hall</a> at Turning Point, leading to his rebellion against TNA management. Unfortunately, he came off as whiny, leading the fans to boo him even more. He was losing left and right. Eventually, at Lockdown 2008, he got his badass cred back after beating Angle for the TNA Title.
</li><li> Alas, that didn't last long, did it? After losing the title to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> (when Nash turned on him), Joe formed the TNA Front Line along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> to counter Sting's new group: the Main Event Mafia. During that feud, the Front Line lost nearly EVERY SINGLE MATCH against the Mafia, with the exception of Lethal Lockdown. It was also during this feud where Joe became a member of the "Nation of Violence," which saw him torture <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnDaivari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnDaivari">Sheik Abdul Bashir</a> for no reason whatsoever and threaten to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottSteiner">Scott Steiner</a>. Again, the fans looked at Joe as a complete psychopath, and not the badass he once was. Then, he turned on the Front Line and became just another lackey for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayLethal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JayLethal">Jay Lethal</a> had a stretch where he pinned TNA Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> clean, won the X-Division Title, and saved the aforementioned X-Division from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheDudleyBoys">Team 3D</a>. The latter, he did ALL BY HIMSELF. During all of this, he was getting the attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads">So Cal Val</a>. Immediately after he got the girl, saved the X-Division, and got his title back, Sonjay Dutt wooed Val away from him. That was the beginning. Val remained undecided on who to shack up with, until she turned on Lethal, killing him for good.
</li><li> For that matter the X-Division, whose title belt ranged from almost as to just as important as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> World title (a belt which also deserves its own entry) as a division with no limits that anyone could compete in if they could go hard enough, to flippy wrestlers with a weight limit. Basically top of the card to glorified cruiserweights banished from the main event and Impact altogether to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BShow">B show</a> Xplosion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries">Austin Aries</a> brought back some prestige, as he turned it from "not even worth mentioning in the same angle regarding the world title" to "glorified contract for a world title match". Seiya Sanada's run with the belt in the Japanese Wrestle1 Promotion, Samoa Joe getting the belt back and being treated as an equal to the World Champion and title defenses occurring in the main event again greatly improved the X Division's image.
</li><li> Just like Abyss and Kane, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> goes up and down the badass roller coaster frequently. With him playing second fiddle to the retired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, AS THE WORLD CHAMPION, NO LESS, it's safe to say he's on the down slope.
</li><li> While it's rare to see this happen to so many people at once, the Knockouts Division had this happen to them. While they started out as huge ratings draws, being a bunch of badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> who could actually wrestle, which was a rarity on the wrestling scene, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the corporate changes at TNA focused less on their abilities,</a> and used them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> more and more often. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Several incidents happened, ultimately leading up to many Knockouts leaving the company,</a> leading to fewer actual wrestlers in the Division, which became the poor man's WWE Divas. The returns of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a> and new acquisitions such as Havok and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rosemary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rosemary">Rosemary</a> got the Knockouts their own pay per view event, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdChant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdChant">Better than the divas!</a>" chants in New York and back into Impact's main event on occasion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness">Nigel McGuinness</a> was a force to be reckoned with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>, the biggest complaint against him being his first baby face champion run relying <em>too much</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">fighting spirit</a>. Then his stint as Desmond Wolfe in TNA - after a very promising start in which he brutalized Angle - led to one humiliation after the other. This case was particularly harsh, as TNA started burying him after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">the fans voted him as the person they most wanted to see as their World Champion.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> had a rather abominable case of this with BJ Whitmer. He spent 2006 on the cusp of stardom, proving himself as a badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a> who bled for ROH against the invading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW">CZW</a> and stood victorious after a barbed wire match with the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NecroButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NecroButcher">Necro Butcher</a>. But then, after losing to his longtime archenemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a>, Whitmer went on a losing streak that completely nullified the entire year of Badass cred that he had acquired. It didn't help that he came out of the losing streak by aligning with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> Adam Pearce, who nobody bought as a major threat; thus, Whitmer went from an independent and awesome hero to the thug of a weak and cowardly villain.
<ul><li> For that matter, Jimmy Jacobs and his Age of the Fall stable had this kick in very quickly. They debuted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">hanging Jay Briscoe upside down and letting his blood rain on the ring</a>, but were quickly reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Cowards</a> in subsequent confrontations with the Briscoe Brothers. They constantly ping-ponged between pathetic cowards and evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinators</a>, but they completely lost their credibility in many fans' eyes when they began making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemplateOurNavels">Contemplate Our Navels</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> video segments.
</li><li> Of all people, there was a case with Davey Richards. As soon as Rocky Romero joined the No Remorse Corps, Richards became the ass of many jokes between Romero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoderickStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoderickStrong">Roderick Strong</a>. He'd have to leave and get training from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanSevern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanSevern">Dan Severn</a> to regain his credibility.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>'s badass decay ultimately turned him into the poster child for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/ProfessionalWrestling">memes</a> in professional wrestling. There's too many to mention here, so you can see the respective pages.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a>' badass decay started when she lost <em>her</em> WWE Women's Championship to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a> in late August 2006, who would then lose it to a retiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>. Once Trish retired, Mickie was eventually given Trish's character, thus losing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">Loony Fan</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fangirl</a> character in the process.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> lampshaded in his autobiography how his Mankind gimmick went from insane pain-lover to doofy goofball in near-record time. He didn't mind as both interpretations were wildly popular, but he had to admit it ended up a lot different that he envisioned.
</li><li> Almost everyone from The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinistryOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinistryOfDarkness">Ministry of Darkness</a> bar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a>. Dennis Knight went from the deranged Mideon to the comedic Naked Mideon and "Bogus Mankind"; Nelson Frazier Jr. went from Mabel, King of the Ring, to Viscera, servant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>, to Viscera, "The World's Largest Love Machine;" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RonSimmons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RonSimmons">Ron Simmons</a> went from tough world heavyweight champion (in WCW) to leader of the Nation of Domination to tag-team champion with JBL in the Acolytes, to beer-drinking redneck in APA, to some guy that walks around saying "Damn!"
<ul><li> Viscera did come back with the terrifying new image of Big Daddy V. He now let most of his tattoos show and was unstoppable for a little.

</li><li> The Acolytes/APA were actually pretty over as Stone Cold-like tough guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a> and were usually on the fringes of the top feuds at any given time in 1999 and 2000.

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HellInACell">Hell in a Cell</a> match was once <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">Gimmick Match</a> where the most vicious of feuds went to end in a bang. However, around 2006, the Cell was built to be bigger, ensuring nobody was to try the spots on the top of the Cell such as the ones in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">HBK</a> vs Undertaker, Mankind vs Undertaker, or Cactus Jack vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>. The matches nonetheless remained intense and bloody until the <em>Hell in a Cell</em> PPV was created in 2009. This not only meant that the feuds in a Hell in a Cell match usually now lacked the history of intensity of past matches but that the new PG rating meant that all the viciousness of past matches would be gone, essentially just making the match a standard no-DQ match with a big cage obstructing the audience's view. While Hell in a Cell used to be a truly special match used maybe once or twice a year to cap off a really big feud, it's since become just another gimmick match with no real specialness to it.
</li><li> After a promising start, this ended up happening to pretty much every member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DieBruderschaftDesKreuzes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DieBruderschaftDesKreuzes">Die Bruderschaft des Kreuzes</a> except Lince Dorado, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a>, and even then not really as though he earned respect from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chikara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chikara">Chikara</a> fans he still went from a super face to just another guy in a group who was often not included in their biggest matches. This was used most dramatically with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Claudio Castagnoli</a>, who got frustrated and quit the promotion altogether but perhaps most ironically with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaizeeHaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaizeeHaze">Daizee Haze</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SaraDelRey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SaraDelRey">Sara Del Rey</a>, who joined Die Bruderschaft for the purpose of defying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">chickification</a> but ended up being knocked off in rapid succession by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieKingston">Eddie Kingston</a>. Del Rey would regain most of her bad ass aura at the BDK's expense after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> in fact.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> went through this after awhile. After starting off strong, and winning the WWE championship in his first PPV match, he went down the card a little, but was still badass and netted another (albeit short), championship reign. Then came the 2010 <em>King of the Ring</em> tournament; despite winning said tourney, after becoming "King Sheamus" he started losing frequently (although to guys like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a>, but still). Fortunately, he dumped the king regalia <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2weil');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2weil" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2weil');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> at a house show where he was scheduled to face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YoshiTatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YoshiTatsu">Yoshi Tatsu</a>, he attacked him from behind, dropped him with a High Cross, and said "King Sheamus is dead. Long live the Celtic Warrior!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrSoIHeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrSoIHeard">...Or So I Heard</a></span> and has gotten much better. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turning face</a> in the summer of 2011, though, he's becoming even more bad-ass, going on a roll from that point on<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note316ov');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note316ov" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note316ov');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He's looked strong, keeps winning cleanly on a regular basis, and has even won the 2012 Royal Rumble and the championship at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> <em>in 18 seconds</em></span>. <br><br>Sadly, he fell into this again in 2015, which got even worse when he won the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> briefcase. He was basically losing all his feuds, had no storyline direction, and was jobbing to midcard matches in some vein hope that the fans would forget about him to make his cash-in more shocking (instead, all it did was make them actively dread it). This was one of the main arguments the IWC made against Sheamus being champion in the first place, especially in comparison to Reigns, who's been booked like he's the second coming of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>. Sheamus has lost so much credibility that the fans have a hard time taking him as a serious threat to Reigns, while Reigns' character is bland and stale; there's effectively no reason to care about this feud at all.
</li><li> In a slightly tragic real life example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock">Ken Shamrock</a> went through this. The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UltimateFightingChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UltimateFightingChampionship">UFC</a> Superfight (now Heavyweight) champion, Shamrock was once known as "The Worlds Most Dangerous Man", and was signed to the then-WWF, where among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">he was at one point considered as a candidate to win the WWF Championship</a> from the departing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a>, defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> to win the Intercontinental Championship (the decision would be reversed when Shamrock refused to release the Ankle Lock) and won the prestigious King Of The Ring tournament. However, he would go on to sustain a serious neck injury at the hands of a debuting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>, and was never the same. He would try to return to MMA, and while his old self briefly shined through, he just didn't have it any more. To this day he has refused to retire, despite the heavy toll steroids have taken on his body and losing far more matches than he's won (and on one of those occasions where he won, it was overturned afterwards when he tested positive for steroids after the match), and usually ending the fights as a bloody mess, a mere shell of the man he once was.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VelvetSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VelvetSky">Velvet Sky</a> after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> lost all of the ruthlessness and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo">Awesome Ego</a> that made her so entertaining in the first place.

After she returned in late 2012, she became more badass.
</li><li> While many had dismissed WWE's "Championships" already after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatKhali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatKhali">The Great Khali</a>'s reign, 2011 was a particular bad year when <em>The</em> WWE Championship belt changed hands nine times in the span of seven months, also resulting in instant badass decay for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, who each enjoyed zero day reigns during this stretch. It almost halted all the momentum built up by duplicating the ROH Summer Of Punk angle when drama over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> text messages were deemed more important that the title picture. Thankfully, Punk would turn things around for himself and the belt, going on to have the longest reign of the modern era after decisively knocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">Alberto Del Rio</a> and all other distractions away. The reign was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">long enough</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">outlast</a> the reputation flattening of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback">Ryback</a> and give the champion importance again.

In SHINE, she came in with much fanfare but started to be taken a lot less seriously due to losing three times in a row, getting half of her victories through luck as she couldn't even cheat effectively. Her SHIMMER run didn't slow, though, making this overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>. It also helped that after show eleven or so SHINE and SHIMMER were no longer in continuity with each other.
</li><li> Any semblance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> being viewed as a legit badass was destroyed after his fight with Mickey Gall in the UFC, where Punk threw one punch, was taken down, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">and quickly beaten with virtually no resistance.</a> It didn't help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">that the UFC started promoting Punk as their next big thing before even announcing an opponent</a>. After two injuries during training delayed his debut, by the time the long awaited fight actually took place many people had grown sick of CM Punk and where immensely underwhelmed by his less than stellar performance.
</li><li> You'd be hard-pressed to find a more prolonged, wasteful and easily-avoidable case than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a>. When he debuted as the head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily">The Wyatt Family</a>, Bray was <em>terrifying</em> despite not being a physically-imposing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingMonster">Wrestling Monster</a> (although he commanded two in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper">Luke Harper</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ErickRowan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ErickRowan">Erick Rowan</a>)- he was simply the scariest <em>character</em> WWE had created since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> was at his peak. Despite a terrible debut match against Kane, Bray and his family got <em>massively</em> over with the fans, with Bray managing to get cheered against not only divisive characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>, but even crowd favorites like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a>,</em> and the Family's popularity probably peaked during their epic 2014 feud against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>. Unfortunately, what WWE seemed to take away from this was that Bray was so popular that he could be used to put over <em>anyone</em> and it wouldn't negatively affect him, and eventually people started to notice that, for all his threatening talk, Bray <em>loses all the time.</em> He has a lamentable 0-4 record at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> and has lost effectively <em>every</em> feud he's ever had. Even winning the WWE Championship at <em>Elimination Chamber 2017</em> didn't help because this only set up his betrayal by his then-acolyte <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, leading to an utterly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">ridiculous</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> match where he summoned PowerPoint projections of maggots and centipedes onto the ring before losing to an RKO. Subsequent feuds with stars like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt">Finn B&aacute;llor</a> and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt Hardy</a> have done nothing to elevate Bray, with most fans considering them to only be dragging down the other guy. Nobody is <em>interested</em> in the once-terrifying leader of the Wyatt Family any more because everyone knows he's <em>always</em> going to lose, because WWE <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">just won't let him have any credibility!</a>
</li><li> Remember when Finn B&aacute;llor came to the ring in full demon body-paint and was the first ever Universal Champion?

Also, as the product grew darker and harsher via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceRusso">Vince Russo</a>, the Oddities looked, well, even more out of place than they had before.
</li><li> On the January 25, 1999 <em>Raw,</em> the Oddities were in the ring and the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwe-h.html">WWE World Heavyweight Champion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">the Rock</a> came out and threatened all four guys at once. Granted, it's the Rock, but, <em>still</em>, ONLY in pro wrestling would you see a situation where one regular sized guy on his own could threaten four guys whose combined weight was close to 1 1/2 TONS, and the <em>four guys</em> would be the ones at the disadvantage.
</li><li> The Oddities were there for Steele's match against Droz, which Droz won after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">ramming Steele's head into the exposed turnbuckle</a> in 48 seconds. Droz defeated Kurrgan a week later after a broomstick shot to the throat from the outside in 1:53. Giant Silva never faced him in the ring, but he was attacked by Droz and beaten down with a chair.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AhmedJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AhmedJohnson">Ahmed Johnson</a>. So, so much. Before his injury, he was seriously over and looked like he might be the first African-American wrestler to win the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwe-h.html">WWE World Heavyweight Championship<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. He was at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>-like levels of popularity. His frequent injuries, a terrible heel turn, and a reported bad attitude backstage led to WWE releasing him in February 1998, and he never recovered.

<ul><li> This inevitably happens in many card games due to a phenomenon known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>," where R&amp;D overpowers their new cards so much that older sets become laughably weak in comparison. Remember how powerful Base Set Charizard was in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> TCG? Nowhere near the title holder for HP or damage output now.
</li><li> The entire drow race in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> setting. First they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">sexy</a>, intelligent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">heavily matriarchal</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> insane badasses with a small pantheon. Then we got the hero Drizzt (a fugitive from his culture). Due to the Dungeons and Dragons rules discouraging evil players, some players want to be drow because they're cool... but good-aligned and without the severe social stigma, despite drow being nearly always evil and Drizzt being a considerably-developed unique example of a good-aligned drow. Then we got the good aligned deity Eilistraee, and her entire clutch of (mostly) female drow worshippers who, naturally, danced naked at night. (Their chief priestess, Qilue, has a magic dress of invisibility. No, it doesn't make Qilue <em>herself </em> invisible...)
<ul><li> Drizzt himself in the 2nd edition had rules written solely to make him more dangerous, such as, despite being in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoint">Hit Point</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a> based combat system, having a flat chance of killing anyone in a single shot. It was a low chance, but he had a better chance of killing someone with a normal attack than he did of scoring a critical hit. In 3rd edition, he is a less than optimal build with very few special rules. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">may</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">may not</a> be a good thing.
</li><li> Drow are a slightly odd case because they started off as a society of mostly-neutral people oppressed and managed by their massively evil and Machiavellian rulers and priestesses under the aegis of their malevolent goddess Lolth. One of the first sources to deal with them, <em>The Vault of the Drow</em>, described a lot about the Vault and the city therein, and they were a functioning if troubled society. Later sources <em>removed</em> nuance by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">promoting their entire society to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">dark elf badasses</a>, until eventually different interpretations were built up again.
</li></ul></li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> example: the Red Wizards of Thay. They used to be an extremely powerful and influential organization of (mostly) amoral/evil wizards. Now they are band of loosely connected merchant arcanists who make a, admittedly profitable, living trading magical items. This is a justified case: their <em>own leader</em> launched a coup in their homeland of Thay that his lieutenants the zulkirs did not want. When they rebelled against him he unleashed the Spellplague against his own followers. The last of the zulkirs then sacrificed themselves to prevent their treacherous leader's ascension to godhood. Without their leaders, and beset on all sides by their many enemies, the Red Wizards were forced to disband their once powerful organization and focus solely on their front business of magical item trading to survive.
</li><li> The Necrons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> and their C'Tan gods began as a supremely enigmatic group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> with ultimately unknown designs for the galaxy in general and mankind in particular. They had few unit selections and no real characters because the vast majority of their forces simply had not awakened yet, or at least had left no survivors to report their existence, and ended up with a reputation for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pets</a> due to their implication of being ultimately unstoppable, despite two other major factions being just as doomsday-ish. Then, starting with the Fifth Edition, they started getting development and have been subjected to a nonstop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Worf effect</a> by everyone with no end in sight.
<ul><li> This example is based primarily off the author's POV. Since the C'tan are omnipotent star gods and the necron race managed not only to engage and imprison them, it would stand to reason that the race in general has in face averted the worf effect, whilst simultaneously worfing the star gods themselves.
</li><li> By 4th Edition, some parts of the fluff were just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">merciless</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">humiliating</a> for the Eldar. 7th Edition reversed a lot of the damage and made them top tier to boot.
</li><li> The Avatar of Khaine. A physical manifestation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> Eldar god of war. He used to be a nigh-unstoppable close-combat beatstick for the army, yet later fluff has it constantly being beaten and overwhelmed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">make another character look more badass</a>.
</li><li> The God Emperor went through this after the Horus Heresy, rather understandably. Before that whole mess, he was the greatest psyker in the galaxy, a mighty warrior, a genius scientist and ruled over an impossibly vast interstellar empire. You could've called him a God without being accused of hyperbole or exaggeration. However, after he was wounded by Horus and had to go on life support... Well... Here's <a class="urllink" href="http://images.wikia.com/warhammer40k/images/5/50/EmperorsWisdom.jpg">before<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> and <a class="urllink" href="http://images.wikia.com/warhammer40k/images/2/25/Emperor_Upon_Throne.jpg">after<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Nagash</a>, arguably the most terrifying villain in Warhammer Fantasy bar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Chaos Gods</a> is currently suffering from a hard case of this in Age of Sigmar.
<ul><li> This was reversed after a while. While he was something of a joke at the beginning (when the story was focused entirely on the new Stormcast Eternals and their war with Chaos) in the <em>Malign Portents</em> campaign at the end of first edition and the <em>Soul Wars</em> one at the beginning of the second he's been promoted back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Any army with a Codex or Army Book designed in a previous edition will end up undergoing this as time marches on and they become less and less effective, to the point of being unusable, on the tabletop.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, we get the Sabbat. Initially portrayed as something like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostBoys">The Lost Boys</a>, they get watered down slightly in that, indeed, they do have their own rules after all. An odd case, though, goes to the Tzimisce, the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> masters. A poorly-received book posited that their powers were really an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> plague, and this actually made them less awesome somehow. Later books ignored this in general.
</li><li> This trope is inherent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">virtually any campaign that actually gives stats to its gods.</a> Some settings avert this by having enemies above a certain power level being unstatted, but killable if the players come up with a plausible means to do so. Others do their level best to spend five hundred to a thousand words saying "You lose" in attribute and skill form. Justifiable in some settings more than others &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a> have gods dying to mortals be rare, but not unheard of events, but there's no excuse for statting up Cthulhu in D&amp;D.

In every 3D platform game, they're significantly less threatening than they are in the 2D Mario games, even being completely unable to hurt Mario in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">Goombas</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">on the other hand...</a>

In their debut game, they were one of the most fearsome enemies in the game. They could chuck baseballs, footballs, dig up rocks, split themselves into three, leap high and forward, and took up to <em>six</em> hits to defeat. When they finally make their 3D Mario game debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em>, all they can do is, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">charge</a> and only take two hits to defeat.

Many suspect that the popularity of these characters and their expanded roles as a result are chiefly to blame for this.
<ul><li> In the first game his ambition, Riku's independence and pro-activity firmly cast him as an awesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Villain</a> dedicated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">saving Kairi</a> no matter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourBrainOnEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourBrainOnEvil">what the cost</a>. That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">doesn't really work out</a>. Thanks also in due part by the Reverse/Rebirth mode of <em>Chain of Memories</em>, in which he is pressured by an enigmatic and morally ambiguous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">Stealth Mentor</a> into accepting the darkness in his heart which makes him more powerful but much less determined and proactive as a result, his independent spirit is all but absent in the sequel, where for the vast majority of the game he is content to play the role of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak">Black Cloak</a>-wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a> and wait for Sora to do the <em>real</em> hero work.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series sort of accidentally did this in reverse to Rebecca Chambers, by giving her a badass upgrade in the <em>prequel</em>, where she's a player character and therefore pretty competent. Some time between then and running into Chris in the original game, she apparently snapped from the sheer horror around her and lost all her zombie-killing skills. It's played straight in <em>The Stage</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ResidentEvilVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ResidentEvilVendetta">Vendetta</a></em>, where she goes from part of an elite team of cops to a university professor. In <em>The Stage</em>, she is completely unable to shoot her former (now zombified) acquaintances, and is held hostage twice, with the villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> it to boot. In <em>Vendetta</em>, the trailer even spoils she'll be held hostage again in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">I Have You Now, My Pretty</a> way.

Though Leon being a rookie cop and Chris being a trained veteran would seemly qualify Leon for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> inferior status, thanks the sheer coolness of Leon and quality of the games he stared in (<em>Resident Evil 2</em> and the record braking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>) Leon far surpassed Chris who was left looking like a stock extra in G.I Joe in comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> did its best to inject life and coolness back into Chris, having him pull some pretty outrageously badass moves like matching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Wesker</a> in combat and literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">punching boulders apart</a> but despite this display Chris still lacked the quick wit and suaveness that the fans adored about Leon. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em> is his lowest point becoming a violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcoholic</a> after the death of his men who has to be talked back into action by his stock partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideKick">Piers</a>. To be fair to Chris, Leon goes though some emo funk in the same game and even some suicidal inclinations not remotely present before.
<ul><li> Even in the <em>Resident Evil</em> CG movies, Chris draws the short straw only now appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ResidentEvilVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ResidentEvilVendetta">Resident Evil: Vendetta</a></em>, when Leon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">rocked</a> the previous two movies and forces Chris to share the spotlight in <em>Vendetta</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There is a particularly ridiculous and instantaneous example of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</a></em>.

In the sequel, she is put out of commission at the <em>very start</em> of the game, and at the end when she's freed, does <em>nothing</em> to contribute to the final battle.
</li><li> Justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> series: Crunch Bandicoot made his debut as a gruff and cocky villain working under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Doctor Cortex</a>.

</li><li> Cobra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentScope">Silent Scope</a></em> fell hard in just two games. In the first, you had to kill him while chasing him in a moving vehicle, with his hostage just inches away...whereupon he <em>hijacks a trailer</em> and comes after you again. (The only way to avoid this was to take him down in the stadium, which itself is at least the second hardest boss fight in the game.) In the second game, while he's still a tough nut, you only need to kill him once, and he's an absolute coward who hides behind a hostage the entire battle (mitigated...<em>slightly</em>...by the fact that he's fighting two guys at once). In the third game, he's nothing but an afterthought you obliterate in the first mission.
</li><li> A common criticism of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> is that this happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Queen of Blades herself</span> at the ending.

Nowadays he hardly fights and is more than content with just standing on the sidelines while Sonic handles all of the work; tellingly he's easily frightened by some Nightmares in <em>Unleashed</em> when he's done far greater feats in the past. What's more, in <em>Sonic Adventure</em> he's fully capable of defeating the dark god Chaos after it's already absorbed four Chaos Emeralds, but in <em>Sonic Forces</em>, he is utterly terrified of its most basic form.
</li><li> Once considered Sonic's equal and the respected guardian of a powerful artifact, Knuckles the Echidna has now devolved into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> who always gets tricked by an outside party and is the embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">He's hardly even an important character anymore either.</a> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> was getting tired of playing multiple characters and wanted to go back to <em>just</em> Sonic.

However, the highly illiterate, conservative and theocratic society has a tendency to not advance forward like the European powers out west.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic type</a> has slowly been undergoing this over the years. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em>, Psychic-types had high Special stats, allowing them to dish out Special damage as well as take it, were often fast, and had practically no weaknesses.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1j3zo');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1j3zo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1j3zo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Ghost</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Bug</a> were <em>supposed</em> to be their weaknesses, but due to a coding error, Ghost-type moves were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">completely useless on Psychics</a>, and what few Bug moves did damage were very weak. Plus, most Bugs were also weak and part-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson">Poison</a>, making them weak to Psychics.</span> That the strongest Pok&eacute;mon in the game, Mewtwo, was a Psychic also helped. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>, however, not only split Special into two stats (elaborated on down below), but also introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Dark</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary">Steel</a> types, both of which resist Psychic-types (the former being a weakness <em>and</em> being immune to them). The Physical/Special split of moves introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> also cut their effectiveness, making once viable moves now useless on them. Later generations added more and more powerful Ghost-, Dark- and Bug-type moves and Pok&eacute;mon, giving them more threats to be wary of. While a few Psychic-types are still good, it's now mostly <em>in spite of</em> their type and not <em>because</em> of it, and they're nowhere near the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> they were in Gen I.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em> split the Special stat into two stats &mdash; Special Attack and Special Defense. A Pok&eacute;mon's old Special became one stat, while the other was brand new. For some, this cut their usefulness - Gyarados' Special Attack was reduced, Flareon couldn't use special moves to work around its poor physical movepool as effectively anymore, and many special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a> (like the aforementioned Psychic-types) became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>.
</li><li> Around Gen V, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dragon</a> type was initially regarded as the best type in the game thanks to standout Pok&eacute;mon like Hydreigon, Garchomp and Salamence, all boasting great stats and good movepools. The type itself also resisted many common types and had only two weaknesses - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesOneToKillOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesOneToKillOne">itself</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Ice</a>. Gen VI introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">Fairy</a> type, which was immune to Dragon-types while super effective against them. The Dragon-type's usefulness plummeted (especially poor Hydreigon, who ended up with a 4x weakness to it).
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental">Normal-types</a> like Persian, Tauros and Snorlax were very good in the days of <em>Red/Blue</em>, with access to a wide movepool for type coverage, hitting most types for at least neutral damage, all around good stats. As the games went on (with changing game mechanics<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23de5');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note23de5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23de5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">like the Special stat split, the Physical/Special move split, and critical hits no longer being determined by Speed (this particularly hurt Persian bad)</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> setting in with the introduction of more specialized Pok&eacute;mon), most of those former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a> ended up becoming more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> with their movepools reduced in usefulness from before.
</li><li> In <em>Diamond/Pearl</em>, Regigigas is fought at Level 70, making it a challenging battle. In <em>Platinum</em>, for whatever reason, it was lowered to <em>Level 1</em>, making it far less challenging to fight (but harder to capture... unless you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">False Swipe</a>).
</li><li> Bronzong and Metagross were once very good, with only two weaknesses as Steel/Psychic-types (and Bronzong's abilities would cut that down to one, and the opponent wouldn't know which weakness was left). That changed with Gen VI, which removed Steel's resistance to Dark and Ghost. Subsequently, Bronzong and Metagross became easier to take down (and Metagross's Meteor Mash move had its power reduced).
</li><li> Moves change in power, effect and accuracy across generations, potentially undergoing this. For example, in <em>Red/Blue</em>, Blizzard had 120 power and 90% accuracy, and Hyper Beam didn't require a recharge turn if it defeated a Pok&eacute;mon. In later games, Blizzard's accuracy became <em>70%</em> (and Gen VI made its power 110), and Hyper Beam now always requires a recharge turn after use.
</li><li> Mewtwo, while not as extreme as other Pok&eacute;mon, did undergo this for a while. Once the most powerful Pok&eacute;mon, Mewtwo's ability to take special hits was cut by the Special stat split, the introduction of Dark-types, Steel-types, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Blissey</a>, and more Pok&eacute;mon with similar or higher base stat totals made countering Mewtwo easier, and the physical/special split of moves made many once-good special moves become physical (which Mewtwo isn't as good with). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Then Gen V gave Mewtwo a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">that destroys Special Attack walls, and Gen VI gave it</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">two</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Mega Evolutions with the highest base stats of any Pok&eacute;mon</a> (rivalled only by Mega Rayquaza).

</li><li> Joe Swanson has also suffered from this. In the beginning, while the show occasionally made jokes about his disability, he was a competent police officer who could his own in a fight despite being handicapped.

Grim's first appearance in the first episode shows him as a terrifying spirit that collects people when it's their time to die. Starting in his very next appearance, he obeys the every command of Billy and Mandy, and things only get worse from then on. Hoss is more or less a competent badass in his first appearance, but in the TV spin-off <em>Underfist</em>, he lives with his mom in a trailer, is forced to work with several monsters just because Mandy says so, and he also gets beaten up possibly more than any other character in the story. He even admits that he has been wetting his bed for the last thirty years and a marshmallow bunny is the reason he hates monsters so much. A far cry from what he once was.

He blinded Layla, transformed Faragonda into a tree, made Tecna disappear in a black hole - even if all these events were resolved after a few episodes, they showed he was serious menace. At some point, the authors must have realized he was <em>too</em> powerful, and the fairies had to defeat him sooner or later; so, in the last episodes he became an increasingly stupid cardboard villain and, finally, his handsome appearance was revealed to be the disguise of his true form, a big ugly demon.

</li></ul></li><li> Rampage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, who starts out as a psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> who Megatron barely keeps under control, due to being (among other things) unkillable. He is progressively nerfed after this, becoming one of the Predacon troops (if still psychotic) and gets knocked around by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Depth Charge</a>. He even loses his invincibility in the last episode for no apparent reason. That could have something to do with the Energon blades/spikes they were using still being in their raw, unstable state.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, Brock Samson's love interest accuses him of going through this when he displays uncharacteristic interest in taking care of the kids rather than just guarding them. He is, however, still plenty badass.
</li><li> Duncan of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> series started out as a bad boy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> from juvie who was able to intimidate most of the other campers. Come the next two seasons, possibly due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Courtney</span>, he starts to lose the intimidating aspect of him and occasionally gets his ass handed to him by some of the other campers. Two of which happen to Harold and Cody, the two nerdiest characters in the show. Although Duncan does get some of his badassery back late Season 3, when he teams up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Alejandro</a> and starts acting like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>...but he fails at even that in the end.
<ul><li> Season 5 builds an entire subplot around Duncan's badass decay. After being placed on the Heroic Hamsters team, he gradually gets "sucked into their niceness" and becomes a huge sweetheart, to his horror and everyone else's amusement. His desperation to prove that he is still bad leads to him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blowing up Chris' cottage, resulting in his subsequent arrest and removal from the competition</span>. At least his badass nature has been restored.
</li><li> Similar to Duncan, Scott started off as a devious, street-smart badass who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackofEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackofEmpathy">viewed all of the contestants as objects</a> to the point that he seemed like a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopath</a>. A few episodes into season five, his tendency to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> was Flanderized into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">full-blown idiocy</a>, with all of his evil traits totally forgotten. Oddly enough, like Duncan, none of this happened until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he got a crush on</span> Courtney.

</li><li> Plankton from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> went from a menacing threat that always came close to getting the Krabby Patty formula (and actually succeeds in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>) to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> in the later seasons. At least part of this however is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> as a result of amping up the negative qualities of the "heroes", especially his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Mr. Krabs, often conveying them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">Eviler Than Thou</a> (or at least more insufferable) to the point Plankton himself seems placid and down to earth.

They gradually reverted back in Seasons Three and Four, though still had fluctuations.
<ul><li> In the pilot and occasions in Season One, Zordrak was an effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, often plotting schemes competently and sometimes taking control of the situation himself, generally only losing due to his Urpney minions' bumbling and cowardice when left to their own devices. By Season Two he is a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone">Orcus on His Throne</a>, relying on Urpgor for any brainpower and contributing little besides growling at the Urpneys to hurry up and get the stone.
</li></ul></li><li> Megan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a></em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTVSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTVSpecials">first special</a> was a rough cowgirl, with a bulky frame (for a 12-year-old girl, that is) and wasn't afraid of fighting barehanded against monsters or diving downstream to rescue a friend, without mentioning how at the end of the first TV special, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she kills Tirac</span>. Her second TV special turned her into a feminine Bishoujo girl and her Movie/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyAndFriends">TV series</a> final redesign turned her into a boney girl who kept being overpowered by dumb enemies or falling for the dumbest traps and was nowhere as tough or competent as the original Megan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shining Armor went from a Captain of the Royal Guard to getting his butt constantly handed to him by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and making a fool of himself in front of the main cast. It's actually gotten to the point where he cries at least once an appearance in later episodes. Ever since Flurry Heart was born he doesn't even <em>try</em> anymore, having gone from a character who would charge the likes of King Sombra and Lord Tirek despite knowing he was vastly outmatched to submitting and kneeling to Sombra without a fight, cowering in the face of a winterchilla (a giant rabbit) while his sister has to throw up a barrier instead, and outright being told to sit out the final battle against the Legion of Doom.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Princess Celestia</a> also gets increasingly hit by this trope in later seasons. As a millenia-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">ruler of her own nation,</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">universally renowned</a> hero with numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> battle victories under her belt, you would expect her to effortlessly dominate virtually all threats the show's protagonists face. In the show's early run, she almost always had a good reason for why she didn't. Later on, however, she starts getting defeated for increasingly less convincing reasons &mdash; after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">there wouldn't be much of a story if she solved all of their problems effortlessly.</a> This reached its head in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017">the movie</a> where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she seems to just stand there and let herself get turned to stone whereas Cadance and Luna at least make attempts to fight back</span>.
</li><li> The Mane Six also go through this in the movie. While it's excusable for Rarity due to her being a unicorn against anti-magic armor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Applejack</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestThingAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestThingAlive">Rainbow Dash</a> in the beginning forget that they can fight off the bad guys, and even during the big fight all Applejack does is tie a rope around some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Fluttershy</a> also goes through this, despite being previously hinted at having just as much flying potential as Rainbow Dash. The most egregious of it happens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Twilight Sparkle</a> in that she's rarely shown using any of the advanced magical techniques shown throughout the series, instead opting for basic levitation and magic blasts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When she's captured by Tempest Shadow, she doesn't think to teleport or at least turn herself into a small creature like a Breezy to escape, instead opting to blast at the cage she's in despite learning the hard way early on that the enemies' technology is resistant to magic. After Tempest's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a>, the most she does until her friends come to rescue her is sit around moping while her magic is taken, and after that the only thing she does by herself is save Tempest Shadow when the Storm King betrays her. In essence, she's reduced to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> until she remembers she's the Princess of Friendship.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Starscream of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>, so very, very much. In the pilot, he was a genuinely frightening, comparatively cool-headed bastardly second in command unrivaled by any other Starscream to date <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Cliffjumper found out</span>. Later episodes have seen him as a sniveling coward whose fighting style is roughly 90% cheap shots and beating up badly weakened opponents, when he's not getting his ass kicked. Also, he's consistently upstaged and humiliated by Airachnid, and ruined in "Rock Bottom". Though to be fair <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he does pretty well in the second half of "Partners," the episode detailing his desertion. He plays Arcee so she doesn't consider him a threat before beating the scrap out of her. Too bad for him she got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a>.</span> Cementing his downfall, seasons 2 and 3 rather consistently portray him as bumbling comic relief. Although he does get very brief moments to shine, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> calls for it, these happen rarely and he tends to get outdone quickly. In one episode, even his own men call him out briefly on his cowardly attitude.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>:
<ul><li> The seventy-year gap between its predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> and <em>Korra</em>'s present-day has seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">The Order of the White Lotus</a> change from a tight-knit elite group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Masters</a> to a much more diluted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroSecretService">Hero Secret Service</a> charged with protecting Avatar Korra, who spends much of her time chafing under their limits and conspiring ways to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitchTheBodyguards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitchTheBodyguards">Ditch the Bodyguards</a>, often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy">successfully</a>. It <em>is</em>, however, justified in that those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Masters</a> are implied to be dead and that Korra is getting assistance in evading them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figures</a> Katara and Tenzin. Plus, the guys from the original series were the leaders of the White Lotus, while in <em>Korra</em> we mostly see the lower-tier members. This is even acknowledged in Book 3 by the villains.
</li><li> Katara and Toph get hit with a bit of this as well. Both of them were good benders in the original series, but Katara is most known for her healing skills (which she certainly <em>had</em> before, but she could fight back then, too), and Toph does minimal amounts of fighting herself (despite having <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">loved</a></em> it as a teenager). Toph's excuse of being "too old" rang hollow with some fans, since Zuko's still around and active in Korra's time, and there were benders even older than them in <em>Avatar</em>.

Bubbles has gotten her arm easily broken and her eye bruised by things that wouldn't even scratch her in the original continuity. The girls in general also tend to get more overwhelmed than before during fights and even get defeated by stuff they originally could beat more easily.

While he was overconfident, reckless and socially inept, he was far from a complete punching bag.

Formerly the elite of the Ottoman Army and one of the most feared fighting forces in Europe, as the Janissaries grew more powerful politically, their quality went down in inverse proportion as their formerly strict entry requirements were relaxed for family, hangers-on, attendants, and people who didn't do the one thing the janissaries were intended for: fighting, all in order to benefit from the greater prestige that came from the role. This, of course, caused the quality of the janissaries to go down, but any Ottoman sultan who decided that the janissaries needed to go often got overthrown and killed by them, until finally Sultan Mahmud II had enough and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">disbanded them</a> in what was known as the "Auspicious Incident."

We are privy to his tragic backstory revealed in flashbacks as he tries to drive Commissioner Gordon mad by brutally shooting Barbara and then tormenting him with photos of her suffering. Near the end of the story, however, the Joker says that he doesn't clearly or consistently remember the events that made him what he is, naming the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a> in the process. (This story was an inspiration to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">certain filmmakers</a>.)

If the Joker's insanity isn't an unchangeable absolute in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, nothing is certain.

The story starts out with Daredevil reminding Kingpin of his lost wife, who he genuinely loved but who left him because she didn't approve of his criminal lifestyle. Daredevil then takes down his top enforcer Typhoid Mary and things get worse from there. Fisk ends up running afoul of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HYDRA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HYDRA">HYDRA</a>, who blow up all of his business holdings in New York City and drain his financial accounts. Meanwhile, Daredevil has used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>'s database to acquire countless evidence of Kingpin's crimes, and turns them over to a federal prosecutor. Normally Kingpin's a man who'd be able to call in favors, but with the loss of his holdings and his current indictment, nobody wants to risk working with him. To top it all of, Daredevil tricks him into having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> in public, destroying any doubt of his true character and making it clear that nothing is going to save him from his problems. Kingpin has his bail paid by an old lackey of his, and at first he's grateful. Then he finds out that the only reason he got him out of jail was so the Kingpin could be HIS lickspittle for awhile, and tells him to go pick up his laundry. A pretty sad end for a man who once owned New York City and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaredevilBornAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaredevilBornAgain">tore Daredevil's life apart</a>, huh? Except...that last insult was one too many. Kingpin smashes his cane into the guy's skull so hard the head breaks off. He then impales him with the broken end and lifts him into the air. As his blood runs down the Kingpin's arms, he thanks him, saying that he reminded him of a part of him that he had thought lost forever, remarking that he now feels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">...Born again.</a> He walks off with the intent to reclaim everything he had, and Daredevil feels guilty at how far he went to take him down. It could be argued that this storyline is a deconstruction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> and Badass Decay: the Kingpin's efforts to become a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> by creating a legal media empire so he can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> are the reason HYDRA could blow all his business holdings in New York.

<ul><li> In particular, the novel series is virtually the only 40k media that <em>convincingly</em> continues to portray Necrons as horrific monstrosities to be feared. Cain has only pulled off one win out of three encounters with the Necrons (and then only by blowing up a promethium refinery from orbit, turning it into a <em>gigaton-range fuel-air bomb</em>), as opposed to his constant success against just about everything else. They are also the one threat thus far that he has adamantly refused to stand and confront, reputation be damned.
</li><li> The Orks are a mixed case. While they are more often than not the "Original Antagonists" that Cain is sent in to fight only to later stumble upon the real threat (Necrons or Tyranids, depending on the book), the Valhallan regiments with whom Cain serves most of his career are considered experts at fighting Orks in particular, and out-of-universe the Orks <em>are</em> considered the comic relief army. They get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> in <em>Death or Glory</em>, however, and in the beginning of that book Cain mentions that Orks are considered a bit of a joke in-universe, but that the veterans are taking the threat very seriously indeed.

Throughout the show, however, he reveals a vulnerable side, all manner of inner demons, and develops into something of an anti-hero as he works to build the community, fight the destructive influence of George Hearst, and occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>. However, every once in a while a scene pops up to remind the audience what a brutal bastard he is.

Especially Benjamin Linus, whose tragic childhood was sort of balanced out by him committing mass murder because of it.
<ul><li> It plays with the concept with Locke. When we first see him, he's got an awesome Obi-Wan sage thing going on, throwing knives at boars and such. In episode three, we discover he was a rather pathetic and needy guy before the crash, and that he was in a wheelchair before the crash. Episodes starring him only went further as the audience discovers exactly how pathetic and needy he is and why he's that pathetic, as his apparent destiny as someone 'special' is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> more and more.

Orton was, at one point, the spitting image of this trope. Shortly after his departure from Evolution, Orton was placed in a romantic plot in which he played a significantly softer, baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick">gimmick</a>. Fortunately, he got better. When he made another face turn in 2010, he didn't lose any of his ruthlessness.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
<ul><li> Author Rich Burlew specifically mentions this as a problem he faced when writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOrderOfTheStickStartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOrderOfTheStickStartOfDarkness">The Order of the Stick: Start of Darkness</a></em> prequel. Here's the full quote:
<div class="indent">"Writing a story centered around your main antagonist is sort of difficult, because you risk "devillainifying" them. Yes, I just made that word up. What I mean though, is that once an audience has read all about a character's life, with all of their personal struggles and trials and tribulations and such, it's more difficult to see the character as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. My challenge here was to tell the story of Xykon's life without making Xykon even slightly sympathetic. I mean, he's wholly and unapologetically Evil, but more to the point, he's kind of a dick."
</div></li><li> Rich has a similar discussion about Belkar in the foreword for <em>On the Origin of PCs</em>, and states this is one of the reasons why Belkar's backstory picks up just a few hours before the party forms. Although in this case it's more about that giving Belkar a sad backstory would make him rather a sad figure than being a comical one.
</li><li> Belkar has completely turned this trope on its head by learning that he can garner sympathy and influence by <em>pretending</em> to have a case of Badass Decay, after a vivid fever-dream debate with the only character in the series he's ever given much respect. Pretending to turn over a new (Bitter)leaf, Belkar has risked his life to save Haley Starshine &mdash; even though she abandoned him when he was in a similar situation &mdash; but only so that he could mock her about it afterward. He also <em>selflessly</em> refused to kill Haley's treacherous former friend, and convinced his companion to do it instead.
</li><li> Occurred in-story with Vaarsuvius, who finally got the long-desired ultimate arcane power... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the cost of alienating V's spouse, frightening V's children, getting partially damned, AND being utterly ineffectual. Nothing V did after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Taking a Level in Badass</a> changed a thing, other than indirectly freeing O-Chul and giving V's familiar a look at the world of the Snarl</span>... and giving V some overdue humility. Just to drive the point home, despite absolute superiority in terms of raw power in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the battle against Xykon, V still loses because Xykon uses his powers with more cleverness. Conversely, by using V's pre-existing powers (namely, V's familiar and the <em>explosive runes</em> spell), O-Chul and V manage to deal a significant blow to Xykon before escaping by dropping Xykon's phylactery into the sewers</span>.
