In one episode, the characters are all excited because of a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">computer game</a> that will be released very soon. A computer game &#151; on CD-ROM!
</p><p>And Timmy says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAreRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAreRecords">CD-ROMs?</a>"
</p><p>You see, Technology has marched on, and things like CD-ROMs and VHS cassette tapes and so on have relatively recently become either so little-used as to be obscure, or obsolete altogether. This isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a>, which is about futuristic tech becoming old rather than about modern tech becoming old. The important qualifications of this trope are as follows:
</p><ul><li> Show takes place in modern or modern-ish times, usually the not-so-distant past.
</li><li> Show makes reference to something, usually a form of technology, that is "The next big thing" or "state of the art", and indeed it was &mdash; at the time the show was made.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Said technology has since proved to be impractical, has become obsolete, is at least gradually on its way out, or it is just not in the spotlight anymore.
</li><li> Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> for those who remember when said tech was either very common or hyped as the next big thing.
</li></ul><p>As far as that last point is concerned, remember that there have been spectacular technological leaps in just the past twenty years &mdash; within the lifetimes of many (read: most) Tropers, in fact! <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lby6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0lby6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lby6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And if you haven't experienced it yet, don't worry. The first time will hit you completely by surprise sometime within the next five years.</span> For the most part, once a technology is invented, it tends to develop at warp speed. Remember, it took only about 65 years (1903-1969) to go from one rickety plane barely able to get off the ground to putting a man on the MOON! So this can lead to some odd moments for those who grew up watching certain things go from "absolutely essential" to "taking up space in your basement".
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>To clarify, an excellent example would be a scene in a 1995 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> where Chandler gleefully describes all the awesome features of the brand-new laptop that he has received from his company. Then, it really was pretty impressive, the joke being that he'd just be using it to play computer games and type out lists. But <em>now...</em>
</p><dl><dd><div class="indent">"Twelve megabytes of RAM, five hundred megabyte hard drive, with built-in spreadsheet capabilities <em>and</em> a modem that transmits at over 28,000 bps!" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11y8s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11y8s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11y8s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Episode "The One With The List", first airdate November 16, 1995. At that airdate, those features were quite impressive, especially for a laptop.</span>
</div></dd></dl><p>There was a time when these specifications would be mockingly contrasted with a then modern counterpart. However, technology has moved on so far and so fast that Chandler's computer is now unimaginably primitive; within twenty years of the episode's first airdate, even a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnerPhones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnerPhones">low-end</a></em> smartphone was multiple <em>orders of magnitude</em> more powerful than that in every way, while fitting in the user's pocket and costing considerably less than he would have spent. Because of this, most writers nowadays don't get too specific about computer performance, to avoid sounding dated before... well, before next week, frankly.
</p><p>Somewhat related are those moments during not-so-old films where you realize the entire plot could be resolved with something the world takes for granted today &#151; cell phones, for instance. A perfect example of this would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone</a></em> &mdash; the film was originally released on November 16, 1990, however within twenty years, the entire movie likely would have lasted about half an hour at <em>most</em> once you realize that a power outage likely wouldn't have caused a cell phone's alarm clock to reset like the plug-in alarm clock was, cell service wouldn't have been disrupted in the same way the landlines were and in post-9/11 America, the family would have had plenty of time to realize that Kevin was missing due to the <em>very</em> lengthy amount of time it takes to travel through American airports due to security screenings, baggage checks, and so on.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note281wi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note281wi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note281wi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And "lengthy" is not an exaggeration in this instance &#151; it's often recommended that passengers arrive to the airport <em>three hours</em> before the flight even takes off for international flights, and all passengers should be at the boarding gate at least thirty minutes before departure. Since the family only had forty-five minutes to get from their house to the airport before the plane took off, they would have effectively missed the flight.</span> And even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhonesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhonesAreUseless">Cell Phones Are Useless</a>, if Kevin had one, unless it was broken, had a dead battery with no way to charge it or had no service<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ei8b');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3ei8b" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ei8b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the latter two being improbable due to being in a house only briefly without power in a suburban neighbourhood that would likely get decent cell coverage</span>, then someone could easily get in touch with him directly or through someone else in the area at the touch of a button on their cell phone via a messaging app, social media or email (among other easy methods) using one of the ubiquitous free airport wifi hotspots as opposed to having to go through the hassle of finding and gaining access to one of the limited number of coin-operated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayPhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayPhone">Pay Phones</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ds3h');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4ds3h" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ds3h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> which being in France meant needing sufficient change of the appropriate currency</span> in order to place an international call to Chicago PD to send an officer to the house to check on him.
</p><p>A related and increasingly common source of humor shows down-on-their-luck characters as only able to afford the kind of older technology found in thrift stores today.

</li></ul><hr><p></p><h2>Agriculture</h2>
A lot of the old science fiction features a world with food shortage and rationing due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverpopulationCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverpopulationCrisis">extreme overpopulation</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureFoodIsArtificial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureFoodIsArtificial">90% of the food is yeast or synthetic</a>. The reasoning behind this is an assumption that while population will increase at an exponential rate, food production will only increase linearly, therefore there would be a point where population surpasses food production. This theory is known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism">Malthusianism<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<p>Except that... the figures stated have been surpassed or near so, and there is significant overproduction. This is largely thanks to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green Revolution<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which, in addition to mechanization of planting and harvest, also included breeding a lot of high-yield and drought- or pest-resistant crops. (Not all "technology" is machine-based.)
</p><p>Related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense of Scale</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a> when it comes to population growth; many of these examples have populations in the low billions and treat it as catastrophic overpopulation, not merely in terms of agriculture but in terms of population density. For comparison to many of the numbers below, Earth's population is 7.6 billion and climbing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50y8q');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note50y8q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50y8q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though the rate of climbing is slowing</span> as of this writing.
</p><p>It should be noted that many of the agricultural technologies of the Green Revolution depend on agrochemicals whose precursor chemicals are usually derived from crude oil, which isn't getting any cheaper or easier to extract in the long run, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPeakOil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPeakOil">Post-Peak Oil</a> settings do not fall under this trope. Whether this stays true depends how well various proposals for turning various waste products (ranging from plastic to sewage) back into crude oil pan out.
</p><p>Another thing to note is that even today there's still debate on whether we've hit overpopulation. As noted above those who say yes point to dwindling natural resources and say that we can't sustain this level of food production forever, while those who say no indicate that mathematically there is still enough land to grow food for all 7+ billion people today <em>and</em> give each of them a few acres to live, and the issue lies more in logistics. (Those who say yes will retort that one can't just dismiss the whole thing because a model that assumes everything is run perfectly optimally says so, and need to take into account real-world factors.)
</p><p>Can be justified by the world's agricultural breadbaskets having been contaminated by drought, pollution, radiation or disease, leaving too little viable land to farm even hyper-productive crops <em>on</em>.

Trantor needs twenty agricultural worlds to feed its forty billion people. Today, over half the population of Earth is urban, meaning the agriculture of a single planet should have little problem feeding four billion people who produce no food. If you take into account that later sources claim Trantor has significant artificial food production on its own...
<ul><li> A related problem is that Trantor is stated to be a single, planet-covering city hundreds or thousands of levels deep, and there are special observation towers that you have to use if you want to see the sky. There's absolutely no way that you need that kind of urban structure to house a mere 40 billion people when we have 7 billion on Earth with cities covering only a few per cent of the land surface and most of that you can't travel around in much without going outside. (Yes, there are places where you can travel around significant sections of cities entirely indoors, but you have to do it intentionally and it's both limiting and inconvenient in most places where it's possible at all.) Also, if the entire planet is underground, what exactly is stopping the Trantorians from putting the dirt back on the unused surface and growing their own food?
</li><li> Compounding the problem yet again is that Asimov was self-admittedly bad at scale and bad at remembering how many people were supposed to live on Trantor, causing its population to vary from 40 billions to 4 trillions, depending on the book.

Most of the 25 billion people who live on Earth live in clusters of 3,000-meter-tall (almost 2 miles) "urban monads" that house almost a million people each. The rest live in the small farming communities that grow the food on the large expanses of land left over. This, as well as the minimal possessions everyone has, has allowed them all to not only survive but prosper and grow, since they value life and thus have large families starting in their early teens. Several times in the book, in fact, this aversion is lampshaded when characters laughingly reference the past and its fears of a starving, overpopulated world with a much smaller population.

<ul><li> It's not uncommon these days to find audio amplifiers with vacuum tubes. The reason being is that audiophiles say it gives audio some kind of "warmth" to it. It's probably the same thing as an incandescent bulb does for light versus a fluorescent tube.
<ul><li> Apparently vacuum tubes also react to different harmonics from transistors, and overdriving a guitar on a tube amp sounds infinitely better than overdriving a transistor amp.
</li><li> The difference is in the kind of distortion that gets generated when the amplifier stage is driven hard enough (or overdriven) that the amplified signal would exceed the actual supply voltage (which, of course, can't happen). Because of the way tubes work, their output can never actually reach 100% of the input-supply voltage; instead, as you approach the limit, a tube's output "rounds off" in an asymptotic curve (look it up) known as soft-clipping. A transistor, on the other hand, will go all the way to the limit and then simply "hard-clips" any part of the signal that would drive it any higher. Both are, technically, distortions of the e signal, but a tube's soft-clipping produces "low-order harmonics" which are more pleasing to the human ear than the "high-order" harmonics produced by a transistor's hard-clipping. (Transistor circuits <em>can</em> be designed to simulate a tube's natural behavior, but it vastly increases the complexity of the amplifier, and is a lot more difficult to pull off convincingly than you'd think.)
</li><li> Tubes also amplify in a fundamentally different way from transistors. Tubes default to manipulating the current, while transistors default to manipulating the voltage. They both manipulate both, but the default is the primary way the output is manipulated for typical amplifier circuits. This means that tube and transistor amps sound different regardless of what you're doing with them, even if you aren't overdriving them.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few people prefer incandescent type bulbs versus fluorescent and LED lights.
<ul><li> The first is that the warm light an incandescent bulb gives off is very pleasing. This is due to the CRI (Color Rendering Index) of incandescents being closer to that of sunlight than any fluorescents and cheaper run-of-the-mill LED light sources. Though, if you're not used to it anymore, incandescent's yellowishness seems wan.
<ul><li> This is one area in which technology is unlikely to march on due to the laws of physics. An incandescent bulb works by heating up a filament to produce black body radiation. This produces a continuous spectrum with a frequency peak that depends on the temperature but that extends across a large range of higher and lower frequencies. A bulb filament is a bit cooler than the Sun (although not as much as you might think), but will always produce a similar shape spectrum. Fluorescent and LED bulbs instead work by producing light in very narrow bands by exciting electrons in atoms, which emit discrete frequencies when they decay. While newer version attempt to appear similar to incandescent bulbs on casual inspection, it's physically impossible for them to ever reproduce a continuous spectrum.
</li></ul></li><li> The second is that fluorescent and some older LED bulbs flicker: fluorescent tubes glow very briefly and need a constant hammering of electrons to stay "constant", while older LED type bulbs are driven by pulse width modulation (PWM), where the LED shifts rapidly between on and off, the proportions of which give off a certain level of light. For some more sensitive people, this causes headaches, and it can be very irritating to many people on the autism spectrum, who can see the flicker and hear the constant humming. The flickering of fluorescent and LED bulbs is dangerous for machines that reciprocate or rotate. If the machine is going at the correct frequency, it may appear to be going slower than it really is, or in the opposite direction, a phenomenon called the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_wheel_effect">Wagon-Wheel Effect<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This problem is made worse by the fact that some electric motor designs want to spin at a speed directly related to the AC power line frequency (which is what LED and fluorescent lights normally flicker at). While all three can also be made to not flicker at the line frequency, it takes extra components (and extra cost) so it's not normally done unless there's a reason.
</li><li> However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Tech Marches On</a> once again: newer LEDs are current-controlled and as such flicker-free save for minimal amounts of noise, PWM technology has been improved to the point where the pulses vary at tens of thousands of hertz, far above the most sensitive human's perception. CRI has also been taken into account, and LED's can come in colors varying from a milder version of fluorescent lighting (cool white) all the way to a 60w incandescent bulb's (warm white).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> machines <em>can</em> be modded to accept LEDs instead of the incandescent lights they were designed for, but the ones made prior to 2006 were programmed to coordinate the lights with incandescents in mind. A few of them, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FunHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FunHouse">Fun House</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RipleysBelieveItOrNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RipleysBelieveItOrNot">Ripley's Believe It or Not!</a></em>, will cause the LEDs to <em>strobe constantly</em> instead of blinking on and off, blinding the player. Hence, even in the days where LEDs are largely replacing incandescent lights in everything from street lighting to filmmaking, some pinball machines from the '90s and earlier still undergo maintenance using incandescent bulbs. With the United States phasing out sales of incandescent bulbs in 2020, however, this will soon become averted, as pinball fans who do programming are hard at work reprogramming these machines so the LEDs function in the same way their incandescent counterparts do.
</li></ul></li><li> The Soviet Union <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mig-25">MiG-25<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was built with vacuum tubes for a substantial amount of its electronics, mostly because it was more robust to the environment and could withstand an EMP blast better than transistors.
<ul><li> Vacuum tubes are also much easier to manufacture than the types of transistors that are more reliable than vacuum tubes. The early (and most easily manufactured) types of transistors are actually <em>less</em> reliable than vacuum tubes under normal operating conditions, and are particularly prone to failure due to vibration (which is almost impossible to avoid in an aircraft, especially a relatively small one that travels extremely fast).
</li><li> Never mind vacuum tubes: British Naval officers still learn to use slide rules and Morse signals, on the assumption that none of the fancy electronics can be relied on in a pinch.
<ul><li> They are, as far as it goes, correct. They also still teach celestial navigation in at least some navies for the same reason. Very simply, all your electronics <em>can</em> fail, for many reasons. If you can't use your sextant and slide rule, you're probably already dead anyway.
</li><li> For the same reason, soldiers on the ground are taught to use a paper map and a magnetic compass, and artillery crews learn how to calculate their shots manually.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>: There are many apps for modern smartphones which turn the magnetometer inside into a magnetic compass. Reason: Data transmission needed for maps may fail or simply you're too far away from a cellphone tower, GPS signal may be too weak, but the Earth's magnetic field is still there.
</li><li> The same goes with leisure boating, especially blue-water voyaging. Electronics not only <em>can</em> fail; rather, they <em>will</em> sooner or later fail, especially when least desired, and knowledge on how to use sextant and slide rule has saved many long distance sailors. This is especially crucial in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrewOfOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrewOfOne">single-handed sailing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> It is the case that old-fashioned clocks, with hands moving around a numbered face, are sold in stores in a way that capitalises on a quirk in human psychology. If the hands are set approximately to ten and two, they evoke a happy smiling face and it has been demonstrated that people are more likely to buy clocks if they see, at least subliminally, a smiling face. This is known in marketing as the "ten-o-eight" phenomena. Observational comedian Dave Gorman wondered if this is still the case today when so many clocks and watches are digital. What he discovered was that in sales photos and displays, clocks/watches with a digital face are 95% of the time set to... 10:08. <em>in numbers</em>.

Who else here has ever talked about "taping" a show on to a hard disc, or "rewinding" a DVD? Some media applications call it "seeking" or "skipping", but those are even older terms, even if they're not tied to specific medium. It's also still a trend to call any solid-state storage media a "tape", after audio cassette-tapes and video-tape formats like VHS.

<ul><li> Shooting films on, uh, film, pretty much died off. By the early 2010s digital video cameras had improved to the point that the average viewer couldn't tell the difference between the two formats. Shooting to digital video is far cheaper than buying film stock, as well as eliminating the need to develop and scan the film.
<ul><li> Distribution has moved entirely digital as well, as hard drives cost far less than printing thousands of reels of film. Theaters had to upgrade to digital projectors or close due to movies no longer being distributed on film reels.
</li><li> Compared to editing actual film on a flatbed, editing digital video files in an editing program is far faster, and most modern programs can run on off-the-shelf PCs. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneGirl">Gone Girl</a></em> was edited on off-the-shelf Macs using Adobe Premiere.
</li><li> There <em>are</em> filmmakers who insist on using film, declaring that it is demonstrably better than digital. However, there are a number of objective considerations (cost, ease of use, time, etc) that work against it, <em>and</em> multiple sources have shown time and time again that digital recording is just as good if not better than film. That being said, there are a few idiosyncracies involved with film (essentially <em>defects</em> in the film process) that are more difficult to reproduce on digital, as digital recording tries to compensate for these defects to deliver a more accurate image: the most common is light bloom, seen in backlit scenes. Film allows the light bloom to "wash out" around the edges, which is an effect of overexposure but looks "warmer" or "welcoming", whereas digital recording will compensate to show the edges clearly. There are workarounds, but these in effect end up delivering a <em>less accurate</em> picture in order to preserve a method of filming that is inherently inaccurate to begin with.

Also, as the film was made in 1977, there is nothing akin to the Internet in universe (the prequels would eventually add the Holonet as an equivalent) where the Rebels could just keep uploading the plans so people could keep downloading them even if the Empire succeeded in shutting down some of the download sites. There's also an unintentionally hilarious bit where Admiral Motti refers to the "stolen data <strong>tapes</strong>", suggesting the galaxy (which seems to be several centuries ahead of ours technology wise) still uses something akin to video/cassette tapes.

<ul><li> For people that work in facilities that deal with confidential information there is actually a battle to get CD players. Since facilities trying to protect confidential information may not allow phones or MP3 players, for fear of someone saving information on them and walking out the door with it, but generally will allow older CD and tape players. The problem is some areas no longer stock CD players, so if you want to be able to listen to music at your office you're going to have to find an old player that still works. If your office is large you may be fighting hundreds of other people who are also stalking the local thrift stores for this outdated technology. Still, it's a pretty niche need.

Quick and dirty retrofits are also common (they can be performed in less than a day) that replace the floppy drive with a USB port or an SD card reader, which the machine still internally "sees" as a floppy.

<ul><li> Numerous shows and comedians use to make a joke that "in the future there will be hundreds of channels, and nothing to watch". Congratulations, it's officially the future.
<ul><li> In fact, it's likely that the future referenced here is now <em>the past</em>, given the rapidly-declining viewership of cable in favor of streaming for precisely this reason. Unfortunately, streaming is not immune to the same problem.
</li></ul></li><li> A TV without signal, even on most modern media, is shown with TV static. This has largely fallen out of favor due to the shift to digital TV, where one without signal is usually just given a "no signal" message (although it can still be seen if you try to get over-the-air analog stations). Even many analog TVs since the late '80s have the ability to mute static and blank the screen if there's no signal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">Of course this can be partly justified, as it's much easier for the audience to notice an entire screen being covered in static, and they're of course conditioned to know that it's broken if that's what they see</a>.
<ul><li> There have been a few shows set in the far future which feature static-y TVs for added color (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>,</em> for example). However, since digital television is replacing all forms of analog TV, the only way you could have old-style static or bad reception on future TVs is if you intentionally put it in. Bad reception does happen on digital TV, but differently; instead of static, you get horizontal strips of garbled blocks like a badly scratched DVD. (This is known as "tiling.")
</li><li> Unless the video was a recording that had at some point in the past suffered decay in analog transmission or storage &mdash; converting a static-y analog recording to digital is going to perfectly preserve the static. That's no excuse for live transmissions, though.
</li><li> In the days of analog TV, if another appliance in the house was running at the same time as the television (typically something like a vacuum cleaner or a blender), that would cause the TV to get static-y. Nowadays, while vacuuming or making a smoothie while your family member/roommate watches TV might be annoying for <em>other</em> reasons, it's not going to cause the picture on the TV go static-y or "tile."
</li></ul></li><li> Recently, many thrift and second-hand stores have stopped accepting cathode ray tube televisions &mdash; and in some cases, video cassette recorders &mdash; because of their outdated technology and lack of interest by the public. Most of the old CRT TVs and VCRs sit on the shelves for months, unsold, before the stores wind up taking the items to an electronics recycling center (often at a financial loss to the thrift store), and signs at the stores often direct people wishing to make such donations to go to the nearest electronics recycling center. (Although most stores do still accept VHS videotapes, much like it's relatively easy to find eight-track tapes at thrift stores.)
<ul><li> In countries where analogue transmission has been turned off in favour of digital (a large chunk of Asia, Europe, North America, and Australasia), CRT televisions are outright worthless without a set-top box, which has added to second-hand and thrift stores turning them away.
</li><li> That being said, if you <em>do</em> still happen to have one hanging around your house and it still works, it <em>is</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.lifewire.com/analog-tv-dtv-transition-1845700">still possible to use it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. You just have to be aware of its limitations, and you <em>probably</em> won't want it as your main TV in your living room (maybe in a bedroom or something). CRT televisions have in fact taken on a second life among the retro gaming community for a number of reasons, all based around the fact that, prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSeventhGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSeventhGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames">the mid-to-late 2000's</a>, console video games were designed with these older monitors in mind thanks to flatscreen TVs being either rare &amp; expensive or outright nonexistent depending on the game's age. Among other features, CRTs have faster refresh rates that allow for considerably smaller input lag, can properly process the 240p signals that the vast majority of retro games were built around<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note781wc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note781wc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note781wc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">480i didn't become standard for console video games until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames">the sixth generation</a> and was only mildly experimented with during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The16bitEraOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The16bitEraOfConsoleVideoGames">fourth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFifthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFifthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames">fifth</a>; 240p meanwhile was mainly used to provide a clean and even display for the low resolutions of graphically limited game consoles by messing about with a 480i signal in ways that cause most LCDs in the absence of an external upscaler to either misinterpret 240p as 480i and try to deinterlace it (to noticeably detrimental results) or just reject it outright</span>, and tend to handle lower-quality analog video signals much more cleanly, the latter of which was key in making a number of visual effects work with limited graphical capabilities (most notably with the use of dithering to fake gradient shading and translucency over muddy RF and composite signals).
</li></ul></li><li> The trope page for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansPorn">Poor Man's Porn</a> has a whole section (Type C) dedicated to people trying to watch scrambled porn on TV. This is now outdated (except in '80s-'90s period pieces), as newer television sets recognized the scrambled signal and replaced it with a blue screen, and nowadays you simply get a screen saying you do not get that particular adult video channel.
<ul><li> For that matter, the very concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansPorn">Poor Man's Porn</a> is mostly obsolete. Actual porn is freely available, in huge quantities, over the Internet: everything from vanilla sex to fetish porn serving every kink you can imagine (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">few you probably haven't</a>). Admittedly, you're probably not going to be viewing porn at the local library, so you do need your own computer and Internet service. Still, the most common users of Poor Man's Porn weren't the poor, but children who weren't allowed to view anything else. Nowadays, like it or not, any kid who has hit puberty has probably looked up or stumbled upon some illicit porn at some point.

That being said, a <em>new</em> problem has emerged: Streaming services can only afford to have so many shows available, and some will inevitably get removed from the service due to a variety of reasons (disputes, lack of viewership, controversy, and so on). As some shows are available only through streaming, once these shows are removed from the service, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">their availability will drop drastically</a>. The decline of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppointmentTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppointmentTelevision">Appointment Television</a> has also made many feel that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ratings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ratings">the Nielsen ratings</a> have become obsolete, since those only measure viewership of live broadcasts and Nielsen has resisted counting streaming in their ratings since those do not feature the same advertising as on broadcast television and they are stuck using measurement standards that were last updated in <em>2006</em>.
</li><li> Another thing people tend to forget these days is that before the year 2000, basic cable was both more prevalent (to the extent that roughly half of the households that even <em>had</em> cable in a given neighborhood only had the basic package) and didn't include major networks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork">USA Network</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SyFy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SyFy">the Sci-Fi Channel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> (which was a big part of why, to name a random but reasonably well-known example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MondayNightWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MondayNightWars">maintained its ratings stranglehold over</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">WWF Monday Night Raw</a></em> for nearly two years, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT">TNT</a> <em>was</em> on basic cable).
</li><li> Before the days of digital cable and satellite, in order to know what was on television, one either had to wait for information on a particular channel to roll by on a repeating scroll (such as the Prevue channel, which became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TVGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/TVGuide">TV Guide</a> Channel at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>), or use the listings in the local newspaper or the print-copy of TV Guide. As digital cable became more and more prevalent, cable and satellite providers began adding interactive guides, which let consumers look at listings themselves, often much further out than the old rolling scrolls did. This digitalization is also what made it possible for high-speed Internet to come to more and more homes.
</li><li> Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, satellite dishes were large, clumsy things. (They were, and in places where <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8a44m');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8a44m" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8a44m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(regardless of whether or not they're still <em>used</em> as anything other than a convenient place to mount a <em>new</em> satellite dish)</span> they're still around, still are referred to as "BUDs," an acronym meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Big Ugly Dish</a>.) Now, the dish part of it can be barely larger than a dinner plate, thanks to digital TV making things much more efficient than the old analog dishes.
</li><li> Back in the days of CRT sets, alot of people would brag about having one in the 25 to 32-inch range, which can nowadays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Franks2000InchTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Franks2000InchTV">seem laughably small</a>.
<ul><li> It's not just that. Most of the modern visual content, including the TV shows and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a>, is produced for a significantly larger viewing angle than 30 years ago, because it is intended to be viewed either on a 40-50" TV screen a couple meters from the couch, or on a 25-27" computer monitor on the arm length from the user's eyes. Back then, the screen sizes were at least two times smaller, and widescreen CRT TVs are virtually unheard of, so if one attempts to, for example, connect a modern console to an oldschool TV, this would simply look <em>wrong</em> &#151; everything will be way too small, and vice versa.
</li></ul></li><li> Getting information from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PEGChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PEGChannel">PEG Channel</a>. Previously, if you wanted information on the goings-on in your community, or were attending a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorrespondenceCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorrespondenceCourse">Correspondence Course</a>, you would watch these channels. Nowadays, all that information and that classwork are all online. As for people who want to make and share videos about...well, just about <em>anything</em>, they can do so through video-sharing websites such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> or Vimeo. (Without needing to take any classes on how to produce television.) However, PEG channels offer an advantage over these video-sharing sites: when you record at their studio, or using their camcorders, you are using actual TV recording/editing/etc. equipment. (Which is something your average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTuber</a> might not have access to.) And they <em>can</em> be a good place to start if you're hoping to get into TV production as a career.

<ul><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> as Marty is in 1955:
<ul><li> First, when Marty dines with his future maternal family, Lorraine asks whether his family owns a television set, to which Marty says, "Yeah, you know we have two of 'em...", making her younger brother say "Wow, you must be rich!", to which their mother says, "Oh, honey, he's just teasing you. Nobody owns two television sets!"
</li><li> Later, Marty tries to explain his knowledge of an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a></em> as having seen it as a rerun. In several non-English dubs of the movie, the word 'rerun' doesn't exist (usually because the country concerned had not adopted the policy of re-airing episodes of television shows as of the mid-eighties), so Marty says instead that he saw "The Man from Space" episode of <em>The Honeymooners</em> "on tape".
</li><li> As the 1955 Doc looks at Marty's camcorder, he says "Now this is truly amazing: a portable television studio. No wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">your president is an actor</a>, he's got to look good on television!"
</li></ul></li><li> A notable example of the ubiquity of curved CRT screens in the future is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTenTheYearWeMakeContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandTenTheYearWeMakeContact">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a></em>, which used small CRTs everywhere on the sets for the Discovery. (This is especially ironic as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> used rear-projection to accomplish the illusion of flatscreen monitors for the same ship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>.)

</li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienNation">Alien Nation</a></em> TV movies had people using CRT monitors well after flatscreen monitors had become cheap and readily available in the real world. This was deliberate on the part of the filmmakers... while they were still using CRT monitors, they were using much more advanced interface devices and streaming video was slightly ahead of where it is even today, several years later. This was to highlight that technology had developed in entirely different ways due to the Newcomers.

<ul><li> A passage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></em> (written in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> and set in something like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">crapsack</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieselPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieselPunk">Diesel Punk</a> universe) mentions a "super-color-four-foot-screen television set" being "erected" in a public park like it was some sort of monument. Four-foot screen would indeed look like <em>a lot</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, when the common size of a TV screen was more like four <em>inches</em>, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">the late New Tens</a> 48" TVs are in the <em>mass market</em> niche already.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedDragon">Red Dragon</a></em>, the killer works as a film developer for home movies, a profession now decades obsolete. The film updates this to him working in film-to-video transfer... <em>another</em> profession that, if not yet <em>completely</em> obsolete, is now so obscure that it's a story-breaker: if <em>both</em> victimized families had been having old filmstrips transferred to video, the FBI's investigators would have noted this incongruity as an immediate common link without the profilers' help.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em>, Dudley is complaining about the fact that Vernon taking the household to a rickety old shack on an offshore rock in an ultimately futile attempt to throw off pursuit by Hagrid means he'll miss one of his favorite TV shows. This happens in late July of 1991. If it were set today, while Dudley, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Dudley</a>, would still complain, it wouldn't mean quite as much. If anything, a first-time reader (especially if they aren't aware of the time frame, which wasn't firmly established until <em>Deathly Hallows</em>) will simply be confused about why Dudley is so upset at all.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeverlyCleary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeverlyCleary">Beverly Cleary</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MitchAndAmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MitchAndAmy">Mitch and Amy</a></em>, which is set in the 1960s, features a number of diatribes from the title characters' father. He not only takes a great deal of issue with his children watching television, he seems to object to the fact that the family <em>owns</em> one. Viewed through a modern lens, this comes across as exceedingly strange.
</li><li> The iconic intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a></em>, "The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel", is somewhat spoiled by the fact that on many modern TVs, the color you see when you turn your TV to a dead channel is <em>bright blue</em>. (In 1984 when the book was written, it would have been an ugly gray static.)
<ul><li> This is referenced and lampshaded in the first line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9sgfd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9sgfd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9sgfd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Well, the first edition, at least. The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasAlteredVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeLucasAlteredVersion">Author's Preferred Text</a>" version doesn't include it.)</span>: "The sky was the perfect blue of a television, turned to a dead channel."
</li><li> Same in Robert Sawyer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WWWTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WWWTrilogy">Wake</a></em>: "The sky above the island was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel - which is to say it was a bright, cheery blue".
<ul><li> And even that's an anachronism because modern video monitors default to black (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">or just power down outright</a>) when no signal is present.
</li><li> Although, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirecTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirecTV">Direc TV</a> and its sister service U-Verse use a blue screen to depict channels you don't get.
</li></ul></li><li> Amusingly, the original line <em>can</em> still work, but as a critique of Case's over-urbanized <em>attitude</em> rather than of the city's pollution. As initially conceived, it makes it sound like the sky is horribly contaminated; in the era of "dead" channels being blue, it sounds like it's actually a gorgeous day outside, that anybody <em>but</em> Case would find an exhilarating feat of Nature, but his bad attitude and technophilia can only compare to freaking <em>television</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePendragonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePendragonAdventure">The Pendragon Adventure</a></em>'s third installment, <em>The Never War</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutofTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutofTemporalWater">Bobby Pendragon</a> makes the mistake of asking his local counterpart Vincent "Gunny" Van Dyke where the TV is in a 1937 hotel suite.

<ul><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MADtv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MADtv">MADtv</a>'s</em> earliest regular sketches was "Lowered Expectations", a video dating service for <em>extremely</em> maladjusted individuals. Despite being hilarious, the sketches quickly became dated due to the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingServiceDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingServiceDisaster">online dating</a>, which rendered video dating services obsolete. As a result, the sketch was quietly retired by the late '90s.
</li><li> The producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> tried to hide their use of CRT monitors by embedding the screens in bulky, futuristic looking equipment with lots of lights and buttons. Unfortunately you can still see that the screens are curved, like the screens of CRT monitors in the early-mid 1990s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em>, produced in the late 20th century and set in the late 2010s/early 2020s, also used bulky CRT monitors in government buildings, corporate offices, and the Taelon Embassy, despite flat screens becoming cheaper and more ubiquitous late in the show's run.
</li><li> The signature opening Control Voice lines for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963">The Outer Limits (1963)</a></em>, about how "we are controlling transmission", specifically reference a number of technical glitches - misaligned images, blur, color distortion, rolling or flickering - that commonly afflicted early analog television sets. These days, glitches typically involve pixelation, scrambling, or judders between adjacent channels, and even the idea of "transmission", i.e. broadcasting, seems archaic in the era of cable, satellite, and streaming video. In addition, the opening monologue's most well-known lines are "we control the horizontal, we control the vertical". This referenced the fact that TVs of the era actually had controls that adjusted the vertical and horizontal width of an image, a feature that was dropped from TV sets by the end of the 1970s.
</li><li> There's an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> that goes around Al's desires to watch his favorite John Wayne movie <em>Hondo</em> that, according to him, airs every 17 years, and of course as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">he's Al Bundy</a> he missed the film after getting trapped in a store due to a computer malfunction and then after getting knocked off by said computer. When he awakes he hears the channel advising that they schedule the film to be presented again... in 2011 (the episode aired in 1994). Nowadays modern audiences will have problems grasping the concept of not being able to watch a movie whenever they want.
<ul><li> In fact, the joke was ruined almost immediately: <em>Hondo</em> got a VHS release a few months afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> There are at least two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> that exemplify this:
<ul><li> The one where all of the barflies (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and Lilith</a>) get really, <em>really</em> excited when Sam buys a <em> whopping</em> (Cliff's wording) 32-inch TV for the bar.
</li><li> The one where Sam buys a used satellite dish and it's one of those giant things people would expect SETI to be using nowadays.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em>, when Ray gets a satellite dish with all the sports packages to help with his job as a sports reporter, everyone in the neighborhood (including his parents) starts acting nicer towards both Ray himself and Debra, so they can come over to their house and watch TV.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyHatesChris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyHatesChris">Everybody Hates Chris</a></em>, when the family celebrates the fact that they could finally afford to buy a 19 inch TV, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">Adult</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisRock">Chris</a> explains that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">the early '80s'</a>, when the episode takes place, a family owning a 19 inch TV was a big deal, even though in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">the mid 2000s'</a>, when the episode aired, a 19 inch TV was a common staple in every college dorm room.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdventuresInWonderland">Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> features Alice wanting to watch a show, but she has to do her homework. A modern viewer might wonder why she doesn't just watch it on demand, while others might wonder why she didn't just record it. Even in the early 90s, when a VCR was commonplace in a lot of households like this, she might not have had a blank tape available.

The issue came out in 2009; nowadays there are several ways to watch streaming sites through your TV (even back then, the family could have used an HDMI cable to plug the computer into the TV if they <em>really</em> wanted to).

<ul><li> When a work requires background music to suddenly end for humorous purposes, nine times out of ten they'll STILL put on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordNeedleScratch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordNeedleScratch">the sound effect of a needle skating across a vinyl record.</a> This even applies to kids' shows, where it is otherwise assumed that the audience won't have a clue what vinyl records are and need it explained every time they're mentioned.
<ul><li> Also the phrase "you sound like a broken record".
</li></ul></li><li> 2010 has various examples of thrift-store tech. (i) HAL's "memory module" room was reconstructed for 2010, but alongside the original futuristic-looking memory modules, a previously unseen keyboard is used to interact with HAL (due to his damaged speech circuits). Not a dead tech, but unfortunately it looks like a typical early '80s keyboard, contrasting badly with- and looking more dated than!- the original film's inventive design. (ii) Floyd's secret failsafe cutoff for HAL is to be activated by him typing nine 9s on a hacked calculator. Again, not a dead tech, but one which would be a far less obvious "first choice" gadget for that use today than it would have been in the mid-80s when calculators were still (somewhat) new and high-tech.
</li><li> In Kevin O'Donnell's novel <em>ORA:CLE</em>, published in 1985, personal names are replaced by alphanumeric strings encoding personal attributes (including allotted public time and computer-related knowledge [!]); for example, the main character's name is ALL80 AFAHSC NFF6 (Ale Elatey for short). However, it's set in a universe where <em>all computers run unprotected operating systems like DOS</em> and <em>all news are shown in Bulletin Board Systems</em>. In <strong>2188</strong>.
</li><li> On the subject of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a>, many of the genre's works (print and video) featured extensive virtual realities that today are being realized with applications such as <em>Second Life</em>. While we can see the usefulness of VR for entertainment, education or training purposes, is it really more efficient to walk through a fully rendered VR representation of an automated factory to control and maintain operations, or would a screen of text and numbers and a keyboard be sufficient?
<ul><li> The US Navy is actually incredibly enthusiastic about using VR and Second Life in particular to train servicemen and -women on things such as submarine operation. However some of their other applications reek of "we must retroactively justify this expense."
</li></ul></li><li> When you pull up next to someone in traffic and motion to them to roll down their window, what do you do? That's right. You motion like you're rotating a lever, despite the fact that a vast majority of cars on the road these days have <em>buttons</em> to roll down windows... not levers. Still, everyone knows what you mean, presumably because levers are recent enough that everyone driving today can remember the days when they were common and also lever controlled windows are still included on vehicles (mostly base-model trucks and very cheap subcompacts) without power windows installed.
<ul><li> Credit to comedian <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveHofstetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveHofstetter">Steve Hofstetter</a> for trying to bring everyone forwards...
<div class="indent"> "I don't roll down my window. Because my car wasn't made in 1997. I vsshh down my window."
</div></li></ul></li><li> The accepted icons for saving (a floppy disc) and a movie (a roll of film) are both representations of entirely obsolete technology &mdash; but likely to last longer than the memory of the media themselves!
<ul><li> There's a joke floating around the Internet about a kid seeing a 3.5" floppy for the first time and asking "Who 3d-printed the save icon?"
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the default depiction of a phone app is a landline phone headset. Except that the vast majority of phones&mdash;partocularly those in homes&mdash;are flat rectangles with no such handsets.
</li><li> People still use the term "dial a number" when telephones haven't used dials for decades.
</li><li> Many pictograms of telephones are also hopelessly out of date, ranging from the depiction of just the phone receiver, which looks a bit too clunky for today's standards, over the "classical" key phone with the receiver sitting on top like a torero hat, to the same design, but with a dial plate. Likewise, pictograms that tell you to switch off your cell phone can hardly keep pace with the rapidly evolving appearance of said cell phones.
</li><li> We also turn our finger in a twisting motion when we're asking someone to turn volume up or down, despite the fact that most devices now have buttons with up and down arrows on them. Granted, some speakers have dials, and so do many MP3 players, but those are outnumbered by the buttoned devices.
</li><li> The party game Charades has a standard action to indicate a film that consists of holding one hand as a fist in front of the face (the camera lens) while the other makes a winding motion nearby, mimicking manually winding the film through a camera. Needless to say, even film cameras haven't needed manual winding for many decades now; that dates back to the very early days of cinema.
</li><li> The use of double-spacing at the end of sentences. This is a hold-over from the days of typewriters with their monospacing (where every character occupies the same amount of space), to help the period stand out. Such a necessity has long been rendered obsolete by digital word-processors and just plain looks silly when used nowadays, but a lot of older typists (or younger ones taught by them), still use two spaces after periods. Even on this very wiki, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">That Other Wiki</a> and other MediaWiki-based wikis generally format pages so only one space is displayed even if more than one is typed into the code for the page.
<ul><li> It's still a handy method for students to pad papers that are to be a certain number of pages long. Two spaces at the end of every sentence adds up.
<ul><li> It's not just useful for padding, either: double-spacing at the ends of sentences helps to visually distinguish one sentence from the next. This makes proofreading their paragraphs slightly easier for the student, and assessment of the finished product's content and grammar <em>significantly</em> easier for the teacher. Especially a teacher whose eyes are already tired from scanning many other essays.
</li></ul></li><li> And this practice continues to serve its original purpose if something is to be printed in Courier or another typewriter-like font.
</li><li> It's also a handy habit when texting or writing notes on a cell phone, as adding the second space after the end of a sentence will cause the text function to automatically insert a period.
</li><li> Ever proving the ancient maxim, "There's the right way, the wrong way, and the Army way," The U.S. Department of Defense (which shows up on this page in several places) still uses the "two space" rule in official correspondence, even though the proportional Times New Roman is the mandatory font, and still has instructions like "indent three spaces," which don't make much sense when using proportional fonts.
</li></ul></li><li> Even though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> switched to an electronic puzzleboard in 1997, people still refer to the letters being "turned" as if they were still physical trilons.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://carnal.orfinlir.de/">third party<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> book (not quite SFW) refers to Polaroid pictures with the spell "Irnar's Polaroidic Pregnancy" (shortens the pregnancy to 9 hours). The guide isn't quite complete, and the name is yet to be changed.
</li><li> "Hi-fi" used to mean a stereo system, and is a bit outdated in these days of MP3 players. (As a term for <em>high-fidelity sound</em> it is still used by people in the sound industry). This is a bit troublesome tech-wise for people having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithPalindromes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithPalindromes">Fun with Palindromes</a> because "If I had a hi-fi" is still a popular palindrome in books, etc.
</li><li> People are often told to cut the doors off refrigerators before throwing them away, to keep playful children from being locked inside and suffocating. However, this only applies to older fridges with latch handles that are impossible to open from the inside. Fridges built since the '80s, however, use magnetic strips to hold the door shut, which can be easily opened from either side.
</li><li> In April 2016, the National Weather Service <a class="urllink" href="http://www.noaa.gov/national-weather-service-will-stop-using-all-caps-its-forecasts">announced that they would stop "shouting" at viewers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. For decades, they transmitted their weather reports using teletype, essentially a typewriter connected to a phone line, which only allowed for all-caps, MEANING THEIR FORECASTS WOULD ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS. It worked fine for most of the 20th century, but once the Internet took off in the '90s and teletype became obsolete, using all caps implied yelling, especially in forecasts posted to social media. They <em>wanted</em> to start using mixed cases back then, but unsurprisingly for a government agency, it took them an extra twenty years to completely phase out the old equipment that only accepted teletype.
<ul><li> This is why the Weather Channel, back when they actually showed weather forecasts, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYXyGA8o_Xw">looked like this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The folk-legend that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires don't show up in mirrors or photography</a> is because mirrors used to consist of a thin sheet of silver protected by glass, and silver compounds were used in film, in addition to the reflex mirror inside the camera. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverBullet">Silver is considered a holy substance</a>, hence why nothing undead would show up in it. But mirrors nowadays use cheaper aluminum for its reflective surface, a much less "picky" metal, and digital photography has all but replaced film and the silver-based emulsion fluids that went with it. There's also the fact that a vampire who doesn't appear on camera means not appearing in security footage, smartphones, or the media, which would remove the dramatic tension of maintaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> in modern times. As a result, this has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgottenTrope">Forgotten Trope</a> in vampire fiction.
<ul><li> Some Vampire stories have taken the 'Vampires don't show up in things' and run with it. In the TV series Ultraviolet, for example, a Vampire wouldn't show in any mirror, camera, or even sound equipment. Vampires had text-to-speech devices to allow them to use telephones, whilst the show's Vampire hunters had guns with a small camera and TV screen attached - point it at a room full of people and anyone who didn't show up on the screen was a target. One episode even features a woman who was pregnant with a Vampire child, with Doctors constantly telling her it was a false pregnancy because nothing showed up on their ultrasound.
</li><li> This is lampshaded in What We Do In The Shadows (the movie rather than the TV show) in that the main three vampires draw each other pictures of what the others look like when getting dressed to go out, but once they meet Nick and Stu (one a newly-turned vampire and the other his IT-guy friend), they are delighted to find that digital cameras and even webcams work for them.
</li></ul></li><li> A once-popular method of suicide that still occasionally comes up in fiction is sticking one's head in the oven. Young people might see this and get confused ("Is he going to <em>cook</em> himself to death?"), but older gas ranges didn't automatically light. Turning the knob simply released the gas, and you'd light it yourself. That is, unless you're suicidal, in which case you'd lay your head on the oven floor until you drifted off to eternal slumber. Furthermore, until the 1970s the gas was coal gas (also called town gas) and contained significant amounts of toxic carbon monoxide. Natural gas used currently is nontoxic, though it can cause asphyxiation by displacing oxygen.
<ul><li> Even locking one's self in the garage with the engine running has fallen prey to this trope. CO emissions are now so well-scrubbed in modern gasoline cars, people attempting suicide by this method have fallen asleep and woken back up with the engine still running.
</li></ul></li><li> Banking. Back in the day, most transactions required paper checks and people had to "balance the checkbook" to track their account balance, as the bank would only provide it once a month by mail. Nowadays, banks do all the math and provide live balances online. Deposits and withdrawals used to require going to a bank branch during banking hours and interacting with a teller, then ATMs made this possible 24/7, and now checks can de deposited with a smartphone by taking a picture. For the most part paper checks have become obsolete, most employers can direct deposit paychecks into bank accounts, credit and debit cards replaced paper checks for merchant use, and payment apps like Zelle and Venmo for personal payments. Nonetheless, registers in grocery and department stores are still equipped to receive checks, mostly for elderly customers who have grown accustomed to writing them for so long. On the other hand, large purchases like cars and home down payments often require a cashier's check, which is still physically printed, and landlords (especially older ones) might still require cashier's checks and/or money orders for payment. But even this may be phased out, with the aforementioned Zelle and Venmo apps, PayPal, and even card-swiping devices such as Square for phones and tablets. It is unlikely, however, to disappear completely, because one group <em>does</em> rely on paper checks: the government, and just check the rest of this page to determine how good they are at quickly updating their technology.
<ul><li> This is in countries which had only had the check-based banking system. In countries with the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankgirotransfer.asp">giro<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> banking system, everything was initiated by the payer instead of the payee: the former had the knowledge of the latter's bank account number, went to the bank and told the teller they wanted to transfer a certain amount of money - one could even directly "transfer"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10m9m1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10m9m1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10m9m1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">that is the name for an "between-accounts deposit" in a giro system - it's basically like a wire transfer via a Western Union-like service, but between bank accounts</span> from one account to the other (which could in theory be with the same bank or with another bank), without the payer having to cash out of their account and then into the payee's account - and the bank took care of the remaining bureaucracy, automatically balancing the account(s) (taking out the money from the payer's account, if it had been there in the first place, and putting it in the payee's) and the payee had his money right in his account the next time he went to the bank, without needing to previously authorize/later accept or even previously know of this deposit.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11761s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11761s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11761s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Contrast this with the check-based system, where the transfer of money had to be started by the payee and - implicitly or explictly - authorized or accepted by the payer.</span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12qrvn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12qrvn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12qrvn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In case you're wondering, one could not just go to the bank, have knowledge of one's bank account number, and then cash out said account: that needed the previous authorization of the account holder.</span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13e2mh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13e2mh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13e2mh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Countries with giro systems also used checks, although these were secondary to the main system, and there the normal rules with checks applied.</span> Technology has blurred the lines between the check-based and giro systems a bit, although there are still differences: deposits still have to be authorized/accepted by the payee, there is no "between-accounts deposit" and there is higher use of PayPal-like apps in banking systems vs. the situation in giro systems. Actual checks see much more use even today in check-based systems than in gyro systems.
</li></ul></li><li> Ever wonder why there were very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentShow">Edutainment Shows</a> centered on teaching educational concepts to children in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>? A research study conducted by Disney back when they were about to rebrand their Playhouse Disney block into Disney Junior in 2010 showed that most kids learn important preschool topics via computer games and smartphone and tablet applications, and usually watch television for entertainment. Disney used this research to create the shows on the block, and it was successful, leading to a number of children's networks adding non-educational or morals-based preschool programming to their lineups. When Disney conducted the same survey in 2005 and 2000, parents wanted their kids to be educated by TV since computers weren't exactly a common commodity back then, although they were starting to become popular.
</li><li> Writing letters. Many schoolchildren up until the 2000's were required to learn how to properly write a letter, but in later decades, the practice became obsolete. Nowadays the vast majority of physical letters mailed are business-related, and many companies will offer incentive for consumers to forgo paper communication altogether as a costcutting measure.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14k9ej');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14k9ej" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14k9ej');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They'll still send a letter if they <em>really</em> need to get in touch with you, say because they're going to cut service, since it's still seen as more formal than an email.</span> Nowadays, personal correspondence via mail is usually situational: wedding invites, greeting cards, etc. It's rare for someone to actually compose a personal letter to a loved unless they have a reason for doing so (incarceration being a prime example). For basic chit-chat, electronic communication is simply faster and less hassle. Interestingly, even email has fallen out of favor outside of work because it's not instant like texting, DM's, or "old-fashioned" talking on the phone.

Of course that was before they had dust repellent paper. And if you're interested in dust, we have a quaint little piece from the 1980s. It's called a Dustbuster."
</div><ul><li> Funnily enough, the Dustbuster continues to enjoy popularity and has even taken on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandNameTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandNameTakeover">Brand Name Takeover</a>.

Today, many watches are waterproof to as many as <em>50</em> atmospheres.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15iswd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15iswd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15iswd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although if you're that far underwater, you've got other things to worry about than 'What time is it?'</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeBandits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeBandits">Time Bandits</a></em>, the embodiment of evil explains that he knows better than the Supreme Being because he has knowledge of "Digital watches. Soon I shall have knowledge of video cassette recorders and car telephones. And when I understand those I shall understand computers. And when I understand computers <strong>I</strong> will be the Supreme Being." In 1981, those really were cutting edge and were meant to be. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Now they can be considered evidence that Evil is a little out of touch</a>.

Digital cameras completely took over once they became a standard feature on cell phones, and if the movie had come out even five years later, it would've needed a period setting to explain why people were still dropping off film cartridges to be developed into photos.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FerrisBuellersDayOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FerrisBuellersDayOff">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a></em>, Ferris' line "I asked for a car, I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?" seems strange today. A typical teen in 1986 wouldn't know what to do with a computer, but every teen in modern times would like his or her own private computer for social messaging, file sharing, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternetIsForPorn">pornography</a>.

</li><li> The original (circa 1980) edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Superfudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Superfudge">Superfudge</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume">Judy Blume</a> had Peter asking for and receiving a pocket calculator for Christmas. Later editions change the gift to a check from Grandma since, by about 2000, a regular calculator was a standard school supply and could be bought for about a dollar. He asks for a stereo in the original, but only in jest. Current editions have him ask instead for a laptop and MP3 player, and by 2010, it's hard to tell whether the latter was supposed to be an outrageous request.
</li><li> In the original print of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AreYouThereGodItsMeMargaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AreYouThereGodItsMeMargaret">Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyBlume">Judy Blume</a>, Margaret is instructed in the proper use of a belt to secure her menstrual pad. The invention of menstrual pads with adhesive backing (something often taken for granted these days) had to wait until women's undergarments became snug enough for adhesive pads to be practical, which in turn required the invention of Spandex and cheaper methods of creating inexpensive fine-gauge cotton knits.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack">Repairman Jack</a> first appeared in <em>The Tomb</em>, written in the early 1980s, Jack had to put in a lot of work to maintain his anonymity but still find customers and stay off the grid. Actually renting an office under an assumed name with nothing in it but a phone and an answering machine, multiple mail boxes under multiple names that he would check for mail daily, always using pay phones, etc. Jump ahead to the present day and he's ditched the office and the answering machine and the mail boxes and just uses a web page with a phone number and email address displayed, buys cheap no-plan phones that he pays cash for and replenishes the minutes with using prepaid credit cards, etc.
</li><li> The protagonists in Ken Grimwood's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Replay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Replay">Replay</a></em> are stuck in a 25-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> from 1963 to 1988, so it isn't surprising this pops up. The author had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">shown his work</a> though, by pointing out that some devices could be procured before they caught on with the public (though they were expensive) there were appearances of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wang1200.org/">Wang 1200<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%22_type_C_videotape">Sony VTR<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The following quote happens in 1974:
<div class="indent">"Near the window was a large desk stacked with books and notebooks, and in the center of it sat a bulky, greenish-gray device that incorporated a video screen, a keyboard, and a printer. He frowned quizzically at it. What was she doing with a home computer so early? ... 'It's not a computer,' Pamela said. 'Wang 1200 word processor, one of the first. No disk drive, just cassettes, but still beats a typewriter. Want a beer?'"
</div></li><li> The famous quote from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> that humans are so primitive "they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea." Funny in the late '70s, a bit baffling by the early '90s (they had marched on from being impractical high-tech gadgets to a commonplace item nobody would call "neat"), rather on-the-nose now.
<ul><li> The radio adaptations in the mid-2000s had novelty ringtones instead. Not quite as dated yet.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> defended the original line from a copy editor who wanted to modernise it to cellphones. According to Douglas, digital watches are <em>inherently</em> ridiculous (in the middle of a period defined by finding visual ways to show information clearly, we took the graphic display we'd had since medieval times and replaced it with a string of numbers, just because we could) in a way that cellphones aren't. As long as humanity continues to believe there's a <em>point</em> to digital watches, he considered the "pretty neat idea" dig valid.

</li><li> An instructor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> was blinded in combat. Towards the end of his class, he feels the watchface to see how much time is left. Maybe he couldn't afford a talking watch.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16caju');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16caju" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16caju');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although <a class="urllink" href="https://www.maxiaids.com/maxi-aids-braille-watches">braille watches<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are still being manufactured and sold in 2017, so it may have been simple personal preference.</span> Soon it's likely that readers will be asking why he didn't get prosthetic eyes.
</li><li> An inventor in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadPast">The Dead Past</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> demonstrates his newest gadget, a time viewer. He turns on the monitor, then warns his impatient colleague to "let it warm up." When the story was written, televisions used vacuum tubes and frequently took 30 seconds to a minute to display a picture after being turned on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParisInTheTwentiethCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParisInTheTwentiethCentury">Paris in the Twentieth Century</a></em>, written in 1862 and taking place in the distant future of 1960, makes some rather impressive predictions about the future. One of the reasons it wasn't published had to do with the publisher finding stuff like electro-mechanical calculators, widespread use of automobiles, fax machines, skyscrapers, automatic security systems and remote-controlled warfare too unrealistic. On the other hand, people still write using quills, records are still kept in books (that is, a colossal book apparently four meters tall, whose pages are turned with machinery) and there is apparently no air transport (except the odd airship or two, probably).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarsMyDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarsMyDestination">The Stars My Destination</a></em>, tattoo removal becomes a plot point. The main character needs to remove a clearly identifying facial tattoo forced on him by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult">Cargo Cult</a>, and the removal process involved bleaching out the tattoo by injecting acid into his skin while he is awake and screaming. The book was written in 1957, three years before the invention of the laser, let alone laser tattoo removal. There is some dialogue in the book suggesting that tattooing is a lost art in the future, and tattoo removal would not be a priority in a culture without tattoos.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Shows</a>: Watch any classic episode of a game show that offers prizes, particularly prior to 1990 (or even 2000), and you'll see electronics and other items that were cutting edge then that are today outdated.
<ul><li> Examples include the countless <strong>video cassette recorders</strong> (first offered circa 1978, when they cost $1,000 or more and were considered a "grand prize"(!)), the <strong>Muntz projection TV</strong> (the "deluxe" style of television viewing, with a (gasp) 3-by-4 foot viewing screen) and the <strong>large satellite dishes</strong> (from companies such as General Instruments). <strong>Cellular car telephones</strong>, which were worth $3,000(!), was a common top-level prize, as were <strong>portable telephones</strong>.
<ul><li> Several shows also offered an "<strong>entertainment center</strong>" &#150; basically a stand with several dividers, which went along with the TV, VCR, audio equipment, connectors and remote control &#150; whose components today would be worthless (except for perhaps the audio components, even though there's virtually no market today for cassette tapes and even compact discs are declining in share).
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Computers</strong> are another common example. Take a look at, for instance, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TicTacDough">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></em> episode from 1979, when the Apple II computer was offered as a prize (worth $2,000-plus(!), counting the disk drives, monitor and printer that came with it) ... state of the art for the time with its 64K memory (expandable to double it), and people were truly excited about winning one. Today, it's a museum piece, and even low-end modern computers have several gigabytes of RAM. Commodore, Radio Shack and Texas Instruments also saw their computers given away as game show prizes (with and without the other items), and likewise, except for hobbyists, these computers have long since become obsolete.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Tic Tac Dough</em>, each of those video screens on the big board was generated by its own Apple II, in stunning 16-color 40x40 lo-res graphics, with the nine Apples networked by an Altair 8800. Compare, at the time, the 1978-79 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>, which still used <em>printed cards</em> on their big board! By 1984, when the Alex Trebek edition of <em>Jeopardy!</em> debuted, its 30-screen board made <em>Tic Tac Dough</em>'s board look quaint by comparison.
</li><li> Years before Skype and other no-cost proprietary voice-over-IP services, there were videophones. At least one episode of the 1980s version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighRollers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighRollers">High Rollers</a></em>, which is uploaded to various video sharing sites, offers <strong>video phones</strong> (a $500 item) as a prize; it was touted as state-of-the-art way to see and hear the people you're talking to. Videophones differ in one key respect from all the other items in this entry in that nobody really wanted them. Video chat systems, the modern equivalent, are nothing like as popular as voice only or text chat.
</li><li> Speaking of music devices, one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaleOfTheCentury">Sale of the Century</a></em> shopping-level prize was a $12,000 <strong>video jukebox</strong>. Users deposited their money into the jukebox and chose one of several selections which the machine would pick out and play on the video screen. They date back to the 1940s and have seen several evolutions over the years, from the 1940s Soundies on black-and-white 16mm film, to the 1960s Scopitones on color 16mm film, to the 1980s Rowe International videocasette jukeboxes offered on <em>Sale of the Century</em>, to the current models that stream videos via WiFi and are much more compact than the physical-media-based models of old.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CentralParkWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CentralParkWest">Central Park West</a></em> had characters use a very primitive form of email (which had just been introduced into the workplace around the time the series was created), and didn't have any modern functions such as inactivity timeout, password protection or full text editor. A large part of stockbroker Gil Chase's storyline is that several characters (including his ex-girlfriend and a romantic rival) are able to access his email without any password and nearly destroy his reputation by playing havoc with his contacts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Double Sting," from the first season, sees Rosco using a large "field telephone" to communicate with Enos. The field telephone was typically used only by law enforcement (and in large cities, more populous counties and state agencies at that) and the very rich in 1979. Today, everyone &#150; even in the most backwoods of communities &#150; is using cell phones and iPhones, perhaps videophone sites like Skype just like the rest of us.
</li><li> "Uncle Boss," taped in 1979 but aired during the third season, sees Boss Hogg's corrupt nephew, Hughie, introduce Boss and Rosco to the state-of-the-art technological marvel ... the video cassette recorder! Quite a bit of time is dedicated to explaining how one of these contraptions work. Although its purpose in the plot is to attempt to frame Bo and Luke for bank robbery (as a security camera is attached to the VCR), there may have been a subliminal message in it all &#150; buy a VCR and you capture the Dukes on tape ... every week! In any case, the VCR has long met its match, and banks typically now use hard drives and hidden security cameras to monitor banks. In addition, note that Boss and Hughie hand-deliver the videotape with the incriminating evidence to the FBI ... but get detoured into a junkyard and are held up briefly by Cooter's magnet(!), which erases the tape; today, Boss could simply send the footage of his "bank robbery" to the FBI via a private Internet connection (such as file transfer protocol, or ftp, site), making his favorite scheme of hiring impersonators to pull off a "Duke boy bank robbery" even easier to accomplish without Bo and Luke even having a clue what's going on ... until federal authorities converge on the farm with warrants for their arrest.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>: Around the mid-1980s, Oscar the Grouch owned a "grouch computer." The buzzword back then was "friendly computer," which simply meant easy to use; of course, with Oscar involved, the "friendly greetings" were replaced by "grouch" ones. Other Sesame Street residents (notably, Luis and Maria) also owned a computer. All segments with computers were used to teach basic computer skills and workings of computers. And of course, these were computers that were state-of-the-art for the era, at a time when they were far less common.
</li><li> In the pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>, the Kents' use of a fax machine was presented as evidence they weren't subject to the old-time "American Gothic" farmer stereotypes. Now it has the opposite effect of making them seem out-of-date.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rescue911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rescue911">Rescue 911</a></em>, the prevalence of carbon monoxide poisonings looks weird to modern audiences because carbon monoxide alarms are about as common as fire alarms. Possibly a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">"Seinfeld" Is Unfunny</a>, as said poisonings were what led to demand for the development of an alarm that would detect carbon monoxide.
</li><li> On an older episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> Lenny got a lead by looking at the victim's pager. Remember pagers?
</li><li> Beepers were parodied in the 2006 series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> via character Dennis Duffy the "Beeper King" who just <em>knew</em> that they would make a comeback.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carrusel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Carrusel">Carrusel</a></em>, video games were not present at all. While this was Mexico in 1989-1990, the Brazilian 2012 remake did insert them, since it would no longer be credible to have a show about children's school and daily life without video games present in any way.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em>, Jessica's practice of recording audio versions of her novels was slated to be discontinued, because her publisher claimed there weren't enough <em>blind people</em> to maintain demand. The notion that sighted people might want to listen to novels on digital media - or even a personal cassette-player, already commonplace when the series aired - evidently hadn't crossed anyone's mind.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf">Airwolf</a></em> revolved around a Vietnamese boy who might have been the son of Stringfellow's missing brother St. John, and the end of the episode has Archangel lamenting the fact that they may never know if the boy really is St. John's son and String's nephew. Within 10 years of that episode airing, taking a cheek swab of both would have answered that question in a few weeks. In the current day, with the technology the the Firm presumably would have access to, it could have been answered in a few <em>hours</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace">Rupauls Drag Race</a></em>: In the first six seasons, each episode would begin with "You've Got She-Mail," a brief video clip where Ru would give the contestants hints towards that week's main challenge. It was a pun on America Online's famous "You've got mail" alert. Even though the soundbite was removed from the show following complaints from transgender viewers ("she-male" is a slur against trans women), it had another problem: it was <em>dated</em>. Even in 2008 when <em>Drag Race</em> first premiered, AOL had already faded to irrelevance as users had jumped ship en masse for broadband. Young people watching (or competing on) the show might not even remember when "You've got mail" was in its heyday.

This was a stripped-down Asian cellular phone service based around CDMA technology aimed at the personal market, which had a reputation for only being used by children or poor people. PHS became obsolete around the time that anyone could get powerful mobile phone coverage for extremely cheap, and few people remember it even in its home market &mdash; in the West, where PHS was never used, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a>.

Cell phones appear to be common, but not used frequently in the slums, possibly due to lack of coverage.

The game takes place in 1998, which wouldn't make typewriters and slides look too out of place, but typewriters had already fallen out of common use by that point. It makes sense in the setting of the first game though, which took place in a seemingly abandoned old mansion, but the franchise kept using typewriters throughout the sequels, with many of them spread out throughout Raccoon City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3">Resident Evil 3</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17vskr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17vskr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17vskr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The original intent of the typewriter in <em>Resident Evil</em> is probably lost on people that have only played the remake (which lacks the explanation): when saving, the character is making a hardcopy of everything that they've done up to that point in-universe, in case anyone investigating their disappearance happens to stumble across it. Basically the equivalent of writing notes to other characters.</span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> would be the first game to abandon the typewriter system in favor of simply having auto-saves after each checkpoint. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7">Resident Evil 7</a></em> did away with auto-saves, but didn't bring typewriters back; instead, saving is done in tape recorders.

Also, things like irrigation, currency (first copper coins, later printed paper money), and new crops like tea and rice will appear over the course of the campaign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> has Mr. X give Raiden a phone, described in its description as an ordinary cellphone. However, it's an ordinary (good quality) cellphone as would be in 2001; by the real 2009, phone technology had gone in a broadly unexpected direction. The script actually notes this: <em>Raiden stares at the cell phone (a current, therefore old, model).</em>

In those times, the only way to procure ice outside of winter would be to go all the way to the Arctic for it, and ice-selling businesses were a booming enterprise during the summer months. "Artificial" ice produced in factories didn't become a thing until the turn of the century, and it took several decades for refrigeration technology to reach the point where people could just make it at home.

Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">The Jungle Movie</a></em>, where thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> smartphones and Bob's unwillingness to get with the times have put him in financial dire straits.
<ul><li> One of the reasons a lot of kids thought Arnold's room was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyPorn">Technology Porn</a> was the presence of a CD player. CD players <em>did</em> exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, but they were <em>quite</em> expensive (Almost $330 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTwenties">The New '20s</a>, and that's a <em>cheaper</em> sound system) so they would <em>not</em> be a common sight in the room of a fourth grader.
</li></ul></li><li> Multiple cartoons in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> featured people using tapes, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepperAnn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepperAnn">Pepper Ann</a></em>.

Bank vaults usually have a button or other mechanism that allows people to open the door from the inside (not to mention every vault would have cameras inside, so the person watching the cameras could see something was wrong), which means the bank Brian and Stewie were at was <em>extremely</em> old with just as old architecture or they got trapped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">for the sake of drama and tension.</a>
