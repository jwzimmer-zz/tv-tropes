It can be people, places, objects, anything up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. Maybe they didn't check their facts, or maybe they did after all, but they assumed (perhaps rightly, perhaps not) that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">didn't need to be accurate</a> if they were using names and figures in a new context and purpose. It's not necessarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">Faux Symbolism</a>, because often they don't even pretend to have intended some deep religious meaning behind it.
</p><p>To be fair, many ancient sources don't agree on the specific interpretations of individual myths and legends, and many ancient writers would reinterpret them to prove whatever point they were trying to make. For example, most contemporary portrayals of the sorceress Medea have the deaths of her children be an accident, or a case of mistaken interpretation where the children turn out all right at the end. It wasn't until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Medea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Medea">Euripides' play</a> that Medea was turned into the purposeful murderess of her own offspring (even if she had the tiniest bit of sympathetic motivation for doing so), making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.

</p><p>In Western media, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusTaboo">Jesus Taboo</a> and the like, pagan mythologies are more susceptible. The Japanese, on the other hand, have no qualms about bizarre portrayals of Christianity &mdash; or Shinto, for that matter.
</p><p>Sometimes this is the result of cultural appropriation where the cultural practices of one group are picked up by other people which sometimes causes myths or rituals to take on new meanings.

<ul><li> Pandora Jewelry. Sounds innocent enough... but if you know <em>the actual myth of Pandora</em>, it is HILARIOUS. The SparkNotes version? Woman opens tempting-looking box and unleashes evil upon the world. All the valuable blessings inside were lost just because she opened the box for the first time. And there wasn't even a box! The real container was a water jug called an amphora, but the words for box and jug were similar enough to confuse, and we all know how that's turned out!

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>. The goddesses Urd, Belldandy and Skuld are named after the Norns (Verthandi, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">contains sounds not available in Japanese</a>, was not checked against the original Norse, creating "Belldandy" in the translation). Or more accurately, the primary Norns, who were responsible for overseeing the fate of Yggdrasil rather than any of the individuals who lived in it, who were watched by the countless number of lesser Norns (This is alluded to by having the sisters work at maintaining the Yggdrasil computer before coming to Earth in the story). Their connection to past, present and future is actually borrowing from the legend of the <em>Greek</em> fates. The goddesses are also the daughters of Tyr, despite the fact that there was no connection between their myths (the Norns are technically Jotuns, not Aesir or Vanir).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>, Centaurmon is the monster based on the Centaur that lives in a Labyrinth. One really wonders if the designers were instead thinking of the Minotaur.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarianAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarianAge">Aquarian Age</a></em>, the "Age of Aquarius" is... a secret war that's gone on for thousands of years. As opposed to, y'know, a time of peace and prosperity that's recently begun or about to begin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LedaTheFantasticAdventureOfYohko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LedaTheFantasticAdventureOfYohko">Leda: The Fantastic Adventure of Yohko</a></em> includes two characters named Lingam and Yoni, which are not only symbolic for Hindu deities, but refer to the male and female sex organs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> and another series of the <em>Mazinger</em> universe (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger">Shin Mazinger</a></em>) did this with the Greek myths.
<ul><li> In the original myths Hades was the God of Underworld, his default shape was humanoid (but like all Greek deities he was a shape-shifter), and even though he was not exactly a nice guy, he was not worse than his relatives. In the Mazinverse he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> whose (unchangeable) shape is that of a giant being of fire and wishes conquering the surface world.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZMazinger">Z Mazinger</a> is worse in that regard: the Greek gods were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> that ancient Greeks mistook for gods, Zeus was a rebel turned on their comrades to protect the humans, and Mazinger was his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>.
</li><li> Again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShinMazinger">Shin Mazinger</a></em> Zeus shows up but he is way different of the myth -let's say his severed hand is used to build the God Scrander-, and Hades is again a flaming, humongous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a>.

In Norse mythology, there are various ways the story is said to have gone down, but the gist of it is that Loki kills Baldr, or tricks someone else into it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>, and sets off a massive war by killing the god everyone loved. In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamiAso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamiAso">Kami Aso</a>, though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Loki <em>had</em> to kill Baldr because Baldr was fated to transform from the God of Light into the God of Destruction - something about balance. But Loki was actually in love with Baldr and didn't want to have to kill him. After some heartwrenching drama, and heartwarming moments as the rest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology">Crossover Cosmology</a> harem tries to save them, Baldr doesn't have to die in the end, and they can be happy together.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em> blundered badly with this. Supposedly, there are lots and lots of gods out there of various planets, yet there's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>, and he's still the mastermind of all the Akuma Choujin/Demon Supermen. But Choujin don't go to Hell, they go to an underworld led by Choujin Enma. Then there's Ashuraman, who at least is correct in his depiction as a three-faced, six-armed individual. Of course, then we find out about his teacher, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Samson Teacher</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who later becomes Satan Cross, one of the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">subordinates</a>,</span> who displays similar similar anatomy but has no reference to biblical Samson <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or Satan</span> at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> there's a scene of Eriol expressing the spirit of church hymns...Except he totally didn't do the research, and winds up describing Shinto instead of Christianity.

<ul><li> The series justifies its treatment of Heretic Gods because this trope occurs in universe. Older gods are integrated into new religions, their natures and origins twisted to fit the new theology. Heretic Gods manifest when they rebel against some aspect of the Myth that has been layered on them over the years, such as a victorious god seeking defeat or a subordinate goddess seeking to regain her lost throne.
<ul><li> Example: Athena began existence as the dominant mother goddess of her people and was represented by a serpent. When she was adopted into the Greek pantheon, she was split into the dual aspects of Athena the goddess and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Medusa">Medusa</a> the serpent. Medusa was slain by Perseus, representing the loss of her power, and Athena became the daughter of Zeus, thus subordinating her to him.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em>: Norse myth gets played very fast and loose. However, after (one presumes) a lot of corrections by mail, the writers did attempt to explain some of it by having the Norse gods be continually destroyed in Ragnarok and then reborn, with small differences between incarnations.
<ul><li> Thor:
<ul><li> The original Thor was a bearded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead">Fiery Redhead</a>, which was symbolic to the Norse. Though Marvel didn't <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor">originate the idea<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, their Thor is clean-shaven and blond, which meant something completely different to the Norse. (Though characters change their appearance often, and Thor has, on occasions, grown a beard.)
</li><li> Indeed, Thor's rugged beauty and universal popularity in Asgard seemed at first to make him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a> between Thor and Balder. That's complicated by Balder himself being a character in the comics as well.
</li><li> Thor was married to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sif">the goddess Sif<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but that did not stop him from fathering children with giantesses or romancing a mortal woman.
</li><li> Thor is portrayed as a noble, inspiring, modern hero but the Thor of myth doesn't really fit that label (he predates it). He was an ill-tempered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, and a womanizer who probably wouldn't be tied down to a single mortal woman. This is eventually addressed in universe, as Thor is often portrayed that way in his younger days, and he has tried to change as the definition of hero has changed.
</li></ul></li><li> Sif:
<ul><li> Sif's signatures were her long golden hair and demure demeanor. The Marvel version is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenafication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenafication">Xenafied</a> brunette. This is explained by saying that her hair was initially blond, but was changed after Loki cut it off. In the original story, Loki had the dwarves forge her a wig of pure gold, and that is the golden hair she is known for. She was never brunette in any of the original lore.
</li><li> Sif's whole identity is predicated on her roles as fertility figure and Thor's wife: her very name is a word relating to familial ties (cognate to a plural Norse word for your inlaws, and Modern English sibling). And she's passive in the extant myths. (The hair thing may be a metaphor for farming: harvest this year's grain, and invest time and resources in the replacement crop, in which case she symbolises <em>soil</em>.) Having her fighting is even weirder than Aphrodite/Venus.
</li></ul></li><li> Loki:
<ul><li> Loki is Odin's adopted son, rather than his blood brother, as he is in the myths. (And ergo he should be Thor's <em>step-uncle</em>.) Loki is a blood brother to Thor as well. Loki is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">Trickster</a> in the original mythology, rather than an outright bad guy. However, his relationship to the gods becomes increasingly antagonistic over time, and he ends up fighting against them.
</li><li> They also got some of his parentage wrong. Loki is known as Laufeysen in the original myths, but not because Laufey is his father like in the comics. Laufey is actually the name of his <em>mother</em>. Loki has to use a matronymic rather than a patronymic because his father Farbaurti disowned him for being, by Jotun standards, small.
</li></ul></li><li> The relationships between the gods are a real rat's nest.
<ul><li> Balder isn't portrayed as Thor's brother in older comics, just his friend. Later stories rectify this and explain that he was raised to believe he was a foundling.
</li><li> Hoder is said to be Thor's cousin in some comics. In the myths, he's Odin's son (Balder's twin brother, in fact) and would have to be Thor's <em>half-brother</em>.
</li><li> Frey is portrayed as Idunn's brother and Freyja's father. He was actually Freyja's brother and Idunn's... it's not clear, but by some accounts her uncle. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bld5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3bld5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bld5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's possible they're going for a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CompositeCharacter/DecompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CompositeCharacter/DecompositeCharacter">Decomposite Character</a> thing, since the character called Freyja has more in common with Odin's wife Frigga, while this Idunn has more in common with the mythical Freyja. </span>
</li></ul></li><li> Amora the Enchantress is based on Freya, who <em>was</em> indeed an enchantress, and very beautiful but she was never evil. And what kind of name for a <em>Norse</em> goddess is Amora, anyway? Freyja shows up later as a separate being.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/Ragnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/Ragnarok">Ragnarok</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manhwa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manhwa">manhwa</a> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> Loki and the woman Fenrir, which people like to pair up. In mythology Loki was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">trickster</a> god and Fenrir was not only his <em>son</em>, but an <em>absolutely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">gigantic</a> wolf</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> has this too.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Wonder Woman (1942)</a></em>: The Golden Age stories played fast and loose with mythology, with Olympians often presented alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualInterplanetaryTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualInterplanetaryTravel">Casual Interplanetary Travel</a> that made it seem they could just as easily be aliens as gods.
<ul><li> Aphrodite is treated as the Amazon's peaceful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a> while the classical Aphrodite was considered someone to fear and was a very jealous goddess. She also had next to nothing to do with the Amazons. Her lover Ares/Mars was considered their "father" and the literal father of Hippolyte as the consort of their previous Queen but she did not have direct contact with them and was not one of the gods they were considered to worship.
</li><li> Athena/Minerva never shows up, but is attributed as the goddess of wisdom and craftsmanship. While these have basis in myth she was first and foremost the Goddess of War, and her wisdom is of a tactical nature which is not considered a part of her portfolio here.
</li><li> Diana/Artemis has both her most well known mythological aspects of hunting and the moon tied to her, but here she also lives on the moon and rules the local people. She's also no stronger than an Amazon, and seems to be even weaker and a less impressive fighter than Diana of Paradise Island.
</li><li> Mars is treated as the brutish ruler of an oppressive kingdom on the planet Mars and hates women and Aphrodite. In mythology he was Aphrodite's most consistant lover and risked himself to aid her.
</li><li> Mercury/Hermes is presented as the god of speed, rather than travelers, thieves and messengers.
</li><li> While Pluto's weapon makes it clear he's inspired by the mythological one the odd ruler of the planetoid is not even presented as related to the Olympians and instead seems to be an odd alien that eats abstract emotions and memories.
</li></ul></li><li> Hera as a kind, merciful goddess, Zeus as a wise and good-natured god, although this is within the parameters of how ancient Greeks saw them. More glaring is that Ares, who according to Greek mythology was the Amazons' ancestor and one of the gods they supposedly worshiped most, is their inveterate enemy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em>. The 52niverse, however, follows Greek mythology a lot more closely (in personality, if not in form).
</li><li> One of the most amusing alterations for Wonder Woman is that the mythological Amazons were purported to be the <em>inventors of pants</em> and were nearly always depicted wearing them, while the Amazons of DC dress in Greek inspired togas and other leg baring fashions, despite the Greeks always depicting them as semi barbaric foreigners.
</li><li> Of particular note Ares' relationship to Hippolyta. In the original myths he was her father but the comics are inconsistant about her parentage. This is particularly squicky in comic versions where he has a thing for Hippolyta, especially since he was one of the few Olympians who was usually a decent parent in the myths and the comics.
</li><li> The Nemesis Wondy faces in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanOdyssey">Wonder Woman: Odyssey</a></em> claims to be driven mad by her duty to get revenge for the wrongful/murdered dead. Mythological Nemeses deal out suffering to those who she considered to have too much happiness and good fortune in their lives, as a direct counter to Tyche (the goddess of fortune). She <em>could</em> be called on for revenge, but by jilted lovers not murder victims.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011">Wonder Woman (2011)</a></em> a big deal is made of a prophecy about one of Zeus' children taking over Olympus and it turns out to be the "First Born", however in the original mythology (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Wonder Woman (1987)</a></em>) it was <em>Athena</em> who was prophesised to usurp Zeus, which is why he tired to kill her while her mother was still pregnant with her by eating her mother. All the driving questions about who the prophecy is reffering to would not have worked if the tale had stuck closer to its mythological roots in reguards to Olympus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth">Wonder Woman (Rebirth)</a></em> introduces Aphrodite and Hermes' child Atlantiades/Hermaphroditus, however it turns him into the child of Aphrodite alone while still claiming his name Atlantiades comes from being Atlas' great-grandson despite Hermes being the one of his parents decended from Atlas due to G. Willow Wilson mistaking Aphrodite's mother Dione from those few mythological sources that claim Zeus as Aphrodite's father as a different Dione from mythology who was Atlas' daughter.
</li></ul></li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, Loki is making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>, and he references his children but claims that Fenrir is called "Sun-Eater". In Norse myth, Fenrir is destined to kill Odin at Ragnarok. His <em>son</em> Skoll is the one that eats the sun (his other son, Hati, eats the moon). Might be slightly justifiable: fathers are notorious for constantly mashing their children's birthdays, hobbies and friends together and getting the wrong answers without a bit of help via being given the stink-eye to keep things straight. And, in Loki's defense: he had a lot of children as both Dad <em>and</em> Mom: must be a bit hard to keep track...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> versions of Ares and Achilles both mention fighting side by side at Troy. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad">The Iliad</a></em> Ares was in the Trojan camp.
</li><li> Averted, though it's not obvious at first, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>. Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias's mutant pet lynx is named Bubastis, presumably after the Egyptian goddess Bast. It's frequently assumed to be this trope, as Bast was the goddess and Bubastis was the name of the city sacred to her, but Veidt largely frames his Egyptian references through a Greek context, and the Greeks used the same name for the goddess as the city&mdash;much as Ozymandias itself is the Greek name for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RamsesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RamsesII">Ramses The Great</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorWhoTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorWhoTitan">Doctor Who (Titan)</a></em> story "The Swords of Kali" falls squarely into the British imperialistic "Kali is the Hindu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> whose followers were all Thugee" misconception.
</li><li> As in the TV series (see below) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> comics features a speedster who took the name Savitar, because somebody skimmed the bit in Savitr's Wikipedia page which says "he is lord of that which is mobile and is stationary", and concluded this solar deity was the "god of speed". More egregious, however, because unlike the TV Savitar, the comics version is implied to actually be Hindu.

Hippolyta was his actual daughter with said queen and, like all his children, under his fierce protection should she ask for it. She was not someone he'd have attacked and raped as in the film, especially since Ares is one of the few in the Greek pantheon who doesn't have any famous tales of non-consensual relationships and is the only one who has done anything to prevent a rape, namely killing one of Posideon's sons for trying to rape one of Ares' daughters.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a></em>:
<ul><li> The movie refers to Loki as the Norse "god of darkness". Loki is not a god of darkness; the closest thing to a god of darkness in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> is N&oacute;tt, the personification of the night. Loki, is both a Jotun (the Norse giants) and a god, being listed as one of the Aesir in the Gylfaginning. He is one of mythology's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">trickster</a> gods; he plays an incredibly crucial role in the myths. (Granted, a lot of problems he solved, he caused.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfTheMask">Son of the Mask</a></em>, Loki is Odin's son (in the Norse myths, he's actually a Jotun fostered by the Aesir, of which Odin is the foremost). And the creators apparently didn't even bother to research the series' own "mythology", presenting Loki and the Mask as separate entities, while the original film established that Loki was trapped within the Mask.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans1981">Clash of the Titans</a></em> (the original):
<ul><li> The film makes so much hash of its source material that an exhaustive catalog of the errors would be a challenge. Considering that the errors begin, in a way, with the title of the film, this should not be too surprising: the film considers a <em>Titan</em> to be just about any large, disagreeable monster such as the Kraken (which is Scandinavian, anyway; the creature depicted by the movie is actually supposed to be Cetus) or Medusa, while in Greek mythology the Titans were an early group of immortals before the Greek gods (who overthrew them). The main storyline follows the main events of the Perseus myth, but also muddles together unrelated stories, such as Pegasus, as well as nonsensical elements that appear nowhere in any of the cobbled-together myths, such as a mechanical owl.
</li><li> The inclusion of Pegasus is especially ironic given that that the original winged horse sprang from Medusa's remains.
</li><li> Ray Harryhausen even acknowledged the fact that the Kraken never appeared in Greek mythology. Cetus, the sea monster that Perseus killed in the myth, was more akin to a sea dragon. Ray simply didn't want to create another dragon, so he decided to use the Kraken, a far more unique menace. It was purely an aesthetic decision, although it doesn't at all resemble a squid or octopus like the mythological Kraken.

<ul><li> Hades as the evil "God of Hell," who is trying to (you guessed it) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>.
</li><li> Not to mention that Medusa's lair is apparently in/near the Underworld, Perseus hated all the gods, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he ends up with the wrong girl</span>, and Pegasus isn't the unique child of a very unique mother, but rather a name for winged horses in general.

Their depiction of Cerberus is especially bad, what with it guarding a <em>Hun</em> weapon in <em>Romania</em> instead of the gates of a <em>Greek</em> underworld, and everything...
</li><li> Kali:
<ul><li> Almost any Western movie ever, when it comes to <em>Kali</em>, the Hindu Goddess of death, destruction and disease, but also of mercy and forgiveness and good health. More on her on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali">That Other Wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></em>? Check. <em>Stranglers of Bombay</em>? Check. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenVoyageOfSinbad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoldenVoyageOfSinbad">The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</a></em> (animated Kali by Ray Harryhausen)... Check. Probably the earliest example in film would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GungaDin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GungaDin">Gunga Din</a></em>, a direct inspiration for at least some of the aforementioned. Shiva raises more confusion, maybe because theoretically he's the most capable of destruction, but very rarely cares to blast anything, when compared with other deities.
</li><li> To oversimplify the issue, Durga fought demons so strong she has to be reborn in the form specifically prepared for this task, while Kali slaughtered lesser foes. Kali is also a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.festivalsinindia.net/goddesses/kali.html">mother figure<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &mdash; which makes her sort of "universal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">Mama Bear</a>," but then it's only <em>to be expected</em> that she can be utterly horrifying <em>and</em> widely admired.
</li><li> Mostly, these confusions arose because Hinduism itself (as most Europeans know it) is a result of several transformations. First was Vedanta introduced in the 8th century AD, last was the "Hindu Reformation" of the 19th to early 20th centuries. For one of the <em>local</em> interpretations, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">a guy who grew up there and spoke their language</a> and his <em>Shiv and the Grasshopper</em>, where neither Shiv nor Parbati are portrayed as anything anywhere near "gods of destruction," but "Shiva the Preserver" was invoked. BTW, he's blue-necked because he drank primal poison capable of wiping out the rest of the universe. But if you see Trimurti as a personification of Guna (3 flavors of prime driving force), it makes sense that the face of Tamas is a pinnacle of the body's force ("food giver," Great Ascetic, creator of dance) and raw force as such (ultimately not-to-be-trifled-with but not very <em>actively</em> dangerous power, both "Destroyer" and "Preserver" depending on the situation)... and, well, have such an outstanding "significant other."
</li><li> The villains in the <em>Temple of Doom</em> were Thugee (although highly distorted ones, no Thug would be stupid enough to act openly), and at least some of the real members of the group claimed to worship Kali as death. The problem is, the movie treats this as being the correct and only interpretation of Kali, who is actively evil and makes people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> with her blood.
</li><li> For further mythtaken-ness, <em>The Temple of Doom</em> has Shiva as the one true God of Hinduism and Kali as his enemy.
</li><li> What may confuse people more is that there is an entirely different figure in Hindu mythology named Kali, who actually <em>is</em> evil. It doesn't help that Indian civilization goes back a <em>really</em> long way, and people there commonly name their kids after gods, and they have quite a lot of kids and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">quite a lot of gods</a>.
</li><li> The killer Kali statue from <em>Golden Voyage of Sinbad</em> may be an in-character example, as the evil wizard who controlled it showed few signs of <em>being</em> Hindu, although he did recognize what goddess the statue represented. Animating the thing was just a convenient way for him to impress the local savages and create a many-sword-wielding Mook. The green-painted savages who worshiped the statue weren't intended to be typical of Kali-worshipers either; they're just a Stone Age tribe that'd moved into the ruins and adopted the statue as a deity because it looked impressive.

<ul><li> The plot-driver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArkOfTheCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArkOfTheCovenant">The Ark of the Covenant</a> is some sort of magical weapon, and would make its owner invincible. In fact, one instance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfSamuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BooksOfSamuel">in 1 Samuel</a> where the Israelites tried to use it as a weapon merely caused the Ark to get <em>very angry</em> at their disrespect and let them lose the battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Given the Ark simply wiped out the Nazis who opened it, though, perhaps the part of retaliating against its owners was indeed noted.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></em>, the Sankara stones are depicted as rare artifacts, and are referred to as <em>The</em> Sankara Stones. In the film, there are only five. But these stones are lingams, which can be any stone dedicated to Shiva or meant to represent Shiva.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail">Holy Grail</a> as granter of eternal life" plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">The Last Crusade</a></em> is not based on the Bible or later Christian tradition either. The writers came with it after toying with the idea of having Indy retrieve the Holy Grail in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a>, <em>then</em> go to look for some version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">Fountain of Youth</a> in the movie proper. Somebody suggested to mix the two, and the rest is (movie) history.
</li><li> The Holy Grail itself, in this movie and many other movies and stories, is a prime example. First of all, the term "Holy Grail" originally referred to an object, not clearly defined, probably a bowl, but definitely not a cup, that was wholly (no pun intended) fictional, purely a literary device. At some point, it somehow became conflated with the Holy Chalice, the cup that Christ drank from at the Last Supper, which was offhandedly mentioned in the bible, but as nothing more or less than what it was: a cup. The Christian religion has no significant tradition regarding the Holy Chalice, merely saying that it is Holy by virtue of the fact that Christ handled it, so in the same sense that Christ's sandals could be called "The Holy Sandals".
</li><li> According to Christian tradition, there appears to be two Holy Grail legends. The first Grail legend states that it is the cup that Jesus used at the Last Supper to turn water and wine into his blood. The 2nd Grail legend states that the cup belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple, who was at the Crucifixion. When Longinus, a Roman centurion, pierced Jesus' side with his lance to make sure that he was dead, Joseph used the cup to catch the blood of Jesus in it as it rained down from above him.

And, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaMothraKingGhidorahGiantMonstersAllOutAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaMothraKingGhidorahGiantMonstersAllOutAttack">Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack!</a></em>, he's stated to be a juvenile Orochi that has been purified (somehow) and now protects Japan from evil. However, Ghidorah has only three heads whereas Orochi has eight. The film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explains that Ghidorah hasn't matured enough to grow all of his heads back.</a> Averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMechagodzilla">Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla</a></em> which actually does a fairly accurate representation of the Okinawa mythologies of the Shisa in regards with the daikaiju King Caesar.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyHopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>'s character mentions that Spaniards honor the Saints during the Holy Week of Seville by burning their effigies. He's probably confused with the Fallas of Valencia, a different city where effigies of celebrities and politicians are burned &mdash; nothing to do with religion. This character is shown to be a jerk, but he should know the name of the city he's visiting, and people were in fact burning some effigies in the streets of Seville for some reasons we Spaniards cannot even imagine.
</li><li> Another confusion happens in a second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise">Tom Cruise</a> movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnightAndDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KnightAndDay">Knight and Day</a></em> (which at least filmed a couple of scenes in Seville). Nope, San Ferm&iacute;n is not the national holiday of Spain or something like that. It's a local holiday in Pamplona only.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyTrilogy">The Mummy Trilogy</a></em>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999">first film</a> also has Imhotep being terrified of cats, due to the claim that they are the guardians of the underworld. The Duat (underworld) in the actual myths was guarded by monstrous serpents, and someone in Imhotep's position, having assisting in the murder of the Pharaoh, the living incarnation of the sun god Ra, was guilty of the single worst crime imaginable, and there was a punishment reserved specifically for people who had committed this particularly horrid type of blasphemy: to be tied with one's arms behind one's back in the underworld in a position designed to cause terrible pain while having a multi-headed serpent eternally breathe fire into your face.
<ul><li> Generally, the earthly punishment for such "evil" crimes would not be immortality and mummification in ancient Egypt. Part of the belief behind the ancient Egyptian afterlife was that your name and physical body needed be preserved as well. So greatest punishment to them was to be forgotten and your body destroyed. If you did make to the afterlife, you faced the judgement aka the famous heart-weighing picture with that weird animal ready to eat your soul if the scale tipped against the feather of Maat.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Book of the Dead" is not a physical book; it's a collection of death-related texts from tomb walls and coffins (and it's really called "The Book of Coming Forth By Day"). Plus, even if it were a single artifact, it wouldn't have been the codex-style "book" seen in the film, as that format wasn't used till the late Roman Empire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyReturns">The Mummy Returns</a></em> has Anubis as a "dark god". To make it even worse, someone was described as <em>selling his soul to Anubis</em>. Anubis carries <em>all</em> the souls of the dead to the underworld, but he isn't in possession of those souls, nor is there any equivalent of hell in the Egyptian afterlife (undeserving souls are simply fed to a monster; yes, it sounds awful, but think about this: it's not <em>eternal</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy2017">The Mummy (2017)</a></em> carries on this grand tradition. It makes sure that the Satan analogue is Set rather than Anubis, which is better but not good. Set was really more a god of the deserts and chaos than, as the film describes him, a god of the dead. Also, Set is a bit like Loki in that he was portrayed more as mischievous in early myths, only crossing over to "evil" after he became associated with certain foreign tribes known for perennially invading Egypt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Xanadu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Xanadu">Xanadu</a></em> has Hera and Zeus claim that, as gods, they are above emotions. Yes, the god who would hit anything with a vagina (and Ganymede) and the goddess whose vengeance for being cuckolded would make Lorena Bobbitt cringe claim to be emotionless.
</li><li> Name a Mesoamerican god. <em>Quetzalcoatl</em>. Name that only one thing you know about Mesoamerican religions. <em>They practiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a></em>. So that's it! You'll place the climax of your movie on a scene featuring a human sacrifice to Quetzalcoatl! Except that's just <em>wrong</em>. Quetzalcoatl did not demand human sacrifice. He allegedly disliked it, and was "fed" on birds and butterflies only. Better candidates for your classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a> scene would be the god of war Huitzilopochtli or the god of water, Tlaloc. A lot of movies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apocalypto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apocalypto">Apocalypto</a></em> and other media botch this (notice <em>Apocalypto</em> takes place in Mayan lands, and Quetzalcoatl is thus referenced by his Mayan name, Kukulkan). More than that, Aztec priests took the names of their gods, and one named Quetzalcoatl tried to end the human sacrifice. He was executed as a heretic for this, naturally. Oddly enough, authentic depictions of Quetzalcoatl devouring humans have indeed been discovered, some of them rather early. No way of knowing whether such depictions were revisionist attempts to bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">ole' Quetzal</a> more in line with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">rest of the team</a>, or whether the gentle, tortilla-eating version of Quetzalcoatl was invented by Aztec subjects who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible">didn't actually LIKE being sacrificed.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em>: Admirably, instead of choosing a pagan god to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus">turn into a demon</a>, they used an actual evil spirit from Mesopotamian mythology as the one who possesses Regan. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazuzu">Pazuzu<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was the exact wrong choice, since out of all Mesopotamian demons, he's the only one known to <em>protect</em> children (mostly against his wife, Lamashtu, who would have been a more appropriate choice). It's possible, of course, that this would have been deliberate on the part of the author, if he wished to tap into the common belief among some Christians that the various pagan deities might actually have existed, but were actually demonic deceivers. In that case, the 'protects children' itself would have been a deceit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em> features muses, and an angel named Loki, but since in the <em>Dogma</em>-verse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">humans can imagine anything about cosmology and it becomes true</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Immortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Immortals">Immortals</a></em> takes a lot of liberties with Greek mythology.
<ul><li> Mixing up Heracles with Hephaestus, among so many other things.
</li><li> The movie tries to make Zeus out to be NICE GUY (well, he was a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>, but still nowhere near the original).

</li><li> The Titans are the losers in a war against those who would become known as gods instead of the gods' parents and grandparents. Tartarus is also now a mountain that imprisons them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a>,</em> the symbol they keep referring to as "The Eye of Ra" is actually "The Eye of Horus" and is also known as the "Wedjet".
</li><li> There's a brief but oft-quoted speech in the inspirational sports movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberTheTitans">Remember the Titans</a></em> where the coach of the titular football team encourages his players to aspire to be like their mythical namesakes, who were "greater even than the gods". He apparently forgot the part about the Titans being the fallen <em>predecessors</em> of the Gods. And the part where the leader of the Titans, Kronos, was defeated and imprisoned by his son after trying to cannibalize his own children.
</li><li> The story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jack and the Olympians: Lightning Thief</a></em> centers around a summer solstice deadline, but Persephone is shown living in the underworld with Hades&mdash;something that's supposed to happen during the fall and winter months. What makes it stand out more is that she <em>does</em> acknowledge that she gets time away from Hades... though exactly <em>when</em> that is never expanded on. Part of why this is especially aggravating is because in the book the movie claims to be based on this problem doesn't exist. Percy takes notice that Persephone's throne in the underworld is empty.
<ul><li> Also the movie adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">Everybody Hates Hades</a> where in the books that trope is subverted, Hades may not be the friendliest dude, and can be kind of harsh, but fair and generally true to his word. In the original mythology Hades was actually the <em>nicest</em> god in the entire pantheon apart from Hestia.
</li><li> Not only that but the movie mentions that not only does Persephone hate Hades, but she has so many affairs that she had to come up with a way to get her lovers out without Hades finding out. Neither Hades nor Persephone <em>ever</em> had an affair in the original mythology (The story of Adonis actaully features her as a mother figure rather than a lover, and Minthe and Leuce didn't exist in Greek Mythology all three stories are also <em>Roman</em> inventions) but Persephone is occasionally mentioned to prefer the company of Hades over that of <em>her own mother</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo">Wendigo</a> is identified as a Comanche myth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em>, but it is actually Algonquian, who were prominent in what is now the northern US and Canada, and the Atlantic coast - it's indicative of long winters and desperation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">Wonder Woman (2017)</a></em>: The film presents a very altered version of Greek myth, which is usual for WW though the film took some liberties that are not common for WW. Some of the most notable departures include:
<ul><li> Amazons in Greek myth are not peaceful enemies of Ares nor daughters of Zeus. They are warlike and barbaric daughters of Ares.
</li><li> Zeus was not a creator-god.
</li><li> Ares did not kill all the other Greek gods. Zeus was mightier than all the other Greek gods combined, and Ares was a particularly ill-favored god among the Greeks, causing him to often get embarrassed or defeated in their myths. In fact, the story given in the movie, Ares killing his father and the other divine predecessors to make way for a new pantheon is a lot more like Zeus' own rise to power against the Titans.
</li><li> Ares was also one of two gods of warnote : for the Greeks, he represented physical strength, valour, anger, and violence, far from the scheming planner of the film, though Ares taking on the scheming bits of Mars is common in Wonder Woman tales.
</li><li> Humankind was created by Prometheus, who later tricked Zeus into accepting bones and fat from animal sacrifice so that humans would be able to keep the meat, and stole fire from Zeus on humankind's behalf. Zeus was actually behind the plan to release evil upon humankind with the whole Pandora thing, rather than being the beneficent father-creator god described by Hippolyta.
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous creature in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGorgon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGorgon">The Gorgon</a></em> is identified as Megaera, one of the sisters of Medusa. The film takes liberties about the myth in this regard, since Medusa's sisters are actually called Stheno and Euryale in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, and Megaera is the name of one of the three Furies.
</li><li> That bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnWick">John Wick</a></em> about John's name being "Baba Yaga". It's translated as "boogeyman", which technically isn't too far off the mark, as Baba Yaga has been used to scare children into behaving... but since she's also an elderly female witch with iron teeth who rides a giant mortar-and-pestle across the sky, something Keanu Reeves does not resemble at all, it's a puzzling choice for a nickname.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> movie mentions a creature from Native American mythology called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotamkin">Apotamkin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, claiming it is a type of vampire... except it is actually described as a gigantic, monstrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster">sea serpent</a> with long red hair that is said to live in Passamaquoddy Bay and eats anyone who wanders close to its domain, partcularly unsupervised children.

Comparatively, the honorable Aragorn is named Gwydion, who was actually more like Loki/Hermes in the mythology. At least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LloydAlexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LloydAlexander">Lloyd Alexander</a> admits he's playing fast and loose with the Welsh mythological canon. To quote him: "Prydain is not Wales&mdash;not entirely, at least.

(And for its next trick, the rules of the Universe are based on those of baseball).
</li><li> In Immanuel Velikovsky's supposedly nonfiction book <em>Worlds in Collision</em>, he put forth a pseudoscience explanation for various cataclysms based on the idea that Venus was the Roman version of the Greek Athena. In fact Venus is the Roman equivalent of Aphrodite, a fact that even bad pop song writers should be able to tell you.
</li><li> Early in his writing career, Robert E. Howard realized he was horrible at making up names. So the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Cimmerian</a> stories are liberally sprinkled with historical and mythical names for characters and places that don't necessarily relate to the narrative context. In some cases (particularly with the Aesir and the Vanir tribes) that what we know of ancient mythology is actually half-remembered tales of real events from the Hyborean Age. So in the Conan universe, we're <em>all</em> guilty of this trope.

</li><li> Herman Melville betrayed his (or his character's) ignorance of Greek mythology when, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em>, he had Captain Ahab compare the ship's blacksmith to Prometheus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a> (sort of) - and also, a straight comparison of a blacksmith to Hephaestus was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> at the time he was writing the novel. "Chapter 108: Ahab and the Carpenter: The Deck&#151;First Night Watch":
<div class="indent"><em>What's Prometheus about there? &mdash;the blacksmith, I mean &mdash;what's he about? He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now. Right. It's a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce red flame there! Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work. Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what's made in fire must properly belong to fire; and so hell's probable.</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHalloweenTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHalloweenTree">The Halloween Tree</a></em> features a downright painful mangling of mythology. It equates Osiris with Ra, as well as equating Osiris' resurrection with both the cycle of day and night and the changing of the seasons.
</li><li> One can forgive Dante's merging of Greek and Christian takes of the afterlife and mythology in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> as creative liberty, but one <em>cannot</em> forgive him for his use of the centaurs in the outer ring of the seventh circle of Hell, for one distinct reason: he put <em>Chiron</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Defector from Decadence</a> and revered <em>healer</em> and <em>sage</em>, as the <em>leader</em> of the centaurs driving the damned back into the boiling blood river, and put <em>Nessus</em>, known for <em>raping Hercules' second wife and tricking her into poisoning Hercules to death</em>, as the one the one who helps Dante and Virgil across the river. Apparently, all Dante ever knew about them was that they were both centaurs and Nessus carried someone across a river one time.
<ul><li> He also portrayed Cacus as a centaur and Geryon as a dragon, despite both of them being humanoid giants in the original mythology.
</li></ul></li><li> You can blame Lafcadio Hearn for the fact that any Westerner who's heard of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">mujina</a></em> probably has it confused with the <em>noppera-b&#333;</em> (or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank">faceless ghost</a>"), and for mislabeling the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian">nukekubi</a></em> as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">rokuro-kubi</a></em>.
</li><li> Bridget Wood's Celtic fantasy novels. But hey, it replaces all semblance of plot with bestiality and gory rape, so that's all right then.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some criticisms actually have <em>the criticizers</em> run afoul of this just as much as Stephenie Meyer did. No, Vampires did <em>not</em> sparkle, but has anyone (who hasn't played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BenJordanParanormalInvestigator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BenJordanParanormalInvestigator">Ben Jordan</a>) who says vampires couldn't go out into the daylight ever heard of a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigoi">Strigoi<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>? Or even <em>read</em> the Bram Stoker novel? Not to mention, some of the werewolf myths actually <em>were</em> just men who shifted into wolves.
</li><li> In <em>Twilight</em>, Meyer describes varacolaci as being "a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human", while they are more famously known as wolf demons that cause solar and lunar eclipses by swallowing the sun and moon respectively. They also appear as <em>dry</em> pale-skinned humans, not beautiful. In <em>Breaking Dawn</em> and <em>Midnight Sun</em>, Meyer cites the incubus and succubus as vampires who are known in mythology as being promiscuous and seduced women and men, respectively. Both of them were demons who were believed to be the cause of nightmares and wet dreams. Also in <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the cleaning lady at Bella and Edward's honeymoon site believes that Edward is a "libishomen", described as "a blood-drinking demon who preys exclusively on beautiful women". In reality, lobishomen (the real name of the libishomen in mythology) were monkey-like werewolves. One of those is actually justified; Edward implied that myths about incubi were made up by humans based on vampires like him. The other cases are valid, though, and there was also a mention of 'actual' werewolves that operate on 'full moon and silver bullets' logic. The silver bullets are more of a Hollywood concept.
</li></ul></li><li> Related to the above, the fandom of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em>, rather than the author, are widely guilty of this. Adaptations have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> sunlight into vampire kryptonite, but Mythology <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Marches On</a>, and Stoker's vampires are merely weaker in sunlight. The original Dracula is also destroyed by a knife through the heart rather than a stake. Sharp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">steel or iron objects like needles or knives</a> are effective vampire kryptonite in Slavic mythology, yet adaptations, sequels, and even "scholarly" annotated versions of the novel jump on the lack of a wooden stake as proof that Dracula is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>.
</li><li> The characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></em> use the idea of Atlas holding up the celestial sphere as a model of great men being constrained by the demands of lesser beings. If Atlas ever got tired of the weight, all he'd have to do is shrug it off and it'd be the end for them, right? Well, in the original myth, Atlas was holding up the <em>sky</em>, and he was doing so at the command of <em>the gods</em>, as punishment for siding with the Titans in the Titanomachy. For added giggles, this had the side effect of preventing Gaia from doing the nasty with Ouranos and creating more problems for the gods. Additionally, shrugging off the weight without someone else to hold it for him (like Heracles in one of the myths) would only result in Atlas and everyone getting the sky dropped on them. Ironically enough attempting to "Go Galt" and separate yourself from the rest of society in real life can have similar messy consequences since many of those other beings are responsible for ensuring that "great men" have nice things (Who Cleans Galt's John?). In any event, Atlas was eventually turned to stone by Perseus anyway, making the shrugging a moot point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> novels tend to attach the names of mythological creatures to beings unrelated to them. For example, "boggarts" are small, dwarf-like creatures, not shapeshifters. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example occurs when Snape says that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kappa">Kappa</a> is a Mongolian beast, not Japanese, in an offhand comment, correcting a student in one book. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">side book</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> states that Kappas are actually Japanese (as in real life), with a note from Harry in the margin stating "Snape hasn't read this book either".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush">Hush, Hush</a></em>, the characters constantly turn to the Book of Enoch as a reference for the rules of fallen angels. This is reinforced by the fact that the only fallen angels we see are ones who procreated with humans to create the Nephilim (as recorded in the Book of Enoch). According to the book though, the angels did not fall because of lust for human women, but because they were supposed to watch over the Garden of Eden and instead tempted Eve with the apple so that they could lay claim to Earth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We later find out that the fallen angels get shots at both becoming a guardian angel (saving a human life) or becoming a human (killing a Nephilim), the latter situation allegedly having been recorded in the Book of Enoch. There is no such story there, and in fact the Book makes it very clear that the fallen angels have absolutely no chance of redemption at all</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatyricon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatyricon">The Satyricon</a></em>, Trimalchio narrates a skit about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">the Trojan War</a> to his dinner guests and completely butchers the mythology. This was a satire of nouveau riche merchants, whereas proper aristocratic Romans would've received an education in Greek literature and philosophy.
</li><li> Lampshaded and deconstructed in Simon Green's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightside">Razor Eddie's Big Night Out</a>", in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s fish-demon conception of the god Dagon has become so well-known in pop culture that the <em>original</em> Dagon, a human-looking, inoffensive agricultural deity, is being pushed out of the Street of the Gods as a result. Luckily for the original, Razor Eddie is a friend of his, and he's <em>not</em> fond of poseurs....
</li><li> In the short story "The All Ireland Champion Versus the Nye Add", found in <em>The Ribbajack,</em> champion fisherman Roddy Mooney sets his sights on catching a Nye Add, which, according to him, is half woman and half fish. Said Nye Add reveals to the narrator at the end of the story that she is actually a kelpie. The problem is that Nye Adds (naiads) are <em>not</em> interchangeable with mermaids; they look exactly like human women and do not have fish tails; neither do real kelpies for that matter, which are water horses from Celtic mythology that lure children onto their backs to drown and eat them. Not to mention that naiads are from <em>Greek,</em> not Irish, mythology.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a> had used "Alicorn" to refer to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedUnicorn">Winged Unicorn</a> &mdash; Alicorn is actually the substance a unicorn horn is made out of. However, he wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">the most popular one</a> to use it (see below).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em>, Sister Mary Angela, the Head Nun of the Benedictine Abbey, calls Kalona a Nephilim. A Catholic Nun would know better than that, and that the Raven Mockers, which are beings that are part-Immortal/part-Human, are in fact Nephilim. Kalona even named his eldest son after a type of Nephilim.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGospelOfLoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGospelOfLoki">The Gospel of Loki</a></em>, Joanne Harris offers her own spin on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>. Harris clearly knows her source material very well, and sticks very closely to the recorded mythology. However, she does occasionally change things:
<ul><li> The idea that reversing or flipping a rune changes its meaning stems from the late 18th century Armenian Futhark runes, not the historical Germanic/Scandinavian runes.
</li><li> The "bastard" rune on Maddie's hand is supposed to be the Aesc/Aesk ("ash tree") rune; however, the rune illustrated in-story is not Aesc, but &Oacute;s (the historical Anglo-Saxon "god" rune). The real-life Aesc/Aesk rune is identical in appearance to the Elder Futhark Ansuz rune. (Long story short, the "broken" &Oacute;s rune took Ansuz's place as the "god" rune in Anglo-Saxon lore, while Ansuz was renamed Aesc/Aesk and was moved further down the aett list.)
</li><li> <em>Dagaz</em>, the rune of "day" is somehow associated with the thunderbolt, when it is actually the rune of transformations and new beginnings.
</li><li> <em>Iar</em> is affiliated with the world serpent (its stanza mentions rivers while the name "Iar" is Old English for eel, a common kenning for the World Serpent) and boundaries, not industry and building.
</li><li> <em>Berkana</em> is the rune of the birch tree and nurturing/fertility, not revelation. <em>Kaen</em>, on the other hand, <em>is</em> the rune of insight and revelation as well as creative fire (it is the "torch" rune), not wildfire or Loki.
</li><li> Thurisaz is not the rune of victory: that title belongs to the Tiwaz/Tyr rune. Historically, Thurisaz is the rune of destruction, misery, and the J&ouml;tnar, and was often used to curse on one's enemies. Its association with Thor started with the Armenian runes, stemming mainly from it being vaguely-hammer-shaped, and it being the first letter of Thor's name.
</li><li> Sleipnir is a strawberry roan, even though <em>Gylfaginning</em> describes him as grey.
</li><li> Odin's son Vidar has been left out of the book, but his epithet "The Silent God" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNickname">ironically</a> applied to Odin's brother Honir. Vidar was also supposed to kill Fenrir, but in the book Thor does it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Domina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Domina">Domina</a></em>: In-universe. Since all the cultures are real gangs based on myths, things get weird pretty quickly. The first vampire was Striga (which is a Romanian word that can mean a vampire, but is more commonly a type of witch), the giants of Niflheim and Muspelheim are on friendly terms (in Norse mythology they spent nearly as much time killing each other as the gods), trolls are color-coded giants with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">though no one can agree on what trolls should be anyway</a>), and the angels have six Names after the archangels&mdash;Gabriel, Jegudiel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, and Lucifer (Lucifer was a title, the correct name would be Samael). Some of these are lampshaded in the text, but most are ignored, since the cultures have been going on for long enough that the locals remember them far more clearly than ancient myths.
</li><li> <strong>The peryton</strong>. This stag-headed, bird-bodied monster that casts a human shadow and consumes human hearts appears in countless fantasy and mythology series, which will tell you it originated from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>. The truth? It was an invention of Argentinean writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JorgeLuisBorges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> for his book of mythical creatures <em>The Book of Imaginary Beings</em>. His fondness of scholarly humour inspired him to create a "mythical" mythical creature, with another infamous example being the A Bao A Qu, a formless entity which he claimed was from Indian mythology.
</li><li> <em>The Song Of Hiawatha</em> was an epic poem that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow composed by mashing together several Native American legends, myths, and actual historical events into a single narrative. The basic story was about all he got right.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOfTheExiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOfTheExiles">Saga of the Exiles</a></em> plays it similarly to the Conan example. Celtic mythology turns out to be the barely-remembered accounts of things that actually happened in the Pliocene epoch involving aliens and time travellers, thus making everyone in the real world fall into this trope.

<ul><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> was arguably already pushing the "liberal" application of Egyptian mythology too far, the series pushed it even further &mdash; and not just Egyptian, but many mythologies all over the world, shoehorning them into the premise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">aliens impersonating gods</a>. Of course, within its universe, it's the religions that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic mutations</a> of the events that "really" happened, not the other way round.
</li><li> Even there it's a little unclear. Sometimes the Goa'uld seemed to be impersonating or taking on the roles of mythological figures that existed before those Goa'uld came to Earth, while other times the Goa'uld seemed to be using their own names and identities which happened to inspire the myths we now know. That might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, or since the Goa'uld came to Earth now and then for thousands of years, it might just vary depending on the individual Goa'uld. The Asgard, though, unambiguously are open about their names, identities and goals, and their actions happened to inspire the Norse myths.
</li><li> The Asgard used holoprojectors to disguise that they were small and grey, though. <em>SG-1</em>'s position on the Goa'uld seems to have shifted over time. It was pretty clearly a case of the Goa'uld being the inspiration for mythology, but characters started quite pointedly saying the Goa'uld <em>assumed</em> the roles of gods. (Presumably someone became uncomfortable with the unfortunate implications for well, every religion in the world).

The problem with this is that it was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedWeapons">named</a> Mjolnir, and is probably the second most famous named weapon in the West (a distant loss to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Excalibur">Excalibur</a>).

Eventually they learn that the stalker believes Sally to be the incarnation of an Egyptian goddess named Serena. Not only is the Egyptian mythos totally unrelated to Satanism, and "Serena" not an Egyptian goddess, but "Serena" isn't even an Egyptian name! It's related to Selena, which is <em>Greek</em>.

<ul><li> The Halloween episode is notorious among certain circles for portraying Janus as a god of chaos. Nothing could be further from the truth; while the "division of self" does fit the idea of people and their costumes becoming one, Janus could better be portrayed as a god of Order, not Chaos, especially in his role as god of portals, doors, and gateways.
</li><li> Another episode involved invoking Diana for a spell meant to make someone fall in love, or at least lust, with someone else. Part of her domain was virginity. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">this could be why the spell went so horribly wrong</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show started out with urban legends and was very faithful to them. It started doing the same kind of 'square peg into round hole' approach to its monsters-of-the-week as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> (ex. brain-eating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">kitsune</a>) around the same time it started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCosmic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCosmic">Going Cosmic</a> and incorporating all kinds of mythology, no matter how awkwardly they fit the series.
</li><li> One of the cryptids in the show was the Jersey Devil, who looked like a devil. This would have been fine, had not the Jersey Devil looked like a long-necked horse with bat wings.
</li><li> One of the most talked-about examples is the episode "Hammer of the Gods", in which all pagan deities are man-eaters. It's vaguely interpreted that gods feast on human flesh when there's little faith left to sustain them... in which case, it's surprising to hear that <em>all of India</em> embraced Islam at some point in the history of the Supernatural-verse. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says it's actually sacrifices that fuel the pagan gods, not faith, hence why Kali has been reduced to man-eating.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Archangel Gabriel</a> is strangely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a>. In fairness he's pretending to be Loki, but no traditional interpretation of Gabriel puts him anywhere near that personality.
</li><li> In the Halloween episode, they introduced a demon named Samhain as the origin of the holiday. That's bad enough, but what's unforgiveable is that they <em>pronounced it phonetically</em>. It wasn't an intentional sign of ignorance either. If Dean had pronounced it wrong it would be one thing, but Sam the research geek and the angels of the Lord also said it phonetically. In case anyone doesn't know, the correct pronounciation is "Sawin".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherOfAThousandYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherOfAThousandYoung">progenitor of all the monster races</a> is named Eve, who is a biblical character tempted into evil by a monster. The Greeks actually called this monster-mother Echidna.
</li><li> A season 8 episode mentions Prometheus as a love interest of the goddess Artemis, when Artemis was, among other things, the goddess of chastity. Of course the relationship between the two was treated as if it was a bit of a scandal so it could've been an intentional change.
</li><li> Sometimes the show does this intentionally. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that there's plenty of lore on unicorns even though hunters are <em>pretty</em> sure they're not real, angels were invincible when they first showed up because (in addition to genuinely being extremely powerful) they had destroyed all information on their weaknesses, and zombies have so much conflicting lore that it's hard to figure out what created a specific zombie or how to kill it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dean:</strong> You're telling me there's no lore on how to smoke 'em? <br><strong>Sam:</strong> No, Dean. I'm telling you there's too much. I mean, there's a hundred different legends on the walking dead, but they all have different methods for killing them. Some say setting them on fire, one said... where is it... right here: feeding their hearts to wild dogs. That's my personal favorite.

For those unfamiliar with Greek mythology, Aphrodite was the goddess of <em>love</em>, and sister to the God of war Aries. It should be noted that while Midge is certainly not very bright, the info is implied to have come from a speech she heard that evening rather than her own lack of intelligence, hence her even knowing the name Aphrodite. It's possible the mixup was with Athena, who while generally associated with wisdom is also the goddess of warfare in Greek mythos.

<ul><li> In the Hindu pantheon, there is a <em>Savitr</em>, but he's a solar god, and has nothing to do with speed or motion. Granted, Earth-1 <em>is</em> a world where metahumans have been around in one form or another since Ancient Egypt, so their myths may have evolved a bit differently.
</li><li> Also Savitar claims he sought godhood because God doesn't feel pain; though it is true that he doesn't feel physical pain,&nbsp; the Old Testament does include multiple passages where <strong>&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</strong>, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bdnj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4bdnj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bdnj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><strong>YHWH</strong>, Romanised <strong>JHVH</strong>; Pronounced: <strong>Yahweh</strong>, Romanised <strong>Jehovah</strong> (more commonly used pronunciation)</span> <em>(That's the name of the Abrahamic God)</em> states he's feeling emotional pain, which is what Savitar was referring to. It appears that even though he's been around for thousands of years, he has <strong>never once</strong> bothered to actually <em>read a Bible</em> or any other religions holy text either. Plus, Savitar has only referenced commonly known myths and hasn't shown any in-depth knowledge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinOfSherwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinOfSherwood">Robin of Sherwood</a></em> has Herne the Hunter as a powerful and possibly immortal shaman who is a core figure in English pagan spirituality. In actual folk tradition, he was only a not-very-powerful local ghost associated with the area around Windsor, and was either feared or despised rather than worshipped. There are no written records of the legend before it was used as a plot point by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerryWivesOfWindsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a></em>. <em>Robin</em> may have been influenced by earlier twentieth-century literary fantasies that treated him as more important, in particular John Masefield's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxOfDelights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxOfDelights">The Box Of Delights</a></em> and Susan Cooper's series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising">The Dark Is Rising</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLibrarians2014">The Librarians 2014</a></em> season four episode <em>The Steal of Fortune</em> states that Jupiter had a contest between his four favorites, Minerva, Mars, Saturn, and Fortuna to see who would rule over humanity. Fortuna is a minor goddess in Roman Mythology, and Saturn is the father Jupiter deposed. Neither would be considered his favorites, or a candidate for such a contest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer2016">Lucifer</a></em> at one point has a character make the claim that "every religion has a devil who was originally a fallen angel." This is roughly on the same level of accuracy as claiming that every religion is monotheistic. Many religions have no Satan analogue, and most of the ones that do (aside from Christianity and Islam) don't depict that being as having been cast from heaven- more commonly it's just an outside antagonist.

<ul><li> <em><strong>The Bible</strong></em>
<ul><li> "Apocalypse:"
<ul><li> An "apocalypse" is simply knowledge acquired, or a "revelation" if roughly translated. But nowadays we also use it to mean "the end of the world", thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Book of Revelation</a>, which was all about an "apocalypse" (i.e. a revelation) <em>regarding</em> the end of the world. Any story in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic</a> setting where the Book of Revelation stuff has already happened is sadly mythtaken.
</li><li> On that note, "Armageddon" properly refers to the <em>place</em> of a battle during the end of the world, not to the end of the world itself. The name means Mount Megiddo, a place in Israel inhabited from 7000 BC to 586 BC, with the area resettled by a kibbutz in 1949 AD.
</li><li> Similar to Armageddon, Azazel is often depicted as a living being in a lot of media, including religious texts such as Enoch which describes "him" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">fallen angel</a>. However Leviticus makes it clear that, Azazel is a place, an <em>Earthly</em> place where Hebrews set captive goats free. This is one of the reasons in Enoch is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">apocryphal book</a>. But you know, fallen angels are supposedly more interesting than goat havens, so everyone goes with Enoch's version or something similar instead.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a> consumed by Adam and Eve in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a> is often portrayed as an apple. This had to do with the story being translated to Latin, where the word for the noun "evil" (<em>malum</em>) was similar to the word for "apple" (<em>m&#257;lum</em>). Thus the apple was a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a>. Unless the people who came up with the original story had contact with people from in or around modern-day Kazakhstan, it's unlikely that they would have even known what an apple <em>was</em>. Theories for what the fruit originally was include figs, grapes, pomegranates, dates, and even wheat, all much more familiar to the people of the Fertile Crescent. (Not that it really matters, however, as the <em>type</em> of fruit is not the point; the point is that there was a command to not do something (in this case, eat the fruit of a particular plant), and that command was disobeyed, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">chaos</a>.
</li><li> Any depiction of a cherub or other angel as a winged baby. Said winged babies are more accurately called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putto">putti<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and have no relevance to angels, but some how got consolidated and confused with cherubim. Said cherubim are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">rather monstrous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">in form</a>, with four faces, of an ox, a lion, a man and an eagle, four wings, and with many eyes covering its body, in and out. and one was given a flaming sword to guard the Garden of Eden with, which would be rather humorous if it really were a winged baby.
</li><li> The depiction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiblicalBadGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiblicalBadGuy">Jezebel</a> as a prostitute. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickAndLoadMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickAndLoadMontage">put on her makeup and finery</a> before facing Jehu in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">Face Death with Dignity</a>, not because she was trying to seduce him. She never actually engages in prostitution in the text; the confusion may stem from not only her putting on makeup and appearing in front of a large window, but also the fact that the pagan religion she was trying to promote sometimes involved ritual prostitution in the name of certain fertility gods such as Ba'al and Asherah. She may also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">getting confused with</a> a cult leader/another wannabe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPriest">High Priestess</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfRevelation">Book of Revelation</a>, even though the two are distinct characters. (Indeed, the Jezebel from <em>that</em> story may herself be getting confused with the Whore of Babylon.)
</li><li> Mary Magdalene's portrayal as a former prostitute is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a>, going back to a sermon by Pope Gregory I conflating her with two other Biblical characters, Mary of Bethany (sister of Lazarus) and an unnamed "sinful woman" who anointed Jesus's feet. In the canonical gospels she was possessed by seven demons, and she was one of the first to witness to Jesus's resurrection, and that's about all we're told about her.

So, to make the legends respectable, he claimed that the Norse Gods were actually <em>the heroes of the Iliad</em>, who came north after the events described by Homer, and, because the Greeks were so great, they were able to convince the locals that they were gods. In one of the most hilarious trees in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Forest,</a> he claims that because Thor was sometimes referred to as Asa-Thor ("The <strike>Aesir</strike>&Aacute;s, Thor"), that he was clearly Hec-Tor (never mind that Hector dies near the end of the Iliad). Okay, half the countries of Europe were claiming descent from some hero or race of Greek Myth at that time - the Britons claimed to be descended from someone called Brutus who, after the Trojan War, got swept out to sea and ended up in Britain; The Declaration of Arbroath says the Scots were descended from the Scythians (we can only presume because Kenneth MacAlpine played the same "Invite the chieftains to a party, get them drunk, then slaughter them" trick on the Picts that was played on the Scythians in Herodotus: there's very little other mention of the Scythians). So why not claim you're descended from every single Greek hero? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByJesus">He also was under a little pressure to point out that recording pagan myths didn't make him any less of a God-fearing Christian.</a> Texts such as the Lebor Gabala Erenn are essentially the Celtic (mainly Irish) equivalent of the Eddas; and also have a rather incoherent Christian time line tacked on. Interestingly, the author of the Book of Leinster was so afraid of being branded a heretic after listing the Tuatha De Danann that he added the disclaimer "Although the author enumerates them, he does not worship them."
</li><li> Norse myths continued to suffer: In Victorian times, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PoeticEdda">Poetic Edda</a></em> &mdash; an ancient collection of the Norse heroic legend &mdash; was re-discovered. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a> made them into operas, threw in some German myths, and we get the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DerRingDesNibelungen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DerRingDesNibelungen">Ring</a></em> cycle, which...well, it resembles the originals in places, but it's essentially a complete rewrite of the myths. And Wagner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to the Ring cycle, <em>Parsifal</em>, is the myth of the Holy Grail remade in the image of the Bayreuth Theater. At least Wagner didn't invent the sadly mythtaken Arabic etymology of Parsifal's name. Wagner's Ring is something of a cross between two versions of the same story, and Wagner's own personal sensibilities (the stories being the Middle High German <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a></em> and the Scandinavian <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VolsungaSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VolsungaSaga">V&ouml;lsunga saga</a></em>). It is very likely that the two stories share a common origin. Both purportedly feature the Burgundian realm by the Rhine and feature Attila as a minor character (Etzel in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nibelungenlied">Nibelungenlied</a></em>, Atle in the Scandinavian version).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Anubis:</a>
<ul><li> Pick any media where he appears. The mistaken uses of Anubis as evil, tremendously powerful, or the chief god of death in the Egyptian pantheon are so rampant and constant that they qualify as perhaps one of the most egregious examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a> in current culture. To be specific: Anubis <em>was</em> the <em>guardian</em> of the resting places of the dead, and the judge of dead souls. These were his only roles, making him a minor deity in the everyday life of the Egyptians, but more important when it came to death, which the Egyptians were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">morbidly</a> obsessed with - hence he appears all over their tombs and therefore has become very recognizable. The chief deity of the dead was Osiris, and <em>nothing</em> to do with death was inherently <em>evil</em>. In actuality, given his role as guardian Anubis could be considered one of the more benevolent deities of the Egyptian pantheon, so long as you don't mess with his charges.
</li><li> An interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> was <em>Disney's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> cartoon. Anubis makes an appearance, and has to repeatedly point out that he isn't good <em>or</em> evil. He does what he does, which was, in the <em>Gargoyles</em> universe, wielding power over who lives and who dies, but that power was applied indiscriminately. Though surprising for a Disney cartoon aimed more or less at younger viewers, it wasn't all that odd for <em>Gargoyles</em> to try and make a point like death isn't inherently good or evil.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> where Anubis is presented as a minor deity who is simply guarding Osiris's realm as he waited for Osiris's return.
</li><li> While there's no excuse for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight">the movie</a>, the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> comic had a fairly accurate portrayal of Anubis' trial of Ma'at, though with the original character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Shadi</a> in place of Anubis himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> averts this. Anubis appears as a minor god, and isn't so much as mentioned by name in the campaign. The Guardian Statue that appears briefly, bears some resemblance to him, and the protagonist's former archnemesis, who appears in two flashbacks, where he's killed, dressed like his followers, but that sums up all references made to him in the story. The god of the dead is Osiris, and he's on the heroes' side. The God of Evil who aids the villains is Set.
</li><li> Another interesting quasi-aversion is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. While the semi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascended</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Goa'uld</a> Anubis is in fact evil&mdash;indeed, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and a pretty scary one at that&mdash;Anubis is simply the worst of a bad bunch, all of whom pose as ancient gods, and all of whom are evil (except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">Tok'ra</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">rebels</a>, of course), regardless of the alignment of the mythological gods: Heru'ur, another antagonist, is a stand in for the unambiguously-good Horus; the same goes for Ba'al (who is unquestionably evil before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>). To the writers' credit, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist">Daniel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Jackson</a> occasionally try to remind us that the Anubis the Egyptians believed in was not evil.
</li><li> It's important to point out that Egyptian beliefs differed from nome to nome, and suffered MASSIVE retcons as time went by. Anubis was originally the God of the Underworld, but when the cult of Osiris (who was originally a water deity) rose to prominence, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> Anubis as the Embalmer. They did the same thing to Horus and Set, who were the guardians of Ra's solar barge, and turned them into Osiris' son and evil brother. Mythology marches on.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pharaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a></em>, where every god has fixed domains, regardless of the time period. Osiris is solely responsible for agriculture, and Anubis is only referenced as an add-on to the temple complex of Set, which reduces the quantity of linen required by embalmers. Set is no more or less likely that the other gods to turn on you, and when he does, he only attacks your military.
</li></ul></li><li> Just about every Western work with Kali (the Hindu night-goddess) in it. Mostly this is due to exaggerated stories about the Thuggee cult and general Western misunderstanding of Hindu deities. Several Hindu deities assume terrifying forms to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">slay demons.</a> One Hindu writer tried to explain this idea by saying that Kali can be like a cherished watchdog: to you, the dog will be cuddly and loving and a great friend, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">furious and dangerous to anyone they think might harm you.</a> Moreover, Kali's chopping off of heads symbolizes her chopping off bad thoughts and inflated egos, and her chopping off of hands symbolises her cutting off bad deeds. Strangely enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> has been doing their part to correct this misconception (albeit unintentionally) by crafting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> for the Punjabi wrestler "The Great Khali" in 2008 and having him fight Kane, who is literally known as "The Devil's Favorite Demon."
</li><li> While he is often treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddha</a> (a person who attained enlightenment), and sometimes as an incarnation of Maitreya, many depictions of Budai (also nicknamed the Laughing Buddha) usually by people with little to no knowledge of Buddhism, will treat him as THE Buddha, the deity Buddhists worship. In reality, the Buddha (Siddharta Gautama) is not worshiped as a deity at all, but rather revered for his wisdom and as an example of enlightenment. Some people do worship Buddha as a god. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Most don't claim to be Buddhist</a>.
</li><li> Modern depictions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> usually make the Titans a species of Giant. But in the original Greek myths the Titans are all gods, not Giants. Only in the last years of Classical antiquity did writers start getting them confused with the Giants, because both fought wars against the Olympian gods, and both were defeated. In fact some Greek gods, including some with significant worship such as Rhea and Hecate, were considered Titans who sided with Zeus in his war against the other Titans. The sun god Helios and moon goddess Selene are also Titans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology">Chinese</a>
<ul><li> The notion of "foo dogs" is a Western misconception, based on the mis-identification of Chinese guardian <em>lion</em> spirits' statues as canine. The existence of several Asian dog breeds that were named for, and bred to resemble, such divine leonine protectors has only exacerbated the misconception. This one actually goes both ways at once. Lions were an outside, 'exotic' animal in ancient China (read: no one actually knew what they looked like), known about mainly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology">other cultures'</a> mythic portrayals, so when depicting such creatures, Chinese artists would depict them using the features they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFormYouAreComfortableWith">would naturally associate</a> with such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">noble, majestic four-legged guardian.</a> (Besides, everyone knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">they're</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon">gerbils.</a>)
</li><li> Yin and Yang have been misinterpreted as just good versus evil or light versus darkness, when actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taoism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taoism">Taoism</a> teaches the importance of harmony in the world with the two sides of yin (examples of what it has represented are darkness/shadow, water, femininity, and calmness) and yang (which has represented fire/heat, light, aggression, and masculinity) working in concert rather than being at odds. One case of this is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a> where Raava and Vaatu are the spirits of light/peace and darkness/chaos who strongly invoke yin-yang symbolism (to the point of turning into the symbol in battle), with the two in ancient conflict that ends with Raava victorious.
</li><li> Not even the Chinese themselves are immune to this: nowadays, it is common to describe disastrous fires as "being visited by Zhurong", the ancient Chinese god of fire, despite that he is supposed to be a constructive, benevolent deity somewhere between Hestia and Prometheus.
</li></ul></li><li> Mesoamerican:
<ul><li> Whoever started the idea that the Maya calendar predicts an apocalypse in 2012 did not do the research. 2012 is the umpteenth anniversary of the creation of the universe in the Maya calendar, the end of one <em>bak'tun</em> (394.25 years) and beginning of the next one. It has nothing to do with the world ending. <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.24.com/jadedjayne/files/2012/02/7ac56b2e-3d62-40b9-802b-c027e148478b.jpg">The Maya calendar doesn't end in 2012<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> any more than the Western calendar ends in December 31st of every year.
</li><li> Aztec lore and mythology often gets this treatment as well, and the guy who gets the brunt of it is poor Quetzalcoatl. Many works of fiction have depicted Quetzalcoatl as an evil being, when in reality he is the most merciful and bloodless member of the entire pantheon. His sacrifice demands included such things as tortillas, butterflies, birds and snakes. One wonders why someone wouldn't just use one of their gods who actually <em>did</em> demand human sacrifice.
</li><li> The whole sacrifice angle seems to have put a black mark on the Aztec pantheon as a whole, but in their religion there was a very good reason for it. Without sacrifices, the gods would lose their strength. Without it, they would be unable to keep the tzitzimime, star daemons, from descending upon the world and tearing it apart. Then the whole Universe would go kaput. In their eyes, sacrifice was for a noble cause (The Aztecs were just far more enthusiastic about the number of people they sacrificed in contrast to their neighboring societies).
</li><li> Part of the misconceptions may also be due to the demonization and simplification of the gods by European invaders. Aztec deities were by no means "evil". All of them had good and bad traits. Even the gods of war and darkness governed vital aspects of the world that could be considered good, such as courage and the sun. The good gods have had their petty, jealous and occasionally cruel moments as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Any depiction of reincarnation as an advantage that allows you to come back to life and carry on with what you were doing. The driving point of Buddhism is that desires and attachments bring suffering, and by clinging to them you're doomed to come back to existence and continue to suffer; you're expected to rise above the worldly things and let go, thereby achieving Nirvana and <em>end</em> the cycle of reincarnation. To put it in different terms, reincarnation isn't an "extra life", it's you getting defeated by the end boss and having to start the game from the beginning again.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretatio_graeca">The ancient Greeks themselves were guilty of this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>- among others, they managed to identify the Egyptian Osiris (god of agriculture and the underworld) as, of all divinities, <em>Dionysus</em>.
<ul><li> Probably because they both got dismembered.
</li><li> Also likely related to Dionysus having agricultural associations, being the bringer of rains, which were far more important to Greek farming than river floods. And their only other notable agricultural deity being Demeter somewhat limited their options for comparison.
</li></ul></li><li> The Egyptians were one of the few civilizations to exist long enough to do this to <em>themselves</em> and leave written records behind of it having happened. The various Egyptian gods changed roles and relationships several times.
<ul><li> Ra might be the best known example: For example was the god of the sun as everybody knows. Except that eventually he ended up as the creator god associated with the sky, earth, and underworld. The animal he is associated with is the hawk, though sometimes it is the falcon. And then politics got involved and he turned into Amun-Ra (since Thebes conquered Egypt but figured they couldn't just make their patron god Amun into the new top god so they merged their god with the most popular god in Egypt). Then shortly after that he was officially declared to not exist (along with all the other gods) and replaced with Aten a god who <em>is</em> the sun. That state of affairs only lasted until the death of Akhenaten whereupon the Cult of Ra restored Amun-Ra.
</li><li> And of course one might assume that mixing up Ra and Horus because they both have birds for heads is a modern invention but it is <em>also</em> a confusion that the ancient Egyptians had. One of Ra's titles was "Horus of the Two Horizons".
</li></ul></li><li> Pop-culture accounts of Bigfoot are a present-day example, typically depicting the cryptid in question as ape-like, extremely elusive of humans, and animalistic in habit. The creature's appearance in Native American folklore is often cited as "evidence" that it really exists and has since ancient times ... even though the <em>original</em> stories of <em>ts'emekwes</em>, <em>stiyaha</em>, <em>skoocooms</em>, <em>s&aacute;sq'ets</em>, <em>Dzoonokwa</em> or <em>Slapu</em> generally depict them as intelligent, social beings who can speak human languages, use tools, weapons, and fire, and boldly raid villages for food, supplies, or women and children to eat and/or impress into their own bands.

How Perseus defeated Medusa was that he used a mirror (specifically his bronze shield polished to mirror sheen) to look at Medusa without being turned to stone, then used that to position himself for a killing blow. Modern works vary on this, often making it so that showing Medusa herself in a mirror would cause herself to turn into stone, which is suggested nowhere in ancient myths<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5njv3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5njv3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5njv3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A result of her myth getting mixed up with the legends of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice">basilisks</a>, which killed people by looking at them, and therefore died when shown a mirror.

Unless humans have claws, tails and udders. What is this trope however is the specific, common depiction of her as a multi-headed, multi-colored dragon that partially originated in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Some of this is because Tiamat of the Sumerians and later Babylonians is often conflated with the Ugaritic god Lotan (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, God defeats both of them).

</li><li> For example the writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em> had one Mesopotamian-mythology-themed episode in which Marduk fights against Tiamat&mdash;and Tiamat had the form of a five-headed dragon! It's unlikely (but conceivable) that this was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> reference as such; more likely, someone was familiar with the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> version of Tiamat and thought that the idea of Tiamat having five heads was authentically a part of the historical Mesopotamian version of the deity.
</li></ul></li><li> Bahamut:
<ul><li> Bahamut, the benevolent god of good dragons, is similarly named for the giant fish/whale/turtle (depends who you ask) of Arabian myth, which carries the world on its back. Think 'Behemoth'. Some people have also been getting angry at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> for spreading the image that Bahamut was a dragon. Lies. Bahamut's been listed as a benevolent dragon in Dungeons and dragons canon since the 70s - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> was just based off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>.</em>' A minor interesting note, though, is that some time ago, D&amp;D added a character named Kuyutha, Exarch of Bahamut (his champion of sorts), whose name is based on <em>Kujata</em>, the giant bull who rests on top of Arabian Bahamut.
</li></ul></li><li> The lamia is a monster that, depending on the edition, is: a woman's upper body with a snake's tail instead of legs; a female lion-centaur; or a woman who can turn into a swarm of insects <em>a la</em> the Mummy. In Greek mythology, Lamia was a woman transformed into a child-killing demon, and later a whole class of quasi-vampiric spirits were called <em>lamiae</em> (singular <em>lamia</em>). Lamia also got confused with the Kabbalistic Lillith, a <em>different</em> child-killing demon, at some point. Just to keep score, the snake-woman's real name is "Echidna," the liontaur is "Urmahlullu," and the swarm-shifter is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Totally Awesome</a>."
</li><li> In fact, D&amp;D ended up wielding this trope against <em>itself</em>. In the first edition of AD&amp;D, the demons didn't have species names; they were simply "Type III Demon," "Type VI Demon," and so on, in order of increasing power. Balor, Vrock, Marilith, and all those were the names of particular demons, samples (or possibly leaders) of their respective types. In the 2nd edition of the game, the given names had morphed over to be applied as species names of the entire Type, so all Type VI Demons were now called Balors, etc., and the "Type ___" designations went by the wayside.
</li><li> Speaking of the Fomorians... As of 4th Edition each Fomor has a cursed Evil Eye that gives them a magical power, but also a painful curse. This was originally a quality of only Balor, but it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">too cool a concept</a> not to apply to the whole race.
</li><li> Changelings in 3.5e D&amp;D are humanoids that are part human and part doppelganger. Changelings in folklore are fairy children used as decoys for stolen babies. Magic: the Gathering has the same problem (using "changeling" to mean "a creature that changes"). Made even worse because in a third-edition issue of Dragon Magazine, where the fey children being swapped out with real ones was their actual origin, until they decided to make the Eberron Changelings.
</li><li> Then there are kobolds. The name originally referred to a type of elf or brownie from Germanic folklore, usually found in a house, on a ship, or in a mine. It was applied to a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">small, dog-like, savage, cowardly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>. Then 3rd Edition came along and turned them reptilian (though they were scaly even back when they were dog-like), with possibly-true delusions of draconic relations. Then 3.5 and 4th Edition went and made those relations unequivocally <em>real</em>... This was the case before 3e; on top of being scaly, the 2e MM describes kobolds as being egg-layers. They were implicitly reptilian well before 3e came out, 3e just made a connection with dragons explicit.
</li><li> <em>Deities and Demigods</em> sourcebook turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Sif</a>, goddess of beauty, wealth, and the harvest into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>.

</li><li> D&amp;D is also responsible for re-perpetuating Hearn's confusion of the <em>mujina</em> with the <em>noppera-b&#333;</em>.
</li><li> An early <em>Deities and Demigods</em> features Lakota mythology. Suffice it to say, it takes a few liberties, many dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a>.
</li><li> The creatures called Gorgons are not remotely like the Gorgon Sisters of Greek Myth. Instead, they appear to be based on the Khalkotauroi, large bulls with bronze hooves and teeth that could breathe fire. Except, in <em>D&amp;D</em> they have petrifying breath based on Medusa's ability to turn whatever looks at her to stone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> has a deliberate example. In Judeo-Christian tradition, cherubim are the second-highest rank of angels. When Thoth used angelic ranks to classify the Hands of Aten (which locked their power levels), however, he used "cherubim" for the <em>lowest</em> rank. The reason? Ever since Raphael, humans have associated "cherub" with winged babies (which themselves are derived from the Greek Erotes), and so the idea has more resonance than "cherubim" as kick-ass angel warrior, trapping the Hands thus named in a weakened state.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a></em> gamelines, especially the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em>, fell into this fairly often. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalLettersAreMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalLettersAreMagic">Capital Letters Are Magic</a> meant a lot of concepts in the setting were assigned names from real world cultures or mythologies, but often in a manner tangentially-related at best. (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> writers are more aware of this and generally use real-world myths and legends more appropriately.)
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">vampire clan</a> of warrior-philosophers turned rebel-anarchists are the Brujah, derived from the Spanish word for "witch". While somewhat applicable, Brujah vampires have the most physically-based set of Disciplines (vampire powers); most other clans have far more overt mystical powers (e.g., the Tremere, the clan of vampire wizards, can actually throw fireballs).
</li><li> <em>Gilgul</em> is a concept of reincarnation in Jewish Kabbalism, but in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> it refers to the most severe punishment among Awakened: the removal of a mage's reincarnated Avatar. It's almost like referring to extinguishing a flame as "The Ignition".
</li><li> A few relating to the Tzimisce vampire clan of East European vampire sorcerers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> makers:
<ul><li> <em>Vozhd</em> is an old Slavonic word meaning "leader", but refers to giant, barn-sized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> monstrosities the Tzimisce create by merging several dozen people or animals together.
</li><li> <em>Bogatyri</em> was a term for a group of medieval Russian folk heroes, but in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a> refer to a race of blonde giants who served the Tzimisce.
</li><li> <em>Szlachta</em> is a Polish word referring to a historic class of nobility, but refers to ghouls fleshcrafted by the Tzimisce into pure killing machines.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> tends to be more faithful to mythology than D&amp;D (especially considering that they use dozens of incredibly obscure creatures pulled from across the globe), but even they have to make exceptions:
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Nuckelavee">Nuckelavee<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is portrayed accurately by the artists, but the fluff describes it as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">a manifestation of nature's rage against all who despoil its beauty</a>". The mythological Nuckelavee (and the one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 2E) is best summed up as a textbook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Tengu</a> are depicted as street rats who care little for religion, and yamabushi are described as a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">oni</a> that disguises itself as an evil tengu. A yamabushi is actually <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamabushi">a type of hermit-monk in the Shugendo religion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, also known as a shugenja. Tengu themselves generally appear in myth as exaggerated yamabushi, even more distant and spiritual than their human counterparts, with elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a>.
</li><li> Shikigami are portrayed as a race of tiny rock-men skilled with improvised weapons. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo">Onmy&#333;d&#333;</a> a shikigami is any creature bound to a spellcaster as a servant, making it essentially identical to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Familiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Familiar">Familiar</a> of the wizard and sorcerer (but not witch) classes.
</li><li> A few of the monsters lifted straight from the medieval bestiaries are given heavy artistic license due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. Bestiary 4's Barometz refers to a gigantic ram-shaped mass of vegetation created by druids as a nature guardian whereas the mythical one was simply a very odd plant with a lamb attached to it like an umbilical cord. Also from Bestiary 4, the Myremecoleon is an elephant-sized insect that spews acid while the mythical inspiration was a giant ant with a lion's head whose gimmick was it could not eat plants or meat, so it always starved to death.
</li></ul></li><li> Rakshasa in Hindu scripture are demon-like demigods who are generally evil. Raksha in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">sapient vortexes of chaotic energy</a> that happen to take human form, and serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>. This came about in part because of <a class="urllink" href="http://nobilis.me/quotes:secret-history-of-the-raksha">a writing issue<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: a lot of material for the first edition Fair Folk book came in way too close to publication for a proper rewrite, yet not delivering anything near what the line developer wanted, meaning that the developer and one writer on hand ended up slotting in Hindu mythological concepts and Sanskrit words just to get something other than the European fae clich&eacute;s they'd been given.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example in the Fourth Edition <em>Golden Age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> sourcebook. The sample villains included The Doberman, a less-than-competent "master villain" obsessed with dogs and dog-themed crimes, who dresses like the god Anubis (who he believes to be the Egyptian god of dogs). Justified in that:
<ul><li> the guy is completely bonkers.
</li><li> Anubis is playing along with this because giving heroes someone to practice on is worth a misdirected prayer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BetrayalAtHouseOnTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BetrayalAtHouseOnTheHill">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a></em> has a scenario called "Worm Ouroboros", involving a giant two-headed snake that is trying to grow big enough to crush the house. The snake has more in common with the Aphisbaena (a snake with two heads, one at each end of its body) that the ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail).

<ul><li> Played with in <em>The Rainmaker</em>, where Starbuck tells Lizzie the story of Melisande, wife of King Hamlet, who was "the fella who sailed around the ocean and brought back the Golden Fleece." Lizzie is quite aware that Starbuck is making up things as he goes, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a> he is.

<ul><li> For the most part, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">&#332;kami</a></em> doesn't really care about mythological accuracy. However, one aspect is particularly relevant: mythological Amaterasu was associated with ravens, crows, roosters and horses, but not wolves; stories of sun devouring wolves are a staple in eastern asian religions, though admittedly not as common in Japan. This is due to being a pun, as Okami translates to either "great god" or "wolf", rather than suddenly bothering with accuracy on this one thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em>, with Norse mythology. The game claims Ragnarok will be between the Aesir and the Vanir (the original has the Aesir against the Jotuns), Surt was in frost-encased Jotunheim (when Surt was a <em>fire</em> giant), and makes Frey and Freya into Aesir (they're Vanir), and Odin has both eyes . Also, in the original Japanese version, Frey and Freya's names were swapped. In either case Frey is female and doesn't really fit the mythological figure, but although Freya is an appropriate name for the chief goddess, it's <em>not</em> an appropriate name for a glorified gate guard.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em> games. All of them. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> examples above also qualify here.
<ul><li> In <em>Heroes of Might and Magic</em>, Nagas are portrayed as the <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> monster, Mariliths. In fact, Nagas and Garudas are presented as Anthropomorphic monsters often. Garudas have actually been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">brought back</a> to their origins because this ties better with the possibility that they might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a>.
</li><li> The third game also has "Gorgons" that are giant metallic bulls, just like in <em>D&amp;D</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Shiva is a goddess of ice and snow and not the eight-armed male Hindu god of destruction. However, this mythtake is explainable: "Shiva" is a pun on the phonetically similar "Shiver" (ice, snow, shiver &mdash; get it?).
</li><li> Revenant Wings plays around with this however in that there are 3 Shiva Summons. Shiva, Shivar, and Shivan. (Shiva, Darling Shiva, and Baby Shiva in the Japanese version) Shivar is male. (And Stated to be Shiva's Lover, while Shivan, again female, is her child)
</li><li> Several Final Fantasies also mess with Celtic mythology for a bit, including summons such as C&uacute; Chulainn and M&aacute;el D&uacute;in. This gets somewhat weird when it turns out M&aacute;el D&uacute;in (or Maduin, or Madeen, depending on the translator) is actually important to the plot in FFVI and FFIX. (It gets even weirder when the only instance of the halfway correct translation of the character's name is a recurring random enemy called "Maelduin," who is a <em>blind fish</em>).
</li><li> Odin:
<ul><li> Odin and his steed Sleipnir, the latter of which keeps losing or gaining limbs with each interpretation. Odin himself always has both of his eyes, he has all of a sudden grown horns, and he is never found wielding his spear Gungnir, but rather the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">instant-kill sword</a> Zantetsuken. At least he does use his spear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>.
</li><li> In most of his appearances, his summon does a die roll and on success it uses Zantetsuken ("Iron-Cutting Sword"), killing everything on the screen, and on failure uses Gungnir, which hits one random enemy for a fair amount of damage. Zantetsuken ("Iron-Cutting Sword") is a reference to Gram, given to Sigurd, broken, and when it was later reforged, it split the anvil in half.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> at least, he only uses the spear against enemies immune to instant death, there's no die roll involved.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Guardian Force</a> Quetzalcoatl (actually "Quezacotl" since there was only room for 9 letters), a bird-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Being</a> that shoots off lightning at foes. It was named after the Mesoamerican god whose name means "Feathered Serpent" and was the patron god of wisdom, knowledge, and the morning star.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> Garuda is shown as another female deity when all research points to Garuda being male.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, a creature that is clearly a chimera is labeled as a harpy. However, this is a translation error; in Japanese, the creature is correctly identified as a Chimera.
</li><li> Bahamut is most famous for being the king of dragons in this series, and one of the most powerful summons ever. The actual Bahamut is a giant <strong>fish</strong> that supports the earth and has the head of a hippopotamus. However, in this case, Bahamut was borrowed from Dungeons and Dragons.
</li><li> Titan is an earth elemental, the only connection to the original myth being the name of its attack: Gaia's Wrath. Which is probably a complete coincidence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series falls into this a few times, although the strangest example by far is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow">Zephyr</a>, a time-controlling boss whose namesake was a Greek wind god (the boss itself is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to Dio Brando of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>.
</li><li> Gorgons are oxen wielding petrification breath, as opposed to snake haired ladies with petrifying gazes. They appear to be based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> creature of the same name, which are more closely based on a different creature, the Khalkotauroi.
</li><li> The series HAS shown gorgons as how they're usually portrayed, except these ones are all male, and can turn into several snakes.
</li><li> Succubi are... female vampires, as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">Horny Devils</a>. Made even weirder when non-succubi female vampires appear in <em>Order Of Ecclesia</em>. Sometimes they do make reference to them attacking in someone's dreams or sleep, however.
</li><li> Persephone is a demon maid if her description is anything to go by. In practice, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Ninja Maid</a>. She's <em>supposed</em> to be Hades' wife...
</li><li> According to the official <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> timeline, Bram Stoker's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> is canon to the series.

<ul><li> The series does this with Greek mythology, generally making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> while excising some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squick</a>. But it generally hits on the established personalities of the deities. <em>God of War</em> makes an all-too common mistake modern adaptations of Greek myths often make (mainly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>): depicting the Greek pantheon as ruthless tyrants who oppress and abuse humanity. The truth is that Greek myths were lighthearted, reflecting the general disposition of the people who invented them. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> elements were first conceived in the dark ages. It's somewhat justified in the ending of the final game where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out all the gods, including Zeus, were infected by humanity's evils after Kratos opened <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PandorasBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PandorasBox">Pandora's Box</a> in the first game</span>.
</li><li> Beyond the personalities of the gods, the games are full of things that are nowhere to be found in the original myths. Pandora's Box imbues Kratos with power that allows him to fight Ares on equal footing. The Golden Fleece is... a pauldron... which allows Kratos to throw balls of energy... All right, moving on. Kronos being condemned to wander a desert carrying a mountain likewise is a completely new invention by the developers.
</li><li> Typhoon was not a Titan in the original mythology. He was a monstrous enormous beast and the only being Zeus feared and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">almost singlehandedly overthrew him</a> but was defeated. However, his birth varies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. Some stories have him as the son of Gaia with no father, born out of Gaia's rage at The Giants she sired being destroyed by Hercules and the Gods (although not stated to be a Giant himself) while other stories have Typhon as the son of Hera and only Hera. and another story has Typhon born thanks to Kronos semen being smeared across 2 rocks at the request of Hera because she was angry at Zeus at the time. But in none of these stories is Typhon a Titan.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarPS4">God of War (PS4)</a></em> does a similar spin with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>. For example, both the myths and the game has Baldur be associated with light and invulnerable to all things save for mistletoe. But while the former is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticLightSource" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticLightSource">so bright and beautiful that light shines off of him</a> and was granted his invulnerability by his mother getting nearly everything in existence to swear to not hurt him, the latter is noticeably capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">driven mad by his invulnerability because his mother caused it by casting a spell without his consent that had the side-effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseLossSadness">utterly removing his ability to feel</a>, and the mistletoe vulnerability is because all Vanir spells have some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback">required weakness</a></span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TooHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TooHuman">Too Human</a></em>, the Jormungandr is a type of massive war machine created by Ymir, of which only one survives to the time of the game. This is particularly jarring, as prior to this, the game gets a surprising amount of Norse mythology <em>right</em>, and most of the divergences were necessary to the altered setting, or to the story they wanted to tell. For instance the Aesir are cyborg super soldiers who defend post-apocalyptic humanity from robotic "giants". But still resurrecting Baldr during the Fimbulwinter instead of after Ragnarok is new.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireI">Breath of Fire I</a></em> is Tyr, the antithesis to the Dragon clan... an evil she-demon, with dragon like powers... Tyr, however, was the Norse <strong>god</strong> of single combat, victory, and heroic glory. He also had his hand bitten off by Fenrir when they tricked the wolf into allowing himself to be chained. This may have been an attempted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a>: her Japanese name (Myria) doesn't seem to be a reference to anything. Except, of course, to myriad, which could be a reference to the demon called Legion, for he is many.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a male boss named "Skadi the Ruthless" in Utgarde Pinnacle. Skadi was the Norse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinterRoyalLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinterRoyalLady">goddess of winter</a> and the hunt.
</li><li> There is actually a <em>male</em> Skadi in Nordic myth; they're just very, very obscure. The Wrath character could have been named for them.
</li><li> <em>Wrath Of The Lich King</em> is full of Nordic mythology counterparts, but they generally get it right. Freya (fertility) as a guardian of nature, Loken is a trickster, and so on.
</li><li> There are also a large amount of monsters inspired by D&amp;D, which in turn are often named after various mythological beings but have very little resemblance with the original stories.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> introduced Helheim: home of damned souls. In Norse mythology, Helheim was the home of anyone who didn't die in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>:
<ul><li> Beowulf, the hero of the Geats in the old English poem, is actually a dog-demon thing that becomes gauntlets and greaves that glow with light in this series. It's like they got him confused with Beowulf's greatest enemy Grendel. Geryon, the monster from Greek mythology said to be a giant with three bodies, and then later described in the Divine Comedy as a winged beast with the tail of a scorpion but the face of a man, is really a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">time-stopping</a> horse that draws a large carriage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">However</a>, the giant Geryon was a horse <em>owner.</em>
</li><li> On the other hand, the original game hits close to accurate with Alastor, a sword found impaled into a statue of the Judge of Death: in demonology, Alastor is the name given to the supreme arbiter of the court of Hell. Or, alternately, Hell's chief Executioner. Furthermore Alastor is a Greek term for "avenger", notably both a title given to Zeus and the name of a man executed by Zeus, which would explain the lightning attacks in the game.
</li><li> Also, Beowulf's name and design really make no sense at all when you discover where his likeness came from. His original inspiration was almost certainly <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazuzu">Pazuzu<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a Babylonian demon of disease, who literally looks exactly like Beowulf. Scorpion tail? Check. Two pairs of wings? Check. Claws on the feet and hands? Check. The face of a dog? Check. Yet despite all of this, they name him Beowulf, and call him a demon of light.
</li><li> Naming a succubus <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevan">Nevan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> really doesn't make sense at all.

<ul><li> Pretty much in every single one of its numerous incarnations, does this to some extent. However, they're generally excused for their creative license for the sheer amount they get <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">right</a></strong></em>, especially given the prevalence of this trope. As the massive bibliographies for the games included in some of the Japanese-only companion books clearly indicate, this is not so much a mistake as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. Rather disappointingly, though, especially with its traditionally major role in the franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">Cerberus</a> remains some sort of lion-wolf with only one head in all but three games, due to its portrayal in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DigitalDevilStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DigitalDevilStory">Digital Devil Story</a></em> novels and anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">from which the video games took off</a>.
</li><li> One-headed Kerberos is actually the original portrayal. Later portrayals emphasised multiple heads, while varying on the actual number. The idea that it has 3 heads specifically did not sink in until the Renaissance. The three-headed version is thus, in itself, an example of both this trope and of literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Word of Dante</a>.
</li><li> As an example of minor deviancies, Metatron is adorned with crosses despite not being in Christian canon. Many games also mistake the Zhu Que or Suzaku with Feng Huang whenever the Chinese names are used. The Zhu Que and Feng Huang were not always distinct, and in many non-Han variations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGods">four gods</a> they are still considered the same creature. This might still be considered unusual for the SMT series, which, if anything, often errs on the side differentiating characters who, in the source material, were the same being named in different languages.
</li><li> The Egyptian god Seth is traditionally depicted as an animal that somewhat resembles a jackal, an aardvark, a fox, or a combination all of the above. Not in SMT, however; here, he's depicted as a <em>gigantic black dragon</em>. This is in contrast to all the other Egyptian gods in the series that are accurately portrayed (for example, Horus, Seth's foil, is portrayed as a falcon like in the myths).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game can top any of the above for bizarre portrayal of Tiamat. In <em>Darksiders</em>, Tiamat is a giant bat monster.
</li><li> That's only the tip of the iceberg as far as <em>Darksiders</em> is concerned. For a game that is obstentially based off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Book of Revelation</a>, it bears very little resemblance to it.
</li><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">small amount of justification</a>, in the implications that Man's knowledge of Armageddon is either fragmented, misconstrued or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">outright lies</a>, and to top it all off, the actual plan for Armageddon has been thrown completely out of whack as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s scheme, so even if mankind knew all of the original concept it would STILL be wrong.

Gaia is depicted as a sexless-looking, hostile golem, rather than the goddess of the Earth. On a smaller scale, Orpheus' love interest is renamed Helene (Eurydice who?), the Hydra has only one head, Prometheus is guarded by the Nemean Lion rather than savaged by an eagle, and Circe is depicted as an old crone instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a>. Hades is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, but that's somewhat justified by his kidnapping of Helene being modelled on that of Persephone in the myth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> doesn't even bother with accuracy, as many of the summon names were pretty obviously assigned based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">what sounded cool</a>.
<ul><li> Boreas, minor Greek god of the north wind, is <em>a giant snow-cone machine</em> in the <em>Golden Sun</em> universe. That is all. Until <em>Dark Dawn</em>, in which he became a giant, <em>literal</em> Iron Horse. Wait, <em>what?</em> Only thing they got right about Boreas is that it is the wind the brings <em>winter</em>, fitting the ice theme.
</li><li> Ramses is a ridiculous giant head with even more ridiculous floating fists.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherNature">Cybele</a> is a surprised-looking tree-horned frog.

</li><li> Perhaps the most hilarious example occurs with the summon Neptune (derived from the Roman name for the god of the sea, Neptunus). At certain point in <em>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</em>, you fight a boss named Poseidon, which is the same entity only now under its Greek name. You can technically have the summon attack itself. Never mind that the Neptune summon is a giant whale with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> for a blowhole.</em>
</li><li> And then there's Moloch, the Canaanite god of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Biblical fame</a>, whose man-made idol with a fire in its stomach was apparently offered babies by its worshippers.

Palutena herself is supposed to be Pallas Athena, but is now pretty much a different character entirely (her most notable trait? She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>).

</li><li> Pit himself is an angel, despite the fact that there are none in Greek Mythology. He's actually closer to Cupid/Eros due to his use of bows, and has been depicted as shooting heart arrows at times. <em>Uprising</em> plays with this by keeping the fact that he's an angel, and then making the Angel Bow shoot hearts to keep the discrepancy up.
</li><li> Of course, the game gets its name from Icarus, who was not an angel, but a human whose wings were made of wood, feathers, and wax and attached to his arms. In the myth, Icarus flew too close to the sun, causing the wax in the wings to melt, and then he fell to his death. Conversly in the original game, Pit's wings were generally useless, but he shared his mythological namesake's tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">fall to his death</a>.

Kraken was shoehorned in to make a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans1981" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans1981">Clash of the Titans</a></em>.
</li><li> Neith is a goddess of many things, including being war goddess, hunting goddess, weaving the universe. What becomes a liberal interpretation is that in here, Neith is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">extremely bubbly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCutie">and cheerfully cute</a>.
</li><li> Vulcan is shown to still be resentful over Juno (Hera) casting him off Olympus when he's still an infant. As a result, he instead locks himself in his forge and makes as many items as he can in a vain attempt to ease that hatred, abandoning his wife Venus. In most other series, we usually see Vulcan as the decent guy whose wife is just plain unfaithful despite his love, but here, he's not completely guiltless.
</li><li> Aphrodite is revealed to have cheated a lot because she was being abandoned by Hephaestus (read above, Hephaestus is Vulcan's Greek counterpart), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">in order to feel that she's not a worthless wife</a>. And to top this off, Aphrodite turns out to be genuinely remorseful over her winning Paris' favor that resulted the Trojan War. Usually, we saw her as one of the less sympathetic goddesses for her unabashed cheating spree and probably was more content that she won Paris' favor and the title "The Fairest".
</li><li> Ao Kuang had this so much. For a Dragon King of the <em>Eastern Seas</em>, his skill set was more heavily around summoning storms and winds rather than water-based. His personality is kind of meek too, so it's not clear if it was during his time as a proud and cruel king, or after he received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a> from Sun Wukong and Ne Zha. As a result, Ao Kuang was retired temporarily while his old skillset is transferred to the Mayan God Kukulkan (who is more wind-based) and he is set to return with a more humanoid new model and having more dragon-based (and slightly water-based) skills, including an <em>execution</em>. Under the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing">five-elemental system<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of China, a rain-based skill set for such a character could possibly be more a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>. Especially since Wood, the element of the East, is associated with the ocean, and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">patron symbol</a> is a dragon. While it's counter-intuitive in terms of what we might think of as an 'element', rain is associated with Wood/Tree element, rather than Water. The Chinese 'elements' are types of changes, rather than types of substance. Wood represents growth, precipitation, and cool, gentle-yet-powerful movements &mdash; traits associated with Wind under Greek philosophy, and most definitely associated with the ocean and dragons in Chinese.
</li></ul></li><li> In spite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">what they get right</a>, the developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> do get a few things wrong.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> for the Dragonscale Shields upgrade, which identifies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Grendel</a> as a dragon.
</li><li> When <em>Tale of the Dragon</em> expansion was first released, Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor) was conflated with Yu Di (the Jade Emperor), who is a different mythological figure entirely, in his description in the in-game encyclopedia. This was corrected in a later patch.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em> gives the name Iblis to the mindless, destructive part of Solaris. In the myths, Iblis was a crafty, cunning and highly arrogant djinn (a being of fire), and essentially was the Devil in Islamic mythology, as Satan is in Christian mythology. His primary activity is to incite humans and djinni to commit evil through deception, which is essentially what Mephiles does in the game, rather than Iblis. The only thing they have in common is that they're both beings of fire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> A lot of the characters' names are taken from various myths, but the characters' role aren't not always following the narrative of the original myth; Naoise and Dierdre are not a tragic couple, Naoise is a simple knight and Dierdre's tragic romance is with Sigurd, who came from a different mythical pantheon.
</li><li> The most notable of case of mistaken myth is the bow Ichaival / Yewfelle. For the longest time, the Japanese wiki seem to be under the impression that the bow belonged to the Norse God of Archery Ullr is called Ichaival because <em>Genealogy of Holy War</em> associates the bow with its character Ullr. There's no mention of Ullr's bow name in the myth; <em>Genealogy</em> was likely corrupted Yewfelle, Ullr's divine home, into Ichaival through language rendition. The name bleeds into other works like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SenkiZesshouSymphogear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SenkiZesshouSymphogear">Senki Zesshou Symphogear</a></em> through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCultureOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCultureOsmosis">Pop Culture Osmosis</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EndlessOcean">Endless Ocean</a>: Blue World</em>'s final area, the Cavern of the Gods, takes its cues from Egyptian mythology, with alters dedicated to Osiris, Horus, Isis and Nephthys. Except that all the related statues are male (complete with beard postiches), Osiris is depicted with a papyrus scepter (which is traditionally feminine), and Isis has Osiris' trademark crook. Horus is also missing his trademark falcon head, but depictions of him as fully human aren't unheard of.

<ul><li> When recounting the backstory of Rider/Medusa and her sisters, the narration explains that Stheno and Euryale had perfect immortality, unlike the rest of the Greek gods who needed to eat the golden apples to sustain theirs. This is incorrect; it was the gods of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse</a></em> pantheon who had to eat the golden apples of I&eth;unn to retain their youth (possibly they got mixed up with the Ambrosia the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek gods</a> ate, which could supposedly grant immortality, although the gods weren't necessarily dependent on it themselves).
</li><li> Rin wonders if Saber's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHair">Idiot Hair</a> is her "reverse scale", so she cuts it off to see what will happen, resulting in Saber transforming into her Alter form. However, reverse scales are only a feature of East Asian dragons &mdash; a scale on the underside of their chins that causes the normally benevolent Eastern dragon to go berserk if agitated &mdash; while Saber was infused with the blood of a Western dragon. It is explained in later lore that <em>all</em> dragons have reverse scale, but it's not always in the same place. Elisabeth Bathory, who is dragon-blooded in this universe, has her reverse scale near the base of her tail.

However <em>Gargoyles</em> does not claim to represent the myths, but rather the "real" events that evolved into the myths, so this is mostly deliberate. The various gods and such were clearly presented as being related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> of European folklore, in keeping with the show's world-spanning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology">Crossover Cosmology</a>. And not everything is different from the myths: for example, Anubis is quite neutral and emphatic about his nonpartisan role, not evil as in many modern stories. Also, the series' co-creator has explained that the error involving Sleipnir's legs was due to the animation company being unable to animate an eight-legged horse, and presenting him as a four-legged one was better than not having him at all, or just using crappy animation. He stated he would've greatly preferred an eight-legged horse, but had no choice. So, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waves</a> as best he can in his mind: like all the other Third Race, the horse is also a shapeshifter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> repeats the usual error in making Anubis a demonic figure of menace instead of a sedate guide.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MummiesAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MummiesAlive">Mummies Alive!</a></em> did this with Egyptian mythology in so many ways: Egyptians believing in reincarnation, Ancient Egyptian deities behaving more like rogue mystic entities behaving loosely like their mythological namesakes (when Anubis, god of the dead, is portrayed as a moronic entity with a dog motif, you know it's bad). When Anubis is portrayed as god of the dead, or god of death, you also know it's bad. That role belonged to Osiris; Anubis was a very minor god of embalmment.
