<p>When a game is made, it usually undergoes extensive testing, to ensure that the gameplay goes smoothly. Unfortunately, then it goes into the hands of the public, who collectively can (and will) conduct more gameplay in one hour than your testers were able to do in a year. And the gaming public usually pick up on whatever your Quality Assurance team missed. Any glitches, combinations, or exploits the game testers or programmers overlooked, ignored or flat-out didn't find, you can be sure that the players will find it, sooner or later.

Generally, the derailment is less frowned upon when the resulting new gameplay is exciting, varied, and rewards skilled play, as opposed to, for example, limiting the game to who can press a button the fastest or rewarding everyone who does nothing but wait out the clock. For better or for worse, it can change a game completely and render some portion of the game's (intended) tactics useless.

</li></ul></dd></dl><p></p><h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul><li> One of the very earliest examples of Gameplay Derailment was "camping" in multiplayer games, where it became optimal for players to stand and wait in a strong defensive position to gain an advantage over approaching players, or to wait next to a powerful pick-up item to constantly gain its benefits and use them to kill others approaching the item. This not only shifted the skillset required to win but introduced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> where if everyone camps, no-one gets any kills because no-one is moving around; but anyone who moves around to try to get kills will instead be killed by the campers from their advantageous positions. Until game designs were able to overcome this, some of the most common mod scripts would automatically kill players who remained in a single area for too long.
<ul><li> Before even this was <em>runner scumming</em> in <em>Netrek</em>. In that game, a strong tactic in a space battle is to fly away from the opponent while firing backwards at them. This again reduced many battles to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonersDilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> where if one player flies away, the other has to either give chase and fight from a disadvantaged position, or also fly away and abandon the battle.
</li></ul></li><li> The original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em> contains a glitch that allows players to warp across the screen by hitting the Select button at a certain moment during the scrolling segue. This lets players to bypass obstacles easily, reaching items and areas much earlier than intended.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> has been so extensively analyzed and broken that speedrunners have brought down playtime to 17min:47sec. Keep in mind that the layman takes about 20 hours on a first playthrough and around 10-12 hours on a second.
</li><li> By exploiting collision mechanics (i.e. going through walls), it is easily possible to beat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> with only 16 stars, with a best time of 17min:31sec. If human skills weren't an issue, the game could be completed by collecting zero stars, and all that in <a class="urllink" href="http://tasvideos.org/2016M.html">just over 5 minutes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> It is possible to beat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> in 54 minutes, due to a variety of collision glitches and skips.
</li><li> The entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series revolves around nonlinear gameplay, although in later games this nonlinearity is usually found by manipulating collisions. For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>, it is possible to walk around doors and outside of the actual map. This is used to skip entire boss fights (namely Quadraxis) in <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em> speedruns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> is a relatively short game anyway, but a speedrun of it was done in <em>9 minutes and 25 seconds.</em> This was made possible by a glitch involving shooting portals precisely on the edge of surfaces so they actually were shot outside the map, allowing the speedrunner to skip most of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> has a similar problem; its speedrun record is around 30 minutes due to a glitch which essentially causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">Double Jump</a>, thus allowing the player to skip many passages of the game.
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> speedruns or challenges rely on abusing A.I., mostly by letting them open doors sooner than they are supposed to. Tripmines can also be used to climb walls.
</li><li> One of the biggest examples is the discovery of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Combos">Combos</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em>. Characters were not supposed to be able to string moves together in this way, but they became so central to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Games</a> that one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em>'s selling points was its polished combo system. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchParry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchParry">Parrying</a>, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">third installment</a>, is another instance. Since perfect mastery of parrying is a prerequisite in higher levels of play, the risk of being countered turned virtually all non-casual matches into Chun-dominated turtle-fests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Wavedashing</a>" in <em>Melee</em> allows those who master it to rapidly change direction, attack while moving as if the character is standing still, and in some cases speed around the playing field much quicker than is otherwise possible. Performed by air-dodging into the ground at the very start of a jump, thus causing the character to slide across the surface, it was recognized during development, but they didn't take it out because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">didn't expect it to affect the metagame the way it did</a>. Wavedashing eventually became essential for and central to tournament gameplay, with many characters eschewing normal movement entirely in favor of wavedashing. It was removed from <em>Brawl</em> via a reworked air-dodge so that skilled players wouldn't have such a huge advantage over new players.
</li><li> <em>Brawl's</em> online mode had its own form of Gameplay Derailment. Normally when you go online in a fighting game you expect to fight other players, right? Well, the rise of "Taunt Parties" meant most of the matches you'd enter online would be filled with people doing anything <strong>but</strong> fighting. This included but was not limited to: taunting, dashing back and forth rapidly, showing off glitches/weird physics, doing their rapid jab combos for extended periods of time, suiciding in flashy ways, throwing items up and catching them, bouncing projectiles between two reflectors, bouncing <em>themselves</em> between bumpers, Landmaster riding and all other sorts of tomfoolery that, among other things, included <em>ganging up on anyone who dared to actually hit someone else</em>. Yes, you read that right. If you actually tried to fight in a fighting game they would punish you by ganging up on you. Now this may not sound so bad, and it wouldn't be if you could just drop out of the match and find another. But it got to the point where <strong>there were more taunt parties than legit matches</strong>. If you actually wanted to fight someone else, you were either stuck fighting a 3-on-1 battle or hoping you would get lucky and find an honest-to-goodness free-for-all in all the taunt parties.
</li><li> The "Taunt Party" behavior led to a new form of a "Taunt Party Game" when the fourth installment came out- Villager roulette. One Villager starts by growing and chopping down a tree, and the other pockets it. The battle continues by using the tree as the only form of offense. Villagers take turns throwing and pocketing the tree. When the tree is lost, whether it be by a hit or drop, the person who held it last grows a new tree for the other player to pocket. Play continues until a KO is made, or until a player's stock runs out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em>:
<ul><li> Snaking. In the DS version, if you manage to snake after a rocket boost from the starting light and not mess up, then it's known as the prolonged rocket boost glitch, which lets you keep driving at rocket speeds as long as you kept snaking from the green light. Mario Kart Wii changed the sliding mechanic so that you have to maintain a power slide in order to charge up mini turbos instead of waggling left and right really fast.
</li><li> <em>Wii</em> also introduced bikes, which can't charge up mini turbos to the same degree as karts, but popping wheelies gives a speed boost (at the expense of turning ability, which becomes practically nonexistent), though you will slow down a lot if bumped into while using a wheelie. However, this mechanic, like snaking, is abused to the point where everyone just chooses to use only bikes and wheelies on every chance they get, generally having the upper hand over kart players.
</li><li> Occasionally, a glitch will pop up in a <em>Mario Kart</em> game where deliberately falling off the track will relocate you to either a later area or allow you to skip laps. Naturally, this renders time trials runs on any course using such a glitch unbeatable by those who don't know of or refuse to use the glitch. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was the first game with online play with such a glitch easy enough to do consistently (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSportsResort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSportsResort">Maka Wuhu, AKA Wuhu Mountain Loop</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jvvk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0jvvk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jvvk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A few other courses have similar glitches, but they are all both high-risk and low-gain, so most players deem it not worth wagering one's rank to get what would be a one- or two-second edge in an online race. In addition, the previous entry, <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>, has a lap-skipping glitch in Grumble Volcano, but it requires a Mushroom, convincing many, but not most, to play it as intended</span>). Until an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> came out to fix it&mdash;to give an idea of how bad it got, this was Nintendo's first such patch&mdash;many people selected that course to play over and over. As it was the quickest course in the game to finish due to the glitch and because you rank up in every position but last place, playing solely Maka Wuhu was the clear choice for people trying to grind up the ranks as rapidly as possible.
</li></ul></li><li> Pudding farming in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>. It's simple arithmetic: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster">Asteroids Monster</a> + <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a> = infinite items and equipment. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">This isn't as useful as it seems</a>, so the developers weren't in a hurry to stop it.
<div class="indent"> "The DevTeam has arranged an automatic and savage punishment for pudding farming. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishmentIsTheCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishmentIsTheCrime">It's called pudding farming</a>." - Jove
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>: Most major patches eliminate one or two instances; Buriza Do Kyanon, Hammeridins, etc. Amazon builds particularly tend to be flavor-of-the-month thanks to this.
<ul><li> The original <em>Diablo 3</em> featured built-in inter-player trading via the marketplace. This meant that until you reached the highest Inferno type difficulty levels, the best strategy was not to make use of any items found while exploring, but to sell them all for gold to spend on the marketplace; since players on the higher levels would be getting items as "junk" which would be useless on those levels but incredibly powerful on the lower levels, they would usually be available almost on demand for extremely low prices. For similar reasons, there was no point upgrading the in-game gem crafters or item upgrade stations because doing so would cost significantly more than just buying the higher power gems from other players.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has had classes doing roles they were never quite intended to. In the <em>Burning Crusade</em> expansion, Rogues could stack Dodge and Agility so high that they could tank some of the strongest bosses by dodging their every attack indefinitely. In <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, a Mage made use of Spellsteal, a pack of enemies with a stealable shield spell, and talents to increase damage from the effects of such a shield to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ggLGj37qI">solo several 25 player dungeon bosses<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Many players "farm" old raids and dungeons for gold, cool-looking gear, and mounts by tackling them alone. While the level discrepancy usually makes it easy to simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curbstomp the enemies to oblivion</a>, more recent out-dated bosses and bosses with special mechanics require either special strategies, very high damage output, or both. A particularly infamous example of bosses that suffer Gameplay Derailment when soloed is Spine of Deathwing, the penultimate boss of <em>Cataclysm</em>'s final raid, whose original strategy hinged on the raid members standing in two groups on the boss' back - too much weight on either side and the boss would roll around, sending all players not affected by a certain buff to their dooms. With only one player, however, you have to <em>constantly</em> run between the left and right halves of the back, and standing still for a second too long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">means instant death.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> has had both positive and negative examples of this, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">which are which aren't always universally agreed upon</a>. Primary among the positive ones would be the community turning the Ninja job into an outstanding Evasion Tank.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are numerous ways speed-increasing modules have been changed, exploited, patched, exploited in different ways, then patched again.
</li><li> The use of Carriers (heavy combat support ships) for bulk cargo transport. Later blocked by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>.
</li><li> The Titans' Doomsday Weapons were changed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Sphere of Destruction</a> mode to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave Motion Guns</a> instead, because multiple Titans could annihilate entire fleets by firing their Doomsday Weapons at the same time. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> came after it was demonstrated that a coalition could put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">enough Titans</a> to the field to eliminate entire capital ship fleets with one coordinated attack.
</li><li> Ship insurance payouts were initially tied to the static mineral cost of the ship. When mineral prices in the market dropped below these static prices, it became profitable to build ships <em>just to commit insurance fraud</em> by blowing them up immediately after they rolled off the assembly line. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> changed the insurance payouts to vary according to market prices.
</li><li> Then a glitch was found using, ironically, the average market prices. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/22/eve-players-abuse-faction-warfare-to-produce-trillions-of-isk/">The system offered Loyalty Points for assets destroyed, using market price to estimate damage.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<ul><li> You buy worthless items that nobody ever buys (it's easy to manipulate statistics of items if you're the only one interacting with them). You trade those items with the rest of the group and the item's average price skyrockets. You then put the cargo on a ship and destroy it, and the group enjoys more Loyalty Points than EVE's variables can handle. This scheme was executed on the largest alliance scale and then presented to CCP (the game company). All characters involved got rolled back, and the mechanic was axed for good.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthAndBeyond">Earth And Beyond</a></em> had a bug where buffs which increased weapon speed stacked exponentially. This meant that if you obtained enough buff items, your weapon speed would increase toward infinity. This caused you to fire tens of thousands of rounds of ammo in a few seconds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">It was the equivalent of giving a muzzle-loading musket the rate of fire of a modern machine gun.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline">Dynasty Warriors Online</a></em> suffers from a lesser version of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Muosu attacks</a> make the user invincible as they unleash a temporary unbreakable combo. While a legitimate, intended attack, depending on who you are playing with, this might make up most of their attacks against you. Some people go Munchkin and max out their attack and musou, allowing you to go longer, and, weapon permitting, spam the stronger version, then run away from battle to refill. Given how powerful you can make a weapon, this may be an easy way of defeating somebody. This lead to the English-language version of the game PvP being full mostly of attempted one-combo kills in order to win the match, rather than using any other attacks. It's balanced out as time went on, with less people relying on Musou in PvP.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> is pretty clearly a cover-based shooter in the single-player. The multiplayer, on the other hand, mostly consists of players rolling and roadie running with shotguns out and occasionally using cover for wall bouncing (split instances to move closer to their opponents) if they don't get any of the powerful weapons, popshotting at each other when not rolling around to avoid getting hit. This was addressed in the sequel by changing the shotgun to have a less effective total range, making it impractical to use as a solo weapon but giving it more consistent power in the short range it was meant for, and adding a 'stopping power' mechanic, slowing players down to a steadily-increasing extent if they run in the direction of gunfire they are currently taking. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">Some people were indignant.</a> <br>When it became clear that wallbouncing with shotguns was <em>still</em> a more viable tactic than actually playing the game as intended despite the nerfs to the shotgun, for the third game they included a weapon that was created specifically to counter it. The Retro Lancer is an automatic assault rifle that is much more powerful than the standard Lancer but has crap accuracy outside of short range and no chainsaw bayonet. It still didn't stop wallbouncing for the most part. However, the Retro fell victim to its own gameplay derailment when people started tapping the trigger to only fire one bullet at a time, as the <em>first</em> bullet fired from the Retro has good accuracy, it's only when you continuously fire that it becomes terrible. Essentially the Retro became a stronger version of the Hammerburst (a semi-automatic rifle designed for longer ranges).
</li><li> The infamous "Combo Winter" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> was born when playtesters didn't exploit a mechanic on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">several powerful cards</a> in the <em>Urza's Saga</em> expansion nearly enough.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dwxk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1dwxk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dwxk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Just one example is the land "Tolarian Academy," which gives you one mana for every artifact you own. With enough artifacts and the ability to untap said Academy repeatedly, you can gain infinite mana.</span> Similarly, many cards in the <em>Mirrodin</em> block had to be banned for being way too powerful.
<ul><li> A particularly extreme example is Manaless Dredge, a deck which uses the Dredge mechanic to completely turn the game on its head. As the name implies, it runs no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> at all - instead, it chooses to go second (or has its opponent choose to go first, which is almost guaranteed in the lightning-paced Legacy format), draws an eighth card on its first turn, plays nothing, and discards a card with dredge due to being over its maximum hand size. It then uses this card to begin moving large numbers of cards from its library to its graveyard, triggering abilities on creatures like <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=452797">Narcomoeba<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413635">Ichorid<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that send them from the graveyard to the battlefield automatically.
</li></ul></li><li> Air unit stacking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI">StarCraft</a></em>. It turns Mutalisks into truly dangerous clusters of units, since not only can you not consistently target one of them, but they basically all shoot simultaneously at a particular target. Due to the general coolness of Muta-micro, however, Blizzard incorporated it into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em>... but only for Mutalisks. Certain splash damage-inflicting air units. such as the Valkyrie and Devourer, were introduced as partial countermeasures. This mechanic became such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a> that competitive Zerg players are <em>expected</em> to be able to micro Mutalisks in this way. There is also an exploit where you can make Lurkers not attack until you tell them to. This allows Zerg players to set up invisible Lurker traps, where the Lurkers don't attack until a bunch of Marines are all standing on top of them. Then they all die. This also works with Terran spider mines. This tactic is called "Stop Lurker" (now referred to as Hold Lurker) and is not banned in most competitive play. The technique for spider mines is banned, however, because it involves allying and un-allying your enemy. There is one illegal method for Hold Lurkers, because it involves changing diplomacy settings (similar to the Spider Mines).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The enemy control glitch in the GBA <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games. Most famous as FE7's "mine glitch", which is manageable due to the limited number of mines in the game, but it is still exploitable (and much more heinous) in FE8, potentially opening the gate to extensive usage throughout the games. For more details, see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/921183/38039">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> In theory, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a> mechanic is meant to make you put value into every unit you have, and to think very carefully before making risky decisions; if a unit dies, you're meant to think on your mistakes, accept their death, and move on. Additionally earlier games were made assuming players would play like this, and supplied players with way more units than they should ever need, while most units were made intentionally worse to serve as a punishment for the player if they got their good units killed and had to use these worse replacements. In practice however, unless explicitly playing under "ironman" rules where resetting is not allowed, most players just end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">restart-scumming</a> the current chapter until they can pull off a no-death run, or at least until they can win without losing any unit they were actively using, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroMustSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroMustSurvive">if the protagonist unit dies, it's game over anyway</a>. As a result players' armies end up swelling by the end of the game with a ton of units that never see any usage beyond their joining chapter, and players will take big risks when they know they can just restart or reload a mid-battle save if they lose someone. Even the developers are aware of and play like this, as revealed in interviews for <em>Fates</em>, and modern Fire Emblems have been designed with this in mind; first the practice of making so many intentionally worse units was abandoned and more effort was made to make most units at least decent if invested into, then <em>New Mystery Of The Emblem</em> added a "Casual Mode" where killed units come back the next chapter instead of staying permanently dead, and then <em>Shadows Of Valentia</em> added the "Mila's Timewheel" mechanic where players can rewind turns midbattle instead of restarting, which was later retained in <em>Three Houses</em> with its functionally identical "Divine Pulse" mechanic.
</li><li> This happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a> "Jagen" units in a large number of games. The intention on the part of the developers was to provide you with a character who was strong enough to help you out during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a>, but had limited potential compared to your other units and would be surpassed. However, this went through two phases.
<ul><li> At first, players refused to use Jagens <em>at all</em>, being of the opinion that giving them any kills would be a waste of XP and effort, not to mention using up the expensive weapons in their starting inventory&mdash;if they used Jagens for anything, it was taking away their weapons and using them as meatshields. They were widely dismissed as worthless joke units, and made sure to mark out the ones that actually did have long-term potential (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Seth</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Titania</a>) as "Oifey" units, advising players to only use those characters <em>outside</em> of the early game, since that was when enemies strong enough for a promoted character to gain levels off of would start to show up.
</li><li> Later on, players realized the opposite: in many games, the supposed downsides of a Jagen's lower growths and lesser potential didn't actually matter. The strength of player units tends to increase at a greater rate than that of the enemy, so the point in the game where a Jagen unit at their base stats is actually in real danger tends to be fairly late.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rq9g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2rq9g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rq9g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To give one example: Marcus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em> has 11 Speed. In Battle Before Dawn, generally considered the hardest chapter of the lategame, on the highest difficulty, most of the enemies are fighters with swordreavers&mdash;base speed of 9, weighed down to 7 by their weapons, so he doubles them. He also doubles the archers, the monks, and the shamans. He doesn't double every enemy on the map, but he does very well, and that's assuming his speed hasn't been raised <em>at all</em>&mdash;it has a 25% growth, and every point he gets is another segment of enemies to double, with 14 doubling anything that isn't a boss.</span> This resulted in players using Jagen units well past the point they were intended to serve as crutch units, sometimes taking them all the way to the endgame with success, with the "high potential" units they were meant to shepherd through the early-game being knocked for needing to be shepherded in the first place. And those "Oifey" units with actual growth rates? Well, Seth and Titania nowadays tend to get their own spot on the tier lists, due to far and away outclassing their competition in the most important part of the game and spending the rest of it as merely excellent.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Pod surfing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield2142">Battlefield 2142</a></em>, which allows players in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropPod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropPod">drop pods</a> to essentially ignore gravity. Because this allows them rapid travel as well as Mario-like invincibility against air vehicles, it has been patched away. Remaining, however, is the "RDX hopper": because "friendly fire off" also turns friendly splash damage off, demopak users are effectively walking explosions.
</li><li> Under the old scoring system in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgrammingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgrammingGame">Programming Game</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RoboWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RoboWar">Robo War</a></em>, robots score points in one-on-one battles based only on whether they survive the battle. Eventually, players figured out that the optimum strategy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentPlay">Tournament Play</a> for a robot that is even halfway competent at killing other robots is to sit around doing nothing so long as the opponent does the same, and wait for time to run out. The Aggressive Scoring system was implemented to give robots points for killing other robots, though this means less points for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> robots which use heavy shielding for defense but have trouble mounting an offense of their own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many players of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> find more enjoyment trying to abuse the level design to explore normally unreachable parts of maps or skip enemy spawning areas, which defeats all the work put into the game to make it an engaging FPS. In response to this, in order to appease the explorers, in the sequels the developers encouraged exploration by hiding secret things (most notably the Skulls) around in places most people wouldn't think of looking. Which didn't necessarily work out too well, as explorers are often more interested in how to get down or up incredibly high places without dying or trying to visit areas of the map seemingly surrounded by invisible walls, and not interested in shining a flashlight into every single nook and cranny.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, the Forge mode allows players to fly anywhere in the multiplayer maps, except for a few annoying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Walls</a> (some of which are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyWalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyWalls">Deadly Walls</a>). The result? Exploration in this game is centered around circumventing these walls to reach the few "off-limits" areas remaining. The campaign levels have no such flight ability, and so players still use traditional exploration techniques, such as grenade-jumping.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em> also features "button combos" which allow the player to shoot and melee someone almost simultaneously, as well as shoot twice at the same time. This is done by abusing the reload animation, and Bungie made sure to prevent these in <em>Halo 3</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Every edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has this in some form. 4.0 has the 'roles' working out far differently than they were supposed to, such that hyperspecialization is actually the way to go in a very <em>FF11</em> style fashion. Also, Daily powers turn into "super uber Encounter powers" if your game does <em>not</em> have the players face 5 encounters in rapid succession, which was a basic design assumption. 3rd edition has gamebreaking exploits where players can use magic (such as Fabricate and various Wall spells) to completely wreck local economies by putting stonemasons out of business and creating sheets of iron that can be chopped up and sold to blacksmiths for infinite metal. 3.5 tried to fix some of these problems, but also introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanNickname/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanNickname/TabletopGames">CoDzilla</a>, a cleric or druid with the means to do all the magic stuff a party needs, as well as all the fighting stuff, and which also (thanks to spell bloat) can perform the specialist jobs as well as or better than any of the non-magical classes that are supposed to specialize in such things. Earlier editions also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a> for one reason or another.
</li><li> Denying (attacking your own units to prevent enemies from gaining experience and money) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em> mod Defense of the Ancients, which turned some matches into two teams doing nothing but attacking their own units, dragging the game out for hours. It eventually was modified so that a small amount of exp is still gained from a denied unit, allowing levelling to still carry on albeit at a slower rate, which is indeed part of gameplay strategy. Of course, even without making such a change, the fallibility of human reaction means that actually getting full denies is all but impossible.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena">Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</a> genre has the persistent problem of item 'misuse': Items intended to help certain roles shore up deficiencies will be adopted by characters lacking those weaknesses to become even stronger. The same goes for characters designed to fill holes in team capabilities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tribes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tribes">Starsiege: Tribes</a></em> was originally going to be a (relatively) slow-paced, objective-based game. Players quickly discovered the ability to "ski" via jump spamming as they run down hillsides, effectively giving them zero-friction boots that allow infantry to zoom across the game's enormous maps. Entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor">custom levels</a> were built around skiing and skiing practice to find the ultimate trajectory for maximum speed. Skiing became so common that in the sequels, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">technique was given a dedicated control and taught in tutorials</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> infantry without access to vehicles were painfully slow; eventually it was discovered that the fans on Manta hovercrafts don't kill teammates, making them improvised high-speed troop carriers. The latter was considered an exploit, so in UT3 allies are sucked into Manta jets just like enemies, but all infantry get hoverboards that allow infantry to get somewhere in a more reasonable amount of time by themselves, but can also grapple friendly vehicles for a greater boost. In addition, players cannot use their weapons on the hoverboard and any damage will knock them off the boards and stun them, so they're less useful in actual combat than the passengers on the Manta were.
</li><li> In <em>Tetris Splash</em>, <em>Tetris Friends</em>, and many other newer <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> games, the "marathon" mode uses a variable goal system, in which more line clears will subtract more goal units (a single will take off 1 unit, but a Tetris takes off <em>eight</em>), resulting in lower line clears, especially line clears chained together, yielding more points per goal unit, as demonstrated <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISANNTEf3J0">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In other words: continously making Tetrises <em>actually hurts your score.</em> This is taken to an extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuyoPuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuyoPuyo">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a></em>, where the best strategy to win against other players isn't to make Tetrises, but to make a hole that's four squares wide while topping the other parts of the screen and then filling that hole in, one line at a time.
<ul><li> The classic NES version has the opposite, where Tetrises are worth so much more that getting anything besides Tetrises will lead to a much lower score. While this is more intuitive than the newer games (everyone loves clearing 4 lines at once!), it's more stylish and at least as skillful to have some doubles and triples in the mix.
</li><li> The NES fan game <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LJ65" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LJ65">LJ 65</a></em> tries to compromise between these play styles. In <a class="urllink" href="http://harddrop.com/wiki/LJ65#Scoring">its scoring system<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, "home runs" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingAroundTrademarks">that is,</a> Tetrises) are valuable, but not ridiculously overpowered, and combos are also valuable, home runs inside combos even more so.

This is particularly strange considering that: 1) rolls work fine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNKMillenniumFight2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNKMillenniumFight2000">in the previous game in the series</a>, as well as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">KOF</a></em> series practically half a decade before; 2) rolls are a feature from SNK games, but rolling is available in 2 Capcom grooves despite being absent in the corresponding games, but only 1 SNK groove.

To prevent combos from getting even longer than they already are, these cancels are classified as super moves and require charging up the Tension/Heat Gauge first. This also balances out the bottom parts of the cast and makes them more competitive against the top tier, oddly enough.

Since there are only a few locations in each level that allow you to get that big-spin-into-special grind, and since that special grind must be done quite near the start of your combo (before your special bar runs out), it does place a few limitations on the lines a player can take to get a high score.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, one of the more common complaints from the players was a lack of fresh mission content. In response, the developers created the Architect system, allowing the players to create their own missions. Unfortunately, the greater majority of the missions that were created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul">ended up as XP farms</a>. Players could bring a character from level 1 to level 50 (the level limit) in a day... after which they tended to complain about the lack of things to do.

You start the score doubler a hair after a note's normal time and play the note right after activating it, giving one extra note for the score doubler to work. If you want to get to the top of the high score tables, it's practically required.
</li><li> If a tie happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JumpSuperStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JumpSuperStars">Jump Ultimate Stars</a></em>, the players who tied are considered both winners. What does this mean? That in online play, what was supposed to be a fast paced fighting game became a borefest of people standing around waiting for the timer to end while going 3-vs-1 on anyone willing to fight, all so they can get the victory.
<ul><li> This is actually less stupid than it seems, because winning nets you gems, the in-game currency, which the game doesn't provide you enough of; it's actually the easiest money grind.

However, most players discovered that simply shoving zombies to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a> not only saved on ammo, but it also shoved zombies out of your way so you could get away. When this became commonplace in VS mode, infected players grew frustrated that they couldn't fight back against survivor players that shoved them to death. This was remedied with a patch that introduced a cool down for constant shoving and was used for the sequel as well.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> has the rushing tactic for VS mode. It's not an illegal tactic and many crescendo events are based on running from point A to point B, but players quickly found out that simply running without stopping unless they really had to made it extremely difficult for the infected players to even keep up with them. This is also exacerbated by the fact that players in VS mode won't bother going off the beaten path to look for supplies in order to prevent the infected team from attacking them.

That is, until players found their first tents. Now the servers are filled with "camps" full of hoarded high-grade loot that can fully arm a newly-created character without them ever even seeing a zombie and can put a dead player right back on their feet at full power with no more than a 15-minute run through the woods. Needless to say, several players have found the "endgame" to be less than stressful.

(Each ingredient has up to four possible effects.) The strength of the potion is determined by the quality of the alchemical equipment you use (mortal &amp; pestle, alembic, retort, etc.) as well as your Intelligence attribute. Potions can be brewed which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">raise the Intelligence attribute</a></em>. You see the problem? By purchasing large quantities of Intelligence-boosting ingredients, using them to make a potion which increases your Intelligence, drinking the potion, making <em>another</em> potion, and then repeating, you can end up with an Intelligence in the <em>tens of thousands</em>. At that point, you can create other potions with whatever effects you desire which will give you massive boosts over extremely long periods of time. You can, for example, boost your Agility to the point where no enemies can hit you while your attacks always land.

<ul><li> In at least the Color Computer version, when faced with a button on the opposite side of a wall, you can put something in your robot's grip, take hold of that item and then simply shove the robot through the wall to reach and activate the button. You can even use the same tactic to drop a robot further on into a puzzle than where you're intended to start.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> has had a few of cases of gameplay derailment in its history:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> had people come up with creative ways to farm for drops by mobs, but once skeletons and zombies were able to spawn in with their equipment being a rare drop, players focused more on mob traps to score the rare items without having to bother to hunt for the materials to create the same items. A few patches adjusted the rare drop mechanic where now all dropped equipment by mobs will be heavily worn down. Needless to say, the popularity of resource farms went right back up after the nerf. Due to the simplistic way <em>Minecraft</em> implements many of its core features, disabling or removing farms is nearly impossible.
</li><li> On the "anarchy server" 2b2t, combat is completely unrecognizable due to numerous hacks and glitches exploited by players. First, numerous duplication exploits have created almost unlimited amounts of every rare item in the game, devaluing them, as well as allowing strategies that wouldn't be viable in vanilla minecraft due to the rarity of the items needed. The dominant form of combat involves placing "end crystals" near players in order to cause large explosions, damaging them much faster than normal minecraft combat. Previously, players had also managed to create weapons that were so powerful they could one-hit kill anyone, before this was patched.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> had a special event on Ilum that put several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> quests in a free-for-all PvP area, possibly to drum up more interest on PvP. Well, in a matter of <em>hours</em> players realized that there was no additional reward for attacking other players, aside from the dubious joys of ganking and griefing. Furthermore, doing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> quests were <em>much easier</em> in the PvP area. Cue some server-wide "truces" in the PvP area with Imperial and Republic players cooperating on the daily quests, orderly lines forming for an orb drop-off puzzle, and some of the PvP heavy guilds on <em>both</em> Republic and Imperial sides coming out of it with nasty reputations for breaking said truce.
</li><li> In the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em>, players can exploit a bug involving using the item chest and grenade launcher rounds in Jill's game that can generate well over two hundred grenades for your blasting pleasure. Not only does this obviously negate the issue of limited ammo, which effectively eliminates the inventory management aspect of the game and makes just about any other weapon unnecessary, but doing this exploit with flame rounds means that you will never worry about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Crimson</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Heads</a> again. This bug was eliminated in the PAL version.
</li><li> Drift and drag events in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a>: Pro Street</em>. To win a drift event, you need to drift as usual, then steer into the wall and grind alongside it, which is considered a massive drift. Its drag events are about which cars can start the race in 4th or 5th gear, which you can achieve by buying upgrade parts to increase the length of various suspension tuning sliders, then setting the sliders just right and then downgrading them back to stock parts. Other games have similar problems: <em>GRID</em> freestyle drift events are won by finding a container and drifting in a circle around it for a couple of minutes, while drift events in the sequel are won by snaking on straights.

Twice. In a row. Even with notable rule changes. Eurisko could have done it a third time, but Lenat decided to retire it from the tournament, since if the program had won a 3rd time, it would be the last such tournament.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> Praxis Points are normally hard to come by. However, there's a fairly easy computer hacking glitch (best used with Adam's computer) that can be done as early as after finishing the Factory mission if you have the right augs for as much EXP as you want. Hack the computer, exit to the pause menu once the Access Granted message appears, load a save (preferably just before you started the first hack), hack it again and repeat as many times as you like. The five hundred EXP adds up each time, only limited by your patience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> has the Rats heist, which is a three-day mission where you have to cook meth on the first day to get information from a gang in the second day, and use said information to be able to defuse the C4 on the third day so you can get the money on a bus without the whole thing exploding in your face. Normally, cooking a lot of meth to get extra cash on the second day and getting all the money bags in the third would get you tons of money. However, after a patch gave an experience boost to multi-day heists, players quickly discovered that Rats gives nearly 300,000 experience points regardless of whether you cook the meth or blow up the lab by botching the cooking. The end result caused swarms of players farming the Rats heist by speedrunning it (blow up the lab, get or don't get the info, then kill the enemy gang in the last day and leave) so they can easily level up with minimal effort. The swarms of Rats farmers, however, also frustrate other players who want to play the heist the proper way. A later patch changed experience gains to be based off of objectives completed, with a <em>huge</em> bonus for cooking all 7 batches of meth, causing many players to slow right back down and cook once more.
</li><li> Some fan levels of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarbleBlastGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarbleBlastGold">Marble Blast Gold</a></em> require glitches or gameplay tactics that the game's built-in levels do not exploit, such as glitching through walls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump">Wall Jump</a>, using several powerups in a combination, etc.

Unless you compensate with fiendish intelligence. (Like: getting indestructible cars that you aren't supposed to. Or: getting your "assistant" - more like bullet magnet - out of harm's way. Or: building traffic barricades for your enemy beforehand.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaddenNFL">Madden NFL</a></em>, gamers quickly learned that the AI treats players differently depending on where they are lined up in the formation. This can lead to some mismatches that can be easily exploited. Two notable ones are substituting in a wide receiver or halfback in the QB position. The defense would still stay in their zones, respecting a non-existent pass threat, while the speedy player scorched around the outside for a big gain. Another is subbing wide receivers in as tight ends, because they often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningless">block just as well on running plays</a> and the AI can't jam them at the line. The former was eventually fixed by substitution restrictions, the latter remains an issue.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> series has a long and storied history of each game having some form of massive gameplay derailment - often from an unintended consequence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">Design-It-Yourself Equipment</a> - which is rectified with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> in the sequel:

</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattleBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattleBots">BattleBots</a></em> series on TV was great, with robots being smashed to pieces everywhere. As the series rolled on however, due to the way points were scored, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">wedges</a> became so prevalent that most fights ended up being two-wheeled ramps repeatedly jumping over each other, taking the "battle" out of "BattleBots".
<ul><li> Ironically, the opposite ended up happening when the show was revived in 2015. Over the years, engineering skill had improved drastically, resulting in more and more powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning">spinner-armed robots</a>, until spinners became first the predominant weapon on the show, then effectively the <em>only</em> weapon worth using (not helped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">the showrunners completely banning wedges and changing the scoring rules to make damage done with an "active weapon" the be-all and end-all</a>). By the middle of the 2018 series, only <em>one</em> robot out of every one in the top 16 (the box flipper Bronco) was <em>not</em> armed with some kind of spinning weapon,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3716v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3716v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3716v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">admittedly SawBlaze was armed with a circular saw blade rather than an impact damage weapon like a bar, disc, or drum spinner</span> and it was knocked out in the semis. While this is good news for fans of unmitigated carnage, other fans are less happy with the loss of variety and reduced emphasis on driving skill in favour of A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"BIG HIT!"</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars">Robot Wars</a></em> experienced something similar by its seventh series. It was justified by many of the contestants, who also participated at live robotic combat venues, where flippers and wedges were the only practical weapon to use. Spinners were banned due to the arena not being spinner-proofed and axes would cause too much damage to fix between rounds. The producers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defied</a> this by the 2016 series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation">only allowing a set amount of flipper robots to participate</a> alongside axe and spinner robots. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The series still ended up being won by a flipper.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Want to play fan-made levels for <em>Supaplex</em>? Read everything you can about glitches (typically called "tricks" in the fandom) or you'll find most of them unsolvable. Taken to a ridiculous extreme in levelsets like D77 and D78, where most level solutions don't even <em>resemble</em> normal gameplay. To add insult to the injury, some of these glitches require frame-perfect timing. Many of these levels require several such tricks in a row. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">There is no saving in this game.</a> Thankfully, most versions of the game offer variable speed, so the game can be slowed down. It's still really freaking hard, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> speedrunning:
<ul><li> Competitive speedrunning in the Genesis-era <em>Sonic</em> games often eschews "normal" gameplay in favor of strange glitches, most of which involve getting stuck in a wall and then zipping across the entire level. These glitches tend to be really difficult to perform. Basic skill still counts, though and being good <em>only</em> at the glitches will not make you competition-worthy.
</li><li> The Genesis <em>Sonic</em> games also give hefty point bonuses for completing levels quickly&mdash;then take an ironically long time tallying those points. Competitive speedrunners may deliberately waste a few seconds before finishing a level, because getting fewer bonus points actually saves time overall. To discourage that behavior, some speedrun leaderboards only count <em>in-level</em> time, rather than realtime.
</li></ul></li><li> Zigzagged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipsChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipsChallenge">Chip's Challenge</a></em>; due to the shoddy programming of the original Windows port, fan-made levels often exploit level design glitches that aren't possible in most other versions of the game (such as cloning keys/boots or hiding objects underneath floor tiles). When the engine was rebuilt for the remake/sequel, the designers decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a>, to the point where such design gimmicks are utilized in several of the sequel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">official levels</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius">G-Darius</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> sequences are done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtonMashing">rapidly tapping the fire button</a> to make the player's beam outgrow the enemy's...but in practice, players just use automatic rapid fire buttons (either rapid-fire buttons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">installed onto arcade cabinets by the operator</a> or third-party controllers on consoles) that defeat the purpose of the gimmick. This is perhaps why <em>Dariusburst</em> uses timing-based elements instead for counterattacking enemy beams.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a>:
<ul><li> Holding a ball on a raised flipper was unheard of until roughly 1990. This simple but completely game-changing strategy threw multiball modes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note438ef');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note438ef" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note438ef');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">modes where 2 or more balls are in play at the same time</span> completely off whack, since you can safely hold one ball on a flipper while playing the remaining ball(s) with the other flipper. Machines made after the discovery structure their multiballs with this tactic in mind.
</li><li> There have been plenty of machines with modes where the objective is to merely survive until the timer runs out, and you are then rewarded with points, the idea being that you can lose at any moment and you must be skilled to keep flipping and shooting the whole time. Again, holding a ball on a raised flipper wreaks havoc with these objectives, as players end up just keeping the ball there and sitting out the timer. It wasn't a big deal until pinball competitions were commonly streamed, when audiences found this strategy utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">boring</a>. Post-streaming machines have done away with this sort of objective completely, either by freezing the timer if the machine detects no activity or requiring at least one shot to complete the objective.
</li></ul></li><li> Gold farming exploits have always been prevalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em>, from selling items for more than you bought them for in the first game, to buying massive amounts of property and farming rent payments in the second. Most players will probably spend more time becoming scam artists and real estate tycoons than they do adventuring. <em>Fable 3</em> did nothing to fix this, with exploiting the real estate market being the only way for good players to achieve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>. Building a personal fortune of over 1 million gold and funding the army yourself is the only way to keep your promises.
</li><li> There is an in-canon example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>, in which it is revealed that Haymitch killed his final opponent by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatIAimedAt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatIAimedAt">bouncing a thrown axe</a> off the force-field around the arena, which neither the tributes nor the audience were meant to know about.
</li><li> In a sports example, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/how-david-beats-goliath">when Vivek Ranadiv&eacute; coached his daughter's basketball team<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, he had the team compensate for somewhat marginal physical ability and training by having them constantly employ a full-court press defense <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5afvq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5afvq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5afvq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In basketball, the conventional defense is to run back to your half of the field and just defend the area in front of the basket. A full-court press is when you block the opposing team all across the court</span>, contesting inbound passes <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6nh7q');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6nh7q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6nh7q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the throw-in after a basket is made</span> and mobbing the ball-holder on the back court to keep them from ever getting onto their side. This strategy proved so overwhelmingly powerful <a class="urllink" href="http://rushthecourt.net/2009/05/05/gladwells-theory-on-full-court-pressure-is-the-only-outlier-here/">against relatively unskilled 12-year-old girls by their even less skilled peers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, that it took a mostly-rookie team to the national championships, but it also <em>enraged</em> Ranadiv&eacute;'s opposing coaches and referees friendly to them, and they eventually were forced to abandon it by a referee who disproportionately weighted his foul calls against them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CHUNITHM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CHUNITHM">CHUNITHM</a></em> features Air notes, in addition to "ground" notes that have to be hit on the slider. Air notes are hit by lifting the player's hand up into the air through an infrared sensor placed above the slider. In theory, the player's hand is meant to match the horizontal positioning of Air notes, much like with ground notes, and when there are two or more Air notes to hit at the same time, the player is meant to lift for both notes. However, the Air sensor can only detect that something is blocking it, not how many objects are blocking it or where, so in practice, many players just lift only one hand to trigger all relevant Air notes at once.
</li><li> The popular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> II</em> scenario <em>World of Jules Verne</em> has an example in the form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheWorlds">Martian death walker</a>. It was designed to be a temporary, formally unstoppable threat that would wreak havoc and vanish quickly, leaving the victim civ to rebuild in its wake. Towards this end, the unit has damage and armor as close to infinite as the game engine allows. However, a Spy unit with insanely good luck can turn the unit, putting you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">at the helm of an invincible alien steamroller</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em>, an exploit called "gacha" (not to be confused with mobile game rare-item/character lotteries known as <em>gacha</em>) involves the player downshifting to a previous gear and taking advantage of its very brief burst of acceleration before shifting back up (for example, if you're supposed to be in 4th gear, you shift down to 3rd and quickly back up to 4th). Not only is this an unintended way of playing, but it can also <em>damage the shifter</em> thus ruining the game for other customers, so from <em>Maximum Tune 2</em> onwards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">attempting to gacha will force your gear into neutral</a>.
</li><li> A non-gaming example. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a> was first introduced on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> in 1981, the rules stated that the contestant was given a blank puzzle, and had to pick five consonants and a vowel to assist in solving the puzzle within a 15-second time limit. Most contestants picked some permutation of R, S, T, L, N, and E, occasionally swapping out H or D. This went on for seven years before they just started giving RSTLNE automatically, and prompting the contestant for three more consonants and a vowel &#151; while also making the puzzles a bit less reliant on common letters (it's rare for RSTLNE to reveal so much as half of the answer) and slashing the time limit to 10 seconds.
<ul><li> Another example from the same show. The "Same Name" category (two names, phrases, etc. joined because they end in the same word; e.g. "BAKING &amp; CREAM SODA" or "DENZEL &amp; GEORGE WASHINGTON") originally spelled out the word AND, thus leading to nearly every contestant calling N and D, then buying A right out of the gate. The puzzle writers were quick to catch on, and swapped out the word for an ampersand. Oddly, this got inverted in the 2000s, as Same Name began reverting to AND with increasing frequency.
</li><li> Defied with the "What Are You Doing?" category, where the answer almost always ends in -ING. They seem more than happy to let contestants always go N-G-I first.
</li></ul></li><li> Another non-gaming example occurs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>, and is known as the "Forrest Bounce" (after Chuck Forrest, the first notable contestant to use it as a gameplay strategy). While most contestants pick clues top-to-bottom, some over the years have found that it can be beneficial to select clues further down the board or randomly bounce between categories &mdash; the idea being that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusSpace">Daily Double</a> usually hides near the bottom of the board, and getting a bunch of lower-box clues correct can beef up one's score in a hurry due to their higher value. The strategy really took off when champion Arthur Chu used it to his advantage, which led to a marked increase in Forrest bouncing by subsequent contestants. However, host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek">Alex Trebek</a> has said that he doesn't find it a worthwhile strategy, since it often leads to contestants hitting the Daily Double too early and thus having too little to wager on it, or failing to pick up on the theme of a category by starting near the bottom or bouncing around.
<ul><li> Chu was also responsible for one tactic that ended up getting an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>: many times during his run, he wagered to tie on Final Jeopardy!, so that a victory meant that he would be co-champion with another contestant, and thus deal with only one unknown on the next episode instead of two. This occurred so many times during his run that the show changed the rules, requiring a tiebreaker clue to be played should a tie for first place occur after the Final Jeopardy! round (which was previously the case only in tournaments). Surprisingly, it took several years for the "tiebreaker clue" rule to actually be invoked during regular play.
</li></ul></li><li> Twice in <em>Old School <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>. The first is prayer flicking, which is activating a protection prayer active on the same tick<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note70wuu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note70wuu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note70wuu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">0.6 seconds</span> an attack is considered "active" to negate the damage, then turning it off the very next one. This strategy is so effective that it actually turned very hard bosses into a much easier fight, and had Jagex require future bosses target tiles with some of their attacks to provide some semblance of challenge without entering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> territory by removing tells on monsters with multiple attack styles. This notably was around even in RS2, before Evolution of Combat (where it doesn't work due to the nerf to protection prayers) was created, let alone implemented, but a lack of understanding the game's mechanics made it very uncommon and more a gimmick.
<ul><li> The second is tick eating, or eating immediately after damage is registered, but before the game registers you as dead. Due to a quirk in how the game handles HP, you'll never drop below zero HP, meaning you're effectively immortal as long as your food stack lasts. Jagex has done nothing about this, however, due to the fact that it's so impossibly hard even while standing still, let alone while being able to fight back. There's only <em><strong>one player</strong></em> that's able to consistently do it in actual combat, and even then he's not capable of beating the hardest bosses in the game 100% of the time with it. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/306014487">It has to be seen to be believed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The board game <em>Eclipse</em> had an infamous gameplay derailment related to Plasma Missiles. They created the Missile Frigate strategy, a player who loads their ship entirely with Plasma Missiles and Targetting Computers; such a ship is technically very vulnerable, but never takes damage because the Missiles fire before any other combat phase and wipe the opponent out before their damage can be dealt. The only counter to this strategy is to fill a ship with armor plating and only a small number of weapons, but this requires so many resources it will likely cause both the Missile Frigate player and the armored ship player to lose to players who are not involved in this deadlock. This means that the majority of the game is about making sure that players are in a position to prevent Missile Frigates being played.
</li><li> The board game <em>Chameleon</em> is derailed entirely in standard gameplay by a glitch in the rules. If a player needs only one point to win, mindlessly accusing them of being the Chameleon every round regardless of clues will always prevent them doing so. This is resolved if a second player reaches that position, but this means players want to avoid being the first in a winning position, creating a Prisoner's Dilemma.
</li><li> In Burgle My Banana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GiantBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GiantBomb">Giant Bomb's</a> gambling-infused playthrough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em>, players were awarded with a spin of a roulette wheel each time they collected a coin. The rarity of coins was vastly overestimated and players quickly found that coin hunting was a more profitable venture than actually progressing through the game; each task completed only provided a single banana, the metagame's currency, whereas a spin of the wheel could grant many.
