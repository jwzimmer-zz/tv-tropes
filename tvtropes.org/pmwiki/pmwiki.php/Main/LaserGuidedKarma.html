</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule">The Golden Rule</a> states, <em>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you</em>, but in fiction, the rule seems to be more, <em>What you do unto others will be done unto you.</em> If you mistreat the people and things around you, karma will strike you down. Treat them well, and you will be rewarded. Accordingly, every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">notable</a> act of a fictional person will yield a meaningful return before the end of the story; every little action, good or bad, will be repaid in kind with the accuracy of a laser-guided missile. Whether its payload is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">sunshine and puppies</a> (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">painful irony</a> (also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a>) depends on whether Bob was a saint or a bastard.

It also undermines the standard "do good for goodness' sake" lesson, since Bob never has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">suffer for doing the right thing</a> or accept virtue as its own reward &mdash; in Fictionland he always gets repaid.

</li><li> Cornelius Fudge spent an entire year denying that Voldemort was back, and set up an entire smear campaign against Harry, Dumbledore, and their supporters to disgrace them and to destroy their reputations. Once it turns out that Voldemort really had returned, all of the slander he aimed at his "enemies" turned around and bit him in the ass. The entire wizarding community now sees him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>, so he gets fired in disgrace and his reputation is destroyed, and he's going down in history as one of the worst Ministers of Magic ever.

Because of that karmic revelation, Dudley changes his ways.

</li><li> In <em>The Bestseller</em> Daniel goes to massive lengths to "prove" he wrote a major novel when his wife Judith did all the work. The novel turns out to be a huge flop and Daniel's insistence on taking sole credit means he gets sole blame.

He got to set a trap for Bluestar at the edge of the Thunderpath with the intention of killing her, but Cinderpelt ended up investigating the Thunderpath and getting hit by a car, which permanently damaged one of her legs and dashed her hopes of ever being a Warrior. Before that, in Into The Wild, he killed Redtail, ThunderClan's deputy at the time. Not many moons after that, he learned that Ravenpaw, his apprentice saw what happened, and Tigerstar tries to turn the clan against Ravenpaw and planned to kill him to make sure he stayed silent. In Forest of Secrets, he led a group of rouges in an attack against ThunderClan, and he surely would've killed Bluestar if Firestar hadn't been present. In A Dangerous Path, he led a pack of dogs to Snakerocks, which ended up killing one apprentice and disfiguring another as well as killing another cat to give the dogs a taste for cat blood. It all came to a head In Darkest Hour when he wanted to unite the clans as one(which is a lot worse than it sounds) under his leadership. He managed to get RiverClan to join "TigerClan" and tried to get Graystripe's kits killed by having Stonefur, Bluestar's son, to kill them. When Stonefur refused, he sic'd Darkstripe on him, and when it looked like Darkstripe was going to lose, Tigerstar got another one of his followers to kill Stonefur. And after his betrayal, Bluestar completely lost her mind, which made her stop caring about her Clan. While his death at the hands of Scourge wasn't one that any sane cat would wish on another, you have to admit that after all that happened he really deserved to die. In fact, Tigerstar was so despised, that his son carried the suspicions of his Clanmates.

</li><li> There is an Irish folktale called <em>The Hunchback and the Elves</em> where a hunchback happens upon a gathering of elves; because he is kind to them, they reward him by removing his hunch. He tells another hunchback, who also visits the elves, shows them kindness, and is rewarded the same way. A third hunchback visits the elves but tries to steal their treasure and instead of being rewarded, the elves give him the other two hunchbacks' hunches in addition to one he already had.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> also hints in a few places that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> reward and punish proportionally, though exactly how the rewards and punishments are proportioned is not explained.
</li><li> The story of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">Androcles and the Lion</a>" is a good example. In most versions of the story, a Roman fugitive slave named Androcles takes refuge in a cave and finds a lion wounded by a thorn in its paw. He removes the thorn and cleans the infected wound, nursing the beast back to health. Years later, Androcles returns to civilization, only to be arrested and condemned to be devoured by the wild beasts in the Circus Maximus, the usual punishment for a fugitive slave. The emperor (presumably either Caligula or Claudius) shows up to watch, and as fate would have it, the most vicious beast that is sprung upon Androcles is the same lion that he healed, who remembers and shows affection toward him. The emperor is impressed by the display, pardons him, and gives him custody of the lion.
</li><li> Some might say it's subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a> because most times karma is just the gods helping or messing with the heroes, but the fact is that the heroes' good or bad actions have consequences, and the gods represent universal forces, so this is still technically true. Here are some examples:
<ul><li> Achilles's profanation of Apollo's temple led to his death by Paris, who was a servant of Apollo.
</li><li> Depending on the version, Apollo cursed Cassandra that her prophecies may never be believed because she lied to him to get her power in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">In some versions, though, it was just because she rejected his sexual advances.</a>
</li><li> Odysseus blinding Polyphemus was what incited Poseidon to curse him, setting the stage for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>.
<ul><li> Other examples include the greed of Odysseus' crew leading to Aeolus' gift blowing them off course, the plunder at Ismaros being rewarded by storms that blew them off course, and Odysseus' patience and faithfulness at Calypso's island leading to divine intervention aiding his escape. On the other hand, Odysseus only put out Polyphemus' eye because the cyclops meant to eat him, so they were kind of holding each others' lasers. Odysseus' tribulations are as much because of hubris as anything else because he would have gotten away with blinding Polyphemus if he hadn't decided to boast by shouting his real name at the monster as he left. Polyphemus initially offered to feast <em>with</em> Odysseus instead of <em>on</em> Odysseus in his honor for his cunning; it was only after Odysseus cursed him that Polyphemus cursed him back.
</li></ul></li><li> On top of that, the vast majority of Greek kings and leaders ended up reaping the karmic rewards for massacring the Trojans that attempted to seek sanctuary in the temples of the gods.
</li><li> Jason helping an old woman across a stream was fortuitous, for she was actually Hera in disguise, and she set in motion the events that led to his later adventures with the Argonauts.
<ul><li> Jason would suffer both good <em>and</em> bad karma with this trope, as his efforts to dump his lawful wife Medea (who had allowed the Argonauts to escape the land of her father Aeetes) for another woman cost him Hera's favor and led to his disgrace and eventual death.
</li><li> Jason's betrayal was a case of Laser-Guided Karma for Medea, who betrayed her father, murdered her brother, and later tricked the daughters of Jason's uncle into murdering their father.
</li><li> Her father was actively trying to murder (indirectly) Jason using undead skeletons and an unkillable dragon. His uncle was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> despot who murdered Jason's father and stole his throne and was ALSO trying to get Jason killed indirectly. Her brother... was just kinda in the way, and his murder forced her father to stop his pursuit of Jason to bury him. Alternately, there are versions where her brother's death was an accident.
</li></ul></li><li> Ixion is another mention, given that he first murdered his father-in-law, fled to Mount Olympus to escape punishment, and repaid Zeus's hospitality by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">attempting to rape Hera</a></em> (and only sort of succeeded, he raped a cloud nymph in the form of Hera from which the centaurs were born). An infuriated Zeus banished him to Hades, where he was strapped to a flaming wheel and left to spin around for the rest of eternity.
<ul><li> Ixion's son Peirithoos is just as bad, convincing Theseus to sneak down with him into Hades and kidnap Persephone to be his bride. Needless to say, Hades was not amused. When Heracles came down to the Underworld on the last of his Twelve Labours, he was allowed to free Theseus from Hades' captivity. The Underworld shook when he tried to free Peirithoos, which was Hades' way of letting our hero know that this was a <em>very</em> bad idea.
</li></ul></li><li> Tantalus was a king who tried to steal some ambrosia from the gods. They found out and banished him from Olympus. He invited them to a feast at his home to "try to make it up to them"; he killed his children and fed them to the gods to prove that they weren't all-knowing as revenge for being banished. They found out about that, too [they are gods, after all] and now he's in the Fields Of Punishment. He's standing in a lake under a fruit tree, and he's starving. Every time he tries to eat or drink, the food/liquid moves away from him.
</li><li> Sisyphus' attempts to cheat death (and by extension Hades) ended in failure and got him stuck pushing a boulder up a mountain for eternity.
</li><li> The moral of these stories? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">Don't piss off the Greek gods</a></em>.
</li><li> That said, though they are the main forces of karma in Greek myth, not even the Olympians themselves could escape karmic retribution for some of their particularly loathsome actions. The deity who suffered from this most often was Hera, whenever she tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">kill one of Zeus' many children when they were babies</a> they would always live either via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Zeus saving them</a> or just fate itself ensuring they would survive, and they would almost always become either a great hero or come up to Olympus to become a god much to the fury and humiliation of Hera.
<ul><li> Hephaestus is easily one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">easygoing and friendly gods</a> on Olympus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">but not even he can tolerate adultery</a>. When his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveGoddess">Aphrodite</a> cheated on him in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">Ares,</a> Hephaestus caught them in an unbreakable net whilst they were having sex and dragged them in front of the other gods who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">pointed and laughed at the two adulterers</a>.
</li><li> In some versions, Sisyphus' final fate does not bother him at all and he actually finds solace in pushing the boulder since it gives him time to himself to think for all eternity. For all the gods involved, this is a source of unending frustration for having one mortal they were never able to humble.
</li><li> Even before the Olympians and mortals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldGods">the primordial gods and titans</a> were not immune to karma.

<ul><li> The hordes of nightmarish Ghost People are victims of karma. The entire construction crew that was building the Villa around the Casino was pulling a scam; they were cutting every corner possible to make the flimsiest, least safe town ever constructed, and saving a ton of money in the process. Partially as a result of their shoddy construction, a dangerous toxic cloud began building up in the ventilation systems. After the bombs fell, with no one to turn off or repair the vents, the Cloud spewed out unstopped for centuries, and the construction workers can be found shambling around the Villa in a horrid parody of life, still wearing their hazmat suits.

One of them being the hazmat suits which were made of an experimental material and could seal people inside them because contact with the cloud quickly corroded the seals. This means the workers who were trapped in the cloud were unable to get out of the suits because of the client having to get back money that the workers displaced.

At one point Takahata has been incapped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaiserNeko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaiserNeko">KaiserNeko</a> asks if anyone wants to help him. Lani just says he's shooting Taka. A Charger then attacks Lani. Later, Ganxingba gets trapped by fire and Lani decides to throw a gas can and a propane tank to make it worse. He's then grabbed by a smoker. In both instances, he calls it karma.

Towards the end of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krC7HTp-H80&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=12m31s">the first part of Luigi's Engine Room<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, when Jon gets a Poison Mushroom, Chugga chimes in with this:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Chugga:</strong> Hey, Jon. Hey, Jon. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnyttStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnyttStories">Don't eat the mushroom</a>. <br><strong>Jon:</strong> ...I hate your face. <br><em>*Chugga laughs, NCS groans*</em> <br><strong>NCS:</strong> Man, talk about perfect timing! <br><strong>Chugga:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAlwaysWantedToSayThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAlwaysWantedToSayThat">I was saving that joke!</a> <br><strong>Jon:</strong> I like how you scripted jokes for&mdash; to say&mdash; <br><strong>Chugga:</strong> Well, I just thought of it on the plane! <br><strong>Jon:</strong> You thought of it on the wa&mdash; You <em>literally</em> have thought of this for <em>days</em>! You've been waiting <em>days</em> to make a "Don't eat the mushroom" reference! <br><strong>Chugga:</strong> Well, I guess I knew it would bug you! I knew it would bug you, that's why I did it.
</div><ul><li> One turn later, Chugga gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Warp Block</a> ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">NOOOOOO!</a>"), switches places with Jon ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">NOOOOOO!</a>"), and also gets a poison mushroom ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">NOOOOOO!</a>").

NCS dies and loses a life, but Chuuga just barely manages to fly back up in time. Even though Chugga is playing Kirby and him dying would force all three to restart the level, Jon starts getting exceptionally trollish and is upset that Chugga survived, wishing that he'd also fallen to his death while making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">Dead Artists Are Better</a> joke, all to Chugga's annoyance. Immediately after this happens, Jon flies too low and crashes into a platform made of lava, causing him to fall to his death.

</li><li> Back in 2008 during the midnight launch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Brawl</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ScrewAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/ScrewAttack">ScrewAttack</a> members Craig and Ben went to their local Gamestop to auction off an early copy of the game they had received, with the proceeds going to charity. At one point a customer in line for the game objected to having his face on camera and angrily ordered them to turn it off. (His face was edited out with a paper bag with a frowny face reading "I don't want my face on camera".) Eventually, he accused them of assault and called the cops. When they showed up and the guys gave their side of the story, the cops turned around and arrested the guy who called them.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter">Achievement Hunter</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>, a lot of the gang gets hit with this constantly. Incidents include Jack getting ran over by a truck twice after he reveals that he refused to help Ray with being attacked by a dog, Ray getting attacked by a dog for taunting Jack over being run over by the truck, and Michael getting attacked by a dog when he says that the dogs were attacking him because he was Puerto Rican.
<ul><li> This has been a thing with the AH Let's Plays, especially with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries">Let's Play Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> series as Ryan enjoys being a dick and trying to mow down everyone during certain events (especially the Heist episodes). Karma will usually come back and bite him hard.
</li><li> A particularly poignant example is in their Let's Play of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UFHlh1kzvs">Bidiots<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Jeremy, already lined up to make a modest profit on one of his drawings but looking to make a couple extra bucks, bids up his own drawing then sneakily tries to use a Screw to force someone else to outbid him. This would have worked fine<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3mlj9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3mlj9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3mlj9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ryan had used this exact strategy successfully the previous round, giving him the idea.</span> if the person he chose to Screw hadn't been Gavin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">who had already been Screwed into purchasing several other drawings already</a>, leaving him nearly broke and unable to top Jeremy's bid, invalidating the Screw. As a result, Jeremy's Screw is throw out and, with no one lifting a finger to bail him out, Jeremy is forced to buy his own artwork for an exorbitant amount while also forfeiting his artist's commission for the drawing.
</li><li> In their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries">Let's Play Minecraft</a></em> videos, this is present all the time. Examples include

Gavin is the first to place a piece of the tower and is in the lead since no one else has placed a piece or is even close to making their first one. After dying and losing his map, he decides to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Michael</a>, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Ray</a>, but neither of them had any maps. So he then decides to attack Geoff... who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">proceeds</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">kick</a> Gavin's ass in real life, and then, for good measure, steals the gold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">Gavin</a> was carrying with him. Gavin continues to mine for materials (and gold) to renew his attack Geoff, only to die each time and lose more gold he had mined, inadvertently giving Geoff the win. Which is then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Geoff.
</li></ul></li><li> There was also the time where AH and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FunHaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FunHaus">Fun Haus</a> played a few rounds of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Smite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Smite">Smite</a></em> with FH not realizing that AH swapped out their usual team in favor of their more video game-competent "B Team", creaming them.

</li><li> Many episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperMarioLogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperMarioLogan">SuperMarioLogan</a></em> have Bowser Junior do something bad and try to cover it up, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">fail miserably</a>. One notable example is in the episode, "Bowser Junior's Clown Car!", wherein Junior breaks a table with Bowser's old clown car and gets sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySchool">Military School</a> for it.

After winning Clara over, they end up having a lot of problems in their relationship and it's implied that he was miserable with Clara for months and cheated on her constantly as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>: A grander example than usual. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The man who would become known as Ozpin</span> failed to stop Salem's evil plots. The gods therefore cursed him to keep fighting her, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">forever</a></em>. Thousands of years later, he considers this a perfectly fitting punishment. Of course, as with everything else regarding this character, it turns out to be quite a bit more complicated than he claimed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ozma was Salem's lover until he died of a mundane disease. Salem entreated the gods to resurrect him, and even tricked them into doing so briefly, but was punished for her hubris with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a>. When she raised a rebellion against the gods, she was punished further by having <em>all of humanity</em> wiped out, leaving her alone. It was only when humanity managed to return, in a lesser state, that Ozma was pulled from the afterlife and given the opportunity to redeem humanity. He was reincarnated, found Salem, and they raised a family together. But when he realized that Salem planned to start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace">Master Race</a> of their children and kill everyone else, he tried to take the children away. Ozma and Salem fought, the children died, and Ozma was reincarnated again</span>. So while it was a <em>karmic</em> punishment, it wasn't really as simple as the gods directly punishing him for his mistakes, as he originally said.
