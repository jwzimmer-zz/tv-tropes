He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> of a story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> whose predestined role is to oppose &mdash; maybe even defeat &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVillain">The Villain</a>. Because he is essential to the plot, he can't be removed from the story until the final confrontation.
</p><p>But it wouldn't make for a good story if Bob just strolled unchallenged to his encounter with destiny, so the author has to throw dangers in his way. A <em>good</em> author can keep it from being obvious that the orc he meets on page 56 can't possibly stop Bob &mdash; not if he's going to meet Fing the Fuming on page 437. But in less skilled hands, Bob's invincibility on pages 1-436 becomes obvious. He doesn't have luck or skill; he has a suit of divine armor which <em>miraculously</em> shields him from death, serious wounds, and generally all lasting harm until the plot calls for it. Even psychological trauma can be held at bay by Bob's suit of Plot Armor.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes referred to as "Script Immunity" or a "Character Shield", Plot Armor is when a main character's life and health are safeguarded by the fact that he's the one person who can't be removed from the story. Therefore, whenever Bob is in a situation where he could be killed (or at the least very seriously injured), he comes out unharmed with no logical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> explanation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nnjf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1nnjf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nnjf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A typical explanation is that Bob survived through sheer luck on the basis of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">Anthropic Principle</a>. If only one person is going to survive the story, that person has to be Bob for there to <em>be</em> a story.</span>
</p><p>Bear in mind that having Plot Armor is not the same as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>. When Superman takes a bullet to the eye and survives, that's his superhuman nature &#151; there's an explanation, albeit a fantastic one, for how he comes out unharmed. When Indiana Jones survives the same thing, that's Plot Armor &#151; the only explanation for his survival is that it's only halfway through the movie and you know he can't die yet. (Bonus points if he isn't even blinded.)

And his inability to prevent his own death may seem just as illogical as his ability to <em>avoid</em> it was forty pages ago, but alas, the plot gods giveth and the plot gods taketh away...

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a>: Plot-mandated protection given to a particularly series-defining recurring villain.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct">Hitler's Time Travel Exemption Act</a>: Hitler has unbreakable Plot Armor, to the point where any timey-wimey attempt to assassinate him will either fail or make things even worse.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressBall">Distress Ball</a>: A character's level of danger increases, but his odds of surviving it increase even more, to get him to the scripted rescue or resolution.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Iron Butt Monkey</a>: A character repeatedly survives various improbable tortures just to be laughed at <em>because</em> he or she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterThreatExpiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterThreatExpiration">Monster Threat Expiration</a>: The villain's Plot Armor degrades over time, and/or the hero's or group of heroes' Plot Armor becomes more prominent against them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningACanOfClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningACanOfClones">Opening a Can of Clones</a>: <em>Appears</em> to remove Plot Armor but actually expands it by giving Bob any number of disposable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble">decoy bodyguards</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDrivenInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryDrivenInvulnerability">Story-Driven Invulnerability</a>: A video game boss can only be killed when the story allows it.

Not only is he back on his feet after a few days, but he is also showing <em>absolutely no signs of being shot over thirty freaking times</em> afterwards.

</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series uses it to some extent due to the general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuringTheWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuringTheWar">During the War</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> setting, with extremely few main characters ending up as casualties of plot-irrelevant battles regardless of their tactical situation. Some shows completely spare the main cast while others put the lesser heroes through the ringer (and typically only in the last few episodes, at that; if the Plot Armor gets pierced, it almost always happens in the finale). Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a> has been started by someone declaring that one of the series uses Plot Armor beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a>, while either ignoring or forgetting that the show they're currently championing does as well.

<ul><li> One common form of Plot Armor that can be seen throughout the <em>Gundam</em> franchise is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">ordinary "grunt" mobile suits</a> tend to mysteriously become a lot more durable than usual if a main character has to temporarily pilot one of them. And the reverse is also true. Whenever a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> gets put into mass production, even if it explicitly <em>isn't</em> downgraded in the process, the new ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">never do as well as the original</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>; the reason the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> won't start her plans yet is because Medaka is the main character, and thus guaranteed to defeat her if she is challenged. At which point she recruits Medaka's childhood friend Zenkichi to do it for her, and grants him an ability of his own choosing called "Devil Style" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which nullifies Zenkichi's own plot armor. First, though, she has to shift the genre of the work to make him the main character in the first place</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sasuke Uchiha has a tendency to get into fights that are beyond his ability to win, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">suddenly demonstrate a new power</a> that had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">never been seen or even hinted at before</a>, or for another villain to bail him out at the last second. And then there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">the time</a> in which Sasuke evaded certain death from an explosion by a combination of two moves that each had immense chakra requirements, despite the reason that he was in danger in the first place being that he had already used up almost all his chakra, and did so in an implausibly short amount of time.
</li><li> Madara Uchiha is a villainous version of this. Since his resurrection, Madara got in a few situations in which he was very close to defeat, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">suddenly demonstrate a new power that had never been seen or even hinted at before</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">just doing impossible actions without explanation</a>. His most iconic one may be when he was somehow knew how to terminate the contract with Edo Tensei when the person who summoned him was defeated despite the fact that even the original creator of this jutsu did not know how to do it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And as if in confirmation of this when his Plot Armor disappeared (after activation Infinite Tsukiyomi) he was defeated with literally one hit in the back from Black Zetsu which showed that he manipulated Madara all this time and to use him as fodder for Kaguya's resurrection. The plot gods giveth and the plot gods taketh away, actually...</span>
</li><li> In the final arc of the manga, over forty thousand members of the Shinobi Alliance died, which is half their total forces. Only a handful of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalImportance">had names</a>, and half of those were mostly introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">just to be killed off</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Given just how many characters there are</a>, it's a bit hard to swallow that half the army could have been killed off and hardly any of the major characters were among the casualties. The only confirmed deaths from pre-existing characters were Neji, Shikaku and Inoichi.
</li><li> In Gaara's fight with Kimimaro, he only survived literally because Kimimaro dropped dead on the spot, and even then he still should have been killed but dying completely robbed Kimimaro's attack of its momentum. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">For some reason.</a>
</li><li> <em>Naruto</em> is so bad about this trope, with Kinshimoto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">bending over backwards</a> to keep his main characters from dying, that both fans and detractors sarcastically refer to him as a master of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"Plot No Jutsu."</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Monkey D. Luffy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> sports a rather blatant form of Plot Armor, to the point where it may very well be a <em>plot point</em>. The same goes for the rest of the Straw Hat Crew, especially Zoro. Granted that he had immense strength and durability but sometimes it's kind of unbelievable. For example: When Luffy was exhausted to the point of no longer being able to move and under the danger of being nuked to hell, his severely damaged and barely functioning ship that had been abandoned <em>days prior on another island</em> drifted to his location at that exact moment and his crewmates were able to throw him on and escape. This level of plot armor extends beyond blind luck too; no matter how strong the enemies are, <em>nothing</em> will ever kill one of the Straw Hats. The crew's sharpshooter Usopp, described by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> as being supposedly only as strong as a normal person, was able to be smashed by a <em>4-ton bat</em> and <em>dragged along the ground at 40 miles an hour</em> and <em>live</em>. Truly, the Straw Hats' "limits" are at the complete whim of the plot. They can withstand <em>anything</em> short of being completely obliterated and any attack capable of doing that will simply not touch them for one reason or another. Of course, the series is known for "No One Dies in One Piece" because <em>every</em> character outside of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a> showed this sort of durability, at least <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for around 600 chapters</span>.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>. The first thing that happens is the main character gets hit by a bus, and she is brought back by the Great Will of the Macroism explicitly because she is the main character. Her boss is aware of this, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">tends to kill her when she gets too annoying</a>.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> fall into this trope (except Phoenix Ikki who can die an revive like the namesake bird). They suffer unaccounted pain and bleed like hell, but still manage to stand up and win no matter what, proving that no matter if you wear a bronze, silver or gold cloth, it's the plot armor that counts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HumanityHasDeclined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HumanityHasDeclined">Humanity Has Declined</a></em>, fairies act as plot armor, in that the number of them you meet is tied directly to how safe you are from danger.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> a few of the main characters sport some blatant Plot Armor that stops them from dying no matter what happens, even in a world where people die like flies, and even if they are not particularly skilled. The members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">104th Training Corps</a> have a knack for surviving whatever is thrown at them, while their seniors are dying all around them. Enemy barrages just happen to miss them, while others around them are reduced to very messy stains on a regular basis. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tragically, that armor comes to an end after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, with Sasha Blaus being gunned down as their squad is <em>leaving</em> the battlefield and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">celebrating</a> that they've all survived again</span>.
<ul><li> The most painfully ironic example would have to be Reiner Braun, earning him the fan nickname of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Plot Armor Titan</span>. What makes his repeated escapes from death so ironic is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he experiences <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> from the guilt of his actions, becoming a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> that repeatedly begs to simply be allowed to <em>die already</em> and be free from his suffering</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> is about everyone trying to save Earth by figuring out a way to kill Korosensei, the story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>. He has near god-like speed, regenerative abilities, immunity to poison, and is inhumanly perceptive. Whenever someone apparently drives him into a corner, he always pulls another trick up his sleeve to escape (which he keeps deeply concealed within his plot armor).
</li><li> Joseph Joestar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> is an extreme example. It's a given he would survive most of his own arc, but the first arc left the impression that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>, even the hero at the end, yet he survives. Then he joins his grandson Jotaro's ensemble for an arc full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">Sacrificial Lions</a> and averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome">Sudden Sequel Death Syndrome</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard">Mentor Occupational Hazard</a> to live through that as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> had this a lot, as not only does nobody important die, when characters <em>do</em> die or otherwise lose their souls, they always come back once the villains are defeated.
<ul><li> The Battle City Finals take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, where most characters win/lose due to plot armor, since it's obvious who will meet who in the finals. Yami Yugi is about to lose to Yami Bakura until on his very last turn he gets an Egyptian God Card. Rishid is about to win against Jonouchi, but Malik orders him to summon the copy of The Winged Dragon of Ra, resulting that Ra gets enraged and strikes both players with lightning, and Jonouchi recovers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>. Mai would have beaten Yami Malik had she just attacked, but tries to summon Ra and can't read its text, and Yami Malik uses Ra instead. Kaiba suddenly has a vision that tells him that he should use his Blue-Eyes White Dragon instead of Obelisk the Tormentor, sacrificing his Egyptian God Card, which makes Ishizu's Trap Card useless. And then in the semi-finals, Jonouchi would have defeated Yami Malik (and saved Mai as he vowed he would), but nearly dies because of the torture he had to endure in the duel. And Yami Yugi is able to save himself from losing by suddenly being able to use the effect of Kaiba's The Flute of Summoning Dragon.
</li><li> In the anime's season 5, Yugi and his friends come across Zorc's second head in the Puzzle. Despite getting directly hit by the fire, Yugi isn't injured at <em>all</em>, and neither are his friends.

<ul><li> The heroes always get their Pokemon back from Team Rocket, as does anyone they have befriended that episode (with all of one exception). Yet the organization seems to keep growing through the series, and even the trio were already much-feared criminals before they met Ash and Pikachu. How many trainers must have been less lucky?
</li><li> Ash Ketchum has survived countless Pikachu electrocutions, the combined might of an attack from both Mew and Mewtwo, a chandelier dropping on him, drowning, countless blunt force trauma incidents, Charizard's flame, freezing cold temperatures, etc etc etc... has the point been made yet?
</li><li> Because he is relevant to the Team Flare arc and Lysandre does not support trainers who he deems week, Alain is protected by plot armor. When at risk for losing his Mega Bracelet, he and his Mega Charizard X are able to defeat ten Mega Pokemon in a row, including Elite Four Malva's Mega Houndoom. In record timing also, he is able to gain all eight badges, seven episodes after saying he was not competing in the Kalos League. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He goes onto defeat Ash in the final round of the league, despite his Mega Charizard X taking numerous hits and surviving an Eleventh Hour Superpower from Ash-Greninja.</span>
</li><li> Serena, despite her limited progression as a battler and her lateness to discover a goal, has sparsely failed in <em>anything</em>. Her Pokemon have never fainted once in battle due to either her opponents being Team Rocket or being accompanied by a stronger trainer or dumb luck, while the showcases never conveyed her as losing without a serious folly by one of her team, her act always considered the most popular up until the finals.

She is a girl from the real world who got plopped down in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, and she recognizes it as such. She has no superpowers, but she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>.

This ends up getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in her encounter with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>. While not often too egregious in his own book, the second he steps into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a> book he's a very different character. For someone who is often championed as "Just a normal man" who works very hard, it is very hard to swallow when he will be struck by characters who can rip through steel like paper, be hurled through multiple stone pillars/walls, dodge attacks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> get struck by, and only end up a bit bruised or sore when he should be liquefied by now. Almost always in full force during any Superman vs. Batman encounter where there is seemingly always an excuse why Superman, who even in his weakest incarnation, is "Faster than a speeding bullet" has one iota of trouble against Batman, whose Kryptonite IS bullets. Plus, even when Batman wises up and wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, he often has his helmet in the same shape as his iconic mask, with his mouth completely exposed.

And it makes her, in Director Piggot's words, "scarier than any [parahuman] I've encountered yet. And yes, I am including Nilbog in that total." If anyone is about to harm Taylor, something will happen to stop them. And if they were doing it on purpose, they will be punished in proportion to the scale of their deliberate offense. Taylor's power can sense any attempt to harm her, without any conscious effort on her part, and can if necessary reach back in time up to the moment of her trigger to set events in motion - which makes her get stronger the more time passes. In under two weeks her powers had been able to manipulate reality sufficiently to break the ABB and the Merchants, take out half the Empire-88, terrorize Coil into turning himself in, and lure in and kill/neutralize most of the Slaughterhouse 9, all without any conscious action on Taylor's, and in many cases even her knowledge, suggesting that within a year she'll be utterly unstoppable. On top of it all, her powers work in a variety of bizarre but hilarious Rube Goldberg-esque ways, such as Lung getting tarred and feathered or Kaiser getting hit by a literal ton of frozen crap.
</li><li> <em>KhaosOmega</em> uses this in a rather unusual way; the members of the heroic faction XQ can be hit by attacks that would kill others, but to them it triggers them spontaneously jumping to their strongest available transformation. The events near the end of 'RWBY: Super Rainbow' is considered the point when the result changed; before then the 'failsafe' (as it's often called) jumped the XQ agent to their next available transformation, while afterward the agent jumps to their strongest available natural branch of the infinitely-powerful Super Saiyan Angel form.
<ul><li> The Amethyst Angel herself does it slightly differently; during 'Samurai Angel' she shot straight to the strongest natural branch, Rainbow Nova, and added Ultra Instinct within 24 hours of said first jump.

</li><li> Very unsubtle Plot Armor for human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> was a consistent problem with the live action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a></em> movies. After Sam and Mikaela keep getting thrown into concrete by 20-foot-tall metal creatures and suffering nary a scratch, it becomes impossible for viewers to ever believe they're ever in any real danger, killing suspense. Because of this, when Sam was nearly killed in the second movie (he was caught INSIDE a corny explosion and thrown at least ten feet, all without even significantly damaging his clothing) exactly no one was surprised when he survived without any obvious injury.

</li><li> This becomes rather obvious towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharktopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharktopus">Sharktopus</a></em>, when the killer shark-octopus hybrid has been attacking and killing boatloads of people throughout the film, but is suddenly very reluctant when faced with the hero Andy at the end to actually eat him.

<ul><li> One of the many letdowns of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> books is Meyer's continuous promises of danger to characters followed by little to no follow-through. In the first book, Laurent refuses to fight against James even though it would be an eight to two fight. Which basically means James must be the badass of badasses. Actually Jasper and Emmett take him out alone. And easily. Book Four is the biggest Plot Armor moment when a brutal battle between the Volturi and the Cullen/Cullen allies that has been worked up for ages devolves into a friendly talk and an "okay, let's go home" situation. The <em>Twilight</em> characters are supposed to be in real you-could-really-die situations but somehow everyone leaves unscathed every single time. (With the exception of Jacob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">breaking some bones that heal in a day or two</a>.)

</li><li> Robert Jordan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series has the three main male characters as <em>ta'veren</em>, or "tied to the pattern". Essentially this serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magibabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magibabble">catch-all</a> for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">weird stuff that happens to and around them</a>, very much including their in-universe plot armor.

</li><li> This is made literal in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> novels. In the very first Xanth novel, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bink's magic talent is essentially plot armor, as he cannot be harmed by magic</span>. Unlike many examples, the book is kept interesting because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it is a great deal of the point of the plot, and it is not known that this is his talent until quite late in the book, when he exploits it</span>. In the second book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is specifically chosen for the task of finding the source of magic due to his immunity to harm from it. Despite this, his talent is somewhat picky about what is defined by "harm", and he is still worried that he could be killed by mundane means, as well as by the source of all magic itself, a nearly omnipotent demon. In the end, however, it is implied that his talent is in fact so powerful that even the demon could not overcome it, and that all his seeming misfortune was what saved him in no end</span>. In later books, which become more and more comedy-based, anybody who was one of the stars of a given book has in-universe "major character" status, guaranteeing their safety for at least that one story.
<ul><li> Okra Ogress tries to put Jenny Elf into a life threatening incident, but can't do it simply because Jenny is a major character. Ironically, the reason Okra was trying to get Jenny killed was so that she could get the major character status for herself.

Not even the POV characters are protected <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(at least one, probably two of them are dead by the fifth book)</span>. On the other side, some characters who start as secondary characters and little by little gain importance may (or may not) have a form of plot armor against death:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion</span> are generally perceived by fans to be characters who are going to be there for the end game, even though they are not standard adventure heroes by any stretch of the imagination. Note however that 1) they are not protected against damage, pain and suffering, and 2) when they do something "heroic" for love or idealism, the result is usually quite counterproductive, when not downright disastrous. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> doesn't agree with fans here.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> books were like this at first with all the main characters; particularly notable was when they killed a Chaos Baneblade in <em>Honour Guard</em> while only losing two or three troopers and one tank. However, as the series has progressed, the central characters have been steadily moving away from Plot Armour. Since the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bragg in book 5</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Corbec in book 7</span>, it's been pretty clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>. Indeed, less than 10 characters named in the first book remain alive at the end of the twelfth, with another looking likely to go before the end of number 13.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> is the narrator of his books, which are presented as his memoirs from his time in retirement, so it's kind of a given he'll see the end of each story. Other characters protected by the "memoirs" rationale: Jurgen, Cain's aide-de-camp who stays with Cain his entire documented career; Amberly Vail, Cain's Inquisitorial connection and off-again-on-again lover, who's editing the memoirs; and Jenit Sulla, who we're told very early on will someday become a general (and whose terrible, terrible memoirs often fill in gaps in Cain's narrative), and a handful of one-book characters who cross path with Cain whose survival is proven by Amberley annotating Cain's story with passages from their own recollection of said events (though one of those memoirs includes a note that they were never finished, hinting in advance that he doesn't survive the entire story). Since this is a much more comedic view of the 40K universe, this isn't a problem; even in the grim darkness of the far future, not knowing if a character will survive to the end would damage their humor value. It's also notable in that the characters themselves <em>notice</em>. Cain in particular is so convinced that all of his successes are due to pure luck that he totally overlooks his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> status, and so despite a century of ludicrously one-sided victories thinks of himself as a phony. One group of very religious soldiers he briefly served with ended up so blown away after seeing him take on a powerful daemon that there is now a small sect on their homeworld that considers him a <em>saint</em>.

</li></ul></li><li> As the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series went on, the mortality rate went from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>" to "Only vermin are in danger". Perhaps the nadir: <em>One</em> named, nonvillainous character died in <em>Pearls of Lutra</em>, and she had only had five nonsinging lines beforehand.
</li><li> By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, only one character truly has this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series: MacGuiness, Honor's valet, because Weber's wife likes him. In practice, Honor herself ended up with some, though, as she was supposed to be killed off at the end of <em>At All Costs</em>, only for fan outcry (and a change in the series' timeline) to save her. Also, when in one of the later books a massive catastrophe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wipes out the entirety of a city where one of Honor's relatives is having a birthday party with the whole clan showing up</span>, all but one of the Harringtons we've seen onscreen just barely misses being there, and the one who does bite it was in all of one scene half a series ago.
<ul><li> While there's a definite sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> throughout the series, there is generally plot armor within a single book. If a character goes through significant plot development&mdash;especially if they're newly introduced&mdash;chances are they'll be among the few who survive the inevitable Honor Death Ride toward the end of the book.
</li></ul></li><li> Used as a major plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redshirts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redshirts">Redshirts</a></em>, and the Plot Armor of the <em>Intrepid's</em> head officers is exploited by the main characters in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> travel to the real world and get the television show they're characters on cancelled before their characters are killed off</span>. Later on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Andrew Dahl uses his own Plot Armor to deduce that he is the real main character of the book</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePiratesCoveredInFur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePiratesCoveredInFur">The Pirates Covered in Fur</a></em> shows the main heroes going through grim situations that would (and <em>did</em>) kill off any regular, minor characters. Yet they manage to get through it all with only a couple scratches or bullet wounds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The last third of the story subverts this, and the main characters start dying fast.</span>
</li><li> This trope is one reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix">Gotrek, son of Gurni</a> is either the best or worst member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Slayer Cult</a>, a penitent branch of dwarfen religion, sworn to atone for their sins by finding the biggest baddest enemies of dwarfdom and kill them (repeat until one of said enemies kill them). We don't know how long Gotrek was at this before he hooked up with Felix, but the two of them have been trying to get Gotrek killed for over 25 years in-universe<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4f6hs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4f6hs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4f6hs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> and in that time have literally killed several entire <em>armies</em>, not to mention several god-like beings, a dragon and an entire floating <em>city</em> of Dark Elves</span>. Of course, Gotrek does carry an epic-level magic axe, which makes him significantly harder to kill.
<ul><li> Also applies to many of the other characters, particularly "Mad" Malakai Makaisson (a Slayer engineer, who has survived the explosion of at <em>least</em> two hydrogen-filled airships, plus a mountain exploding and collapsing on him, among other things) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">Grey Seer Thanquol</a> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid">Chaotic Stupid</a> rat-man wizard. He's actually the only major enemy Gotrek and Felix have had that's still alive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Mostly because it's funny</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Seen all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels. Savvy characters sometimes just outright give up/run away because they recognize the plot armor the other guys have.
<ul><li> An obligatory example would be the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></em> - a potential "rival" for Captain Carrot's werewolf girlfriend dies dramatically while Carrot escapes with bad wounds. Vimes can't bring himself to say anything since Carrot's genuinely a good man, but he notes that things tend to work out for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>If you were dice, you'd always roll sixes. And the dice don't roll themselves. If it wasn't against everything he wanted to be true about the world, Vimes might just then have believed in destiny controlling people.

</div><ul><li> At this point, destroying the Disc itself probably couldn't kill Vetinari.
</li><li> A major plot element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero">The Last Hero</a></em>. Cohen and his barbarian heroes have been exploiting it their whole lives, so when they realize they have the numbers on their side against an apparently ordinary man (Carrot again) and that therefore it would be him benefiting from it they instantly stand down.
</li><li> Rincewind the "Wizzard", despite the fact that hes has no magical talent whatsoever, has managed to survive several perils on the disc, often saving it in the process, simply by following a philosophy of always running and acting like a coward. It doesn't hurt that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">the Lady (of luck) loves him; unfortunately, Fate despises him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeltoraQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeltoraQuest">Deltora Quest</a> the main trio of characters come ridiculously close to dying over and over again, but always manage to survive. Barda probably gets the worst of this, getting to "almost dead" at least twice before miraculously surviving.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> plays the trope entirely straight with the six POV characters - since morphing heals injuries, it's easy for them to avoid death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That is, until the final arc, when Rachel gets killed.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Remnants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Remnants">Remnants</a></em>, the author had no qualms at all about killing people, but she did promise before the series began that Jobs and Mo'Steel would survive.

</li><li> <em>Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits</em> averts this. The people watching make fun of an enemy who, falling off a building, continues to fire his gun into the window: but it transpires that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even firing at random, he actually hit and killed Armando</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Harry Potter himself seems to have this, due to being the main character. Each school year, he gets into mortal peril at least once and each time barely manages to survive it due to the circumstances being slightly more in his favor. When people start praising his victories against the dark forces, Harry lampshades this by saying he only succeeded due to having an improbable amount of luck.
</li><li> Arthur Weasley suddenly gained Plot Armor when Rowling was writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>. Her initial plan was for him to actually die after Nagini attacked him, but she realized that killing him would remove the Weasleys as Harry's safe haven and turn Ron from a lighthearted comic relief character to "Half a Harry" i.e., a much darker and serious character, which Rowling did not want. Remus and Nymphadora Lupin die in the final battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em> in Arthur's place.
</li><li> Hagrid has Plot Armor throughout the whole series, because as stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Rowling knew that Hagrid would carry Harry at the end of the 7th book from the very beginning. This Plot Armor allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTamer">safely deal with creatures deemed mortally dangerous by the Ministry for Magic</a>. A minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> with him is that it never really sinks in that they're actually dangerous to normal people; this causes problems when he becomes a teacher.
</li></ul></li><li> Artyom of <em>Metro 2033</em> goes into a lengthy internal monologue about this trope near the end of the book, noting that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikhail Porfirievich, Daniel, and Tretyak all died</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">over the course of his adventure, and yet he managed to survive for no apparent reason</a>.

Tris, who has been the first-person narrator through the entire series, dies in the third book, <em>Allegiant</em>. This is somewhat telegraphed by the fact that she and Four start trading off narration duties at the start of that book when she had been the only narrator before</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em>, the Good Witch of the North's kiss prevents anything in Oz from harming Dorothy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em>, this trope mixed with every other side holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> in a death-grip is practically the only way you could explain the Victorian militias crushing every other army they go up against. Wooden ships with spar torpedoes can apparently easily destroy modern warships, World War II-era short-wave radar is good at catching F-35 stealth fighters, and outdated T-34s are technically better than M1 Abrams for being easier to repair and more reliable (though at least the author tries to justifies this by pointing out that they should avoid pitched battles with modern armour, it doesn't excuse how modern hand-portable anti-tank weapons would shred a T-34 without any trouble).

<ul><li> The true reason the two title characters never stay dead.
</li><li> A particularly blatant example is Spike's special resilience to the sunlight. No-name vampires are seen immediately disintegrating the moment they're pushed into the sunlight, but when Buffy takes off the Gem of Amarra from Spike's finger during their fight in the broad daylight and he remains without protection, he has just enough time to run into the shadow. Other times he can walk during daylight if he just wears a rug over his head (or in season 9 comics, a hat).
</li><li> "Pangs" from season four sees Spike getting hit with multiple arrows to the torso all of which conveniently miss his heart. Lesser vampires have been dusted from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartInTheWrongPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartInTheWrongPlace">similar hits</a> so apparently the only thing that saves Spike is that he's just been promoted to regular character.
</li><li> This also goes for the Scooby characters in earlier seasons such as Willow, Xander, and Cordelia, who have no problem taking nighttime strolls through Sunnydale without Buffy, despite having no special powers or abilities to defend themselves with. With nightly sirings as common as they are portrayed, the group should have been vamped a long time ago.
</li><li> At one point during Season Three, Faith strikes Willow across the mouth in genuine anger. Since Faith is a Slayer (and not inclined to pull punches even when she's in a <em>good</em> mood), only a solid layer of Plot Armor prevents Willow's jaw from shattering.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>:

She however, can be harmed when she isn't acting according to the universe's plans, as this protection is lifted.

<ul><li> The Doctor constantly faces super-powerful alien menaces with only his wit to save him, but he actually survives many of his close scrapes by fortuitous circumstances or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">getting taken captive</a> instead of killed. Of course, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> has allowed him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">regenerate</a> from fatal encounters, but after nearly 800 episodes and over a thousand years worth of often insanely dangerous adventures he's only had to do this 12 times. Specific examples include:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E17E18TheEndOfTime">"The End of Time"</a>, the Doctor jumps from a spaceship, falls approximately half a mile, crashes through a large skylight, lands hard on a marble floor, and sustains only minor injuries.
</li></ul></li><li> The Doctor's companions also have a fairly effective plot armor as well, especially in the original series, as they are usually standard humans facing the same dangers the Doctor does, and keep an extremely low mortality rate with only one or two of them biting the bullet. Companions in the new series have a comparatively weaker plot armor, but even then they tend to leave the Doctor because of some freak space-time accident rather than actual death.
</li><li> The Doctor, when in a really tight spot, will sometimes remind his enemies that not only have they had him in tight spots before, not only does he always win in the end but they often lose big and/or are humiliated in the process. This makes his Plot Armor at least partially self-powered.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka">Eureka</a></em>: Sheriff Jack Carter is responsible for an entire company town of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>, and due to his common-sense way of thinking, always saves the town from self-destructing from their own scientific curiosity. In fact, when an android deputy was commissioned to replace him, things went so spectacularly south during the test drive of the android's abilities that he concludes at the end of his report that with Sheriff Carter around, the town's odds of survival is much better.

<ul><li> The waif stabs Arya almost to the hilt of her knife several times in the stomach. Any one of the resulting wounds would most likely be a mortal injury without modern surgery, but Arya manages to fight off the waif and ultimately survives, by swimming under water far enough for the waif to not find her and walking to a friend's house, who stitches her wounds up. To compare, Robb and Tywin were killed with lesser stabs.
</li><li> Davos Seaworth survives the destruction of his ship, washes up ashore without drowning, and is picked up by Stannis loyalists before he can die of exposure.
</li><li> Ramsay Snow leads Bolton men against Ironborn raiders while bare-chested, despite the importance of armor being lampshaded in the previous episode.
</li><li> Jon Snow survives a major battle after charging the enemy alone and getting caught between two cavalry charges. He has several brushes with death, but fortune (and the Lord of Light) favors him every time.
</li><li> Jaime Lannister charges on horse towards Daenerys who is beside her biggest dragon. Drogon, of course, attacks Jaime with deadly dragonbreath... but he is saved by Bronn tackling him to safety out of nowhere. That safety being a lake where the characters stay under water long enough for the armies to pass. The second time unlimited underwater time saved characters.
</li><li> In "Watchers on the Wall," Gilly sneaks past the wildlings to reach Castle Black, and sitting ducks like Sam and Olly are barely targeted.
</li><li> In the third and most extreme example of unlimited underwater time Jon Snow survives a battle with an army of undead of seemingly a hundred thousand plus by falling in through the ice into freezing water in the middle of the arctic winter and staying underwater while this whole army passes to some distance.
</li><li> In "The Long Night," almost all of the named characters survive seemingly impossible odds, each fighting off scores of wights and suffering only superficial scrapes and scratches. Given that the episode was one of the last of the series, viewers expecting a character bloodbath were very surprised by how many survived. Carried on to the end of the series, the only characters that died who were related to the Long Night were... The Hound, Jaime and Daenerys.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em>: The protagonist IS this trope. The sheer number of times Dr. Lecter has been able to avoid discovery and/or certain death through his opponents' convenient idiocy, ploys that rely on his ability to make people do what he wants without even trying (like a certain neurologist willing to lie to his patient about an inflammation of his brain) or sheer coincidence (caught in the act of murder? thank goodness the witness is face-blind!) would be enough for a series with ten times as many episodes and STILL look ridiculous.

This show deals with espionage, terrorism, and national security, so, combined with the nature of Peter Quinn's character as an elite covert paramilitary operative, this character has exceptionally thick plot armor. Since his introduction in the second season his uniquely strong abilities in espionage, assassination, and surveillance have made him a central player because his presence makes it much easier to advance an interesting, suspenseful plot. Yet for exactly that reason, he has survived numerous attempts to kill him, sometimes bouncing back from near-mortal wounds in record time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As of the second to last episode of Season 6, Quinn has been shot twice in the gut, caught in an explosion, shot in the head (but it only grazed him) and then nearly drowned while trying to escape shooter, and even suffered a stroke after being <em>sarin-gassed</em>. The writers may be somewhat aware of this, as in Season 6, they depict him suffering serious paralysis and cognitive deficits as a result of the stroke. But he is still able to work mostly as well he did previously because he is able to singlehandedly both take down a SWAT team breaking into Carrie's house, and later uncover an internal false flag terrorism conspiracy black-op and kill one of its perpetrators.</span>

But then rest of the Losties (Jack, Kate, Hurley) carry the dynamite without ever exploding, even though they do, in fact, run with it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Happens again in the sixth season, where Ilana, in the middle of a rant, roughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">drops a bag of said dynamite</a>.

Arthur counts as well, but a large amount of that is Merlin shielding him (and in turn being shielded by his Plot Armor).

</li><li> Merlin also managed to go a whole day with a serious sword wound that, that <em>slashed his chest and sliced his stomach</em> while running away from the enemy and having to deal with Arthur's overly attentive panicked mothering. Then he survived a giant rockfall avalanche. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then Morgana healed him and possessed him, making him hellbent on murdering Arthur.</span> Yet somehow, most likely due to Arthur's plot armor, all of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Merlin</span>'s fairly well-thought out attempts on his life flunk for the silliest reasons.
</li><li> Sir Leon has this. The guy survived being bathed in flames by a dragon, being beaten to death long enough to be healed by the Cup of Life, and took a magic bolt to the chest that had just killed two knights and got up without so much as a scratch. Although this isn't Plot Armor so much as Ensemble Darkhorse Armor, and the fact that he's too popular to die.
</li><li> Oddly, Arthur actually had plot armor in the legends. The only reason Mordred succeeded in killing him was that the mythic king wasn't carrying Excalibur - or more importantly, Excalibur's sheath, which made him invulnerable.

<ul><li> The reason the characters never happened to slide right into sulfuric acid.
</li><li> They did once wind up on a world that was completely engulfed in fire - but they were conveniently in the only clear spot we saw, just big enough for them, and were only stuck there for 10 seconds. (Mind you, simply not touching the flames would be no protection whatsoever from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection">the heat of being surrounded by that much flame</a>. However, since the fire on that world was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> alive, and a little of it followed them, perhaps it <em>decided</em> not to harm them.</span>
</li><li> One slide had them facing down some whacked-out tsunami coming to turn California into very tiny dirt clumps. Fortunately it was a short trip.
</li><li> While their plot armor managed to save them from several of the most horrible scenarios, it had no qualms with leaving them at the status quo as well... in one episode, they slid into a world in which everyone - including them - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">had become filthy stinking rich</a>. Naturally, they could only stay for a few minutes and didn't have time to capitalize on their newfound wealth.

Par for the course for this series, it's the Russian ship which goes down (despite 2 main characters being aboard).
</li><li> A variation of this trope appears in the fourth season episode "2010", in which the four regulars do actually die, but they are considerably more resistant to the effects of the automatic security weapons than an unnamed extra who dies almost instantly.

</li><li> This happens multiple times. Alternate versions, cloned versions, or "our" versions in the presence of something that can save them lose their plot armor fast. Daniel Jackson is particular is noted for dying or otherwise taking critical damage over and over and <em>over</em> again.

During space battles the ships that house major characters also have character shields, with many other ships being destroyed instead.
<ul><li> A common thing for the Chief Medical Officer of all the series to do whenever someone is injured or killed has a near suicidal tendency to walk right up to said person right that second and start administering treatment, even if whatever threat that hurt that person is still there, such as in the middle of a firefight. This trope seems to be the only adequate explanation these people don't end up dead.
</li><li> The lethality of phaser weapons also seem to vary wildly depending on who they're being shot at. While there are multiple phaser settings that usually include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay">disintegrate</a></em>, against main characters they only seem to have three: stun, knock back, and mildly scorch.

This is mostly necessary to preserve her pairing with Jack as the lead characters on the show, since Jack is explicitly immortal and can thus be expected to survive pretty much anything that gets thrown at him.

While these characters are certainly placed in danger often enough, they are often kept alive by what amounts to pure luck. Possibly the most transparent example of this is at the beginning of Season 5, where Rick, Daryl, and Glenn are about to be slaughtered by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalClan">Cannibal Clan</a> and are placed at the end of a line with nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a> in front of them.

Fourth Edition also introduced the reverse: '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">minions</a>' are adversaries that specifically exist to be taken out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder">the first hit</a> to be scored against them and thus explicitly lack any plot armor whatsoever. A high-level character's hit points don't necessarily mean he or she can withstand more damage, it just means that they've become adept at making attacks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a>. An arrow that causes 20 damage would fatally lodge in the throat of a 1st level fighter or minion, but only superficially graze a 20th level fighter. This is all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> for explaining why some human-sized adventurers can survive more damage than monsters the size of houses.
</li><li> A great many games have points you can spend on various things including not taking damage. Plot Points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Serenity</a></em>, Chips in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> etc. etc. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWorldOfDarkness">The World of Darkness</a></em> games generally don't have this but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KindredOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KindredOfTheEast">Kindred of the East</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfVampire">Dhampyr</a> actually do have Plot Armor in the form of Passive Joss, which is a form of involuntary luck that sometimes stops them being hit by throwing freak events in the way.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheLordOfTheRingsStrategyBattleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheLordOfTheRingsStrategyBattleGame">The Lord Of The Rings Strategy Battle Game</a></em> gave major characters something like "Fate points" &mdash; allowing them to shrug off wounds just <em>because</em> they're major characters. The number of fate points a character gets is determined by how good their final fate in the films and books is &mdash; for instance, Aragorn, Sam, Gandalf the White etc. have high fate point counts, whereas Boromir, Denethor, Gr&iacute;&shy;ma Wormtongue etc have low counts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> there's an option to play a "cinematic campaign", which basically allows the DM to run the show based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. Characters start out with <em>twice</em> the normal point allowance (and they're considerably more badass than ordinary people to begin with), they get special bonuses in combat, and they can save an unspent character point or two to shake off a bad injury as "just a flesh wound."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>
<ul><li> The game has a "karma pool" for each character. You can "burn" one or more dice to give yourself a bonus to some challenging roll at a moment of dire need. The karma is gone once used, but survive long enough and you'll get more.
</li><li> <em>Shadowrun</em> also has a related rule called Dead Man's Trigger. The character will still die, but by using up their entire Karma pool, they can enact one last action before expiring. This can result in the last hero standing shooting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> dead just before succumbing to all the wounds taken during the final climactic battle, making it literal plot armor... it protects the plot, even if it doesn't manage to protect the character.
</li></ul></li><li> Invulnerable saves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> and Ward saves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> are usually justified as superior agility, supernatural toughness, magical wards, or force fields, but for some people they are explained as luck or fate.
<ul><li> Plenty of special characters have the Eternal Warrior rule that grants them immunity to instant death attacks. It's supposedly to represent their superhuman toughness, but let's face it, the game developers don't want to see the likes of Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines or Abaddon the Despoiler, Warmaster of Chaos get one-shotted by a lascannon on the first turn (bonus points for being from Games Workshop's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> faction). It might be worth noting that Abaddon has gotten killed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf">White Dwarf</a></em> Battle Reports (in one case he was cut to ribbons by the Sanguinor). Abaddon actually has this as an ability in the 30k ruleset <em>The Horus Heresy</em>. Increasing his odds of surviving enemy attacks to show that the Chaos Gods have plans for him.
</li><li> The playable factions get this to a degree but the worst offenders are The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NominalHero">Imperium</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">Man</a>; especially a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">all-male</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Power-armour wearing</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">faction</a>. For example, during the campaign for Cadia, Abaddon won but they retconned the campaign as not canon, because then Chaos would win and the Imperium, apparently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> of 40K, would fall.
</li><li> The RPG spinoffs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em> and associated games have it as a rule. Characters have a small number of Fate points that are good for rerolls and other bonuses each session, but they can be permanently lost to allow for a character that would otherwise die to miraculously survive the encounter.
</li></ul></li><li> The newer <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20">Star Wars d20</a></em> has "Force points" which can be spent on temporary bonuses.
<ul><li> The older Revised Edition d20 <em>Star Wars RPG</em> had vitality points to represent hits as tiring near-misses, and critical hits could very well kill you since they bypassed them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> has "Moxie," which can be used to "flip" a roll - since all rolls in <em>Eclipse Phase</em> are done on percent die (d100) flipping a roll can turn a 91 (a very bad failure, usually) into an 19 (a nearly guaranteed success). Criticals (11, 22, etc.) are notable for not being flippable - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">Critical Failure</a> (99) is irredeemable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HongKongActionTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HongKongActionTheatre">Hong Kong Action Theatre</a></em> bases its difficulties to hit characters directly on their importance to the plot of the "movie." Player characters are assumed to be of major importance, and are generally much tougher and more skilled than minor importance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>, who go down like tenpins when faced with the former and often need a natural 20 to even hit them at all. The top tier of importance is Extreme which is mainly reserved for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Major and Extreme importance characters can make Toughness rolls to resist getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Killed</a> if their opponent scores a natural 20, dodge grenade explosions that would kill lesser characters, and even survive getting blown up provided that they can take the damage.
</li><li> Similar to (and preceding) Fourth Edition D&amp;D, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> has a "minion" rule that designates certain enemies as lacking plot armor - one good hit floors them. The "default to nonlethal" rule also acts as a form of plot armor; however, on the same page is the rules for lethal damage, for when the gloves come off.
</li><li> West End Games' old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD6">Star Wars d6</a></em> RPG had this trope codified in the rules. No matter what else happened, you would rarely die. They called it "Script Immunity" and a number of people still identify this trope by that name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeavyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeavyGear">Heavy Gear</a></em> uses a system that rates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> by chess pieces, to help GMs to maintain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaplot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaplot">continuity</a> of the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">fiction</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> features characters who simply are invulnerable because the GM declares that they are. This protection is absolutely inviolable and only bestowed by the GM's grace. The GM is encouraged to make you rue the day you were cloned should you attack such characters. Knowing that this is the case is treasonous, and whining about it is doubly so. Now, taking advantage of it without admitting you know about it is decidedly in the spirit of the game. Nothing can save you if the GM gives it to <em>you</em>; you're being set up for a legendary fall.
</li><li> Several games that rely on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaplot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaplot">Metaplot</a> make sure that their important characters, when they show up in a published adventure, are impossible for the PCs to kill. Sometimes they simply don't have stats at all to avert the tabletop version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">Lord British Postulate</a> ("if you stat it, they will kill it"), while other times, the GM is simply instructed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">railroad</a> the plot so that they survive whatever the PCs do.
<ul><li> Examples of the former include Antediluvians and Caine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, Harlequin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em>, and Stone from the first edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em>. In later editions, Stone gets stats, but he gets a special ability that leaves him effectively invulnerable anyway. Likewise, Harlequin was given stats in the recent <em>Street Legends</em> sourcebook, although the sheer amount of defensive abilities he has makes him effectively invincible anyway.
</li><li> One of the most infamous examples of the latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Samuel Haight</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em>; Storytellers are explicitly told to ensure that he gets away with whatever he does. Ultimately, however, even White Wolf got sick of him, and he ended up dead and turned into an ashtray in the Shadowlands.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of the latter may be the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a> D&amp;D modules NPCs were all fully statted, but the GM was instructed to arrange a last-minute escape and/or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">Never Found the Body</a> situation whenever necessary to preserve someone for future plot. The writers called it "obscure death."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> has something like this in the form of consequences and concessions.
<ul><li> Consequences are a series of wounds that a character can take to avoid being Taken Out and keep fighting. While PCs and named NPCs generally are allowed the choice to use them or not, GMs are advised not to give any consequences to mooks. As a result, a successful gunshot that will kill a Mook might cause a PC to weather it with only a twisted ankle from ducking out of the way.
</li><li> Concessions are a way to be Taken Out on your own terms. In normal gameplay, whoever strikes the final blow that takes someone out decides what happens&mdash;whether the target lives or dies, for a start. But taking a concession means you decide how you're Taken Out, at the cost of some still-tangible loss. So while a vampire taking out a PC may well result in the vampire killing that PC to retrieve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, a PC conceding to a vampire may mean the PC is merely knocked out while the vampire grabs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> and makes good an escape. This process is, again, typically not offered to nameless mooks.
</li><li> The Fate System in general (which is what <em>Dresden Files</em> uses) assigns plot armor in a pretty straightforward fashion. Major plot-relevant characters (including all player characters, of course) get standard-length stress tracks and a full set of consequence slots, while the less important the character is, the less stress and the fewer consequences they can take before being Taken Out &mdash; to the extreme of the lowest-ranking "nameless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> " in some versions such as <em>Fate Core</em> not getting even a single stress box to their name and simply being taken out of any conflict right on the first successful hit. These guys make, for example, excellent anonymous innocent bystanders for villains and monsters to threaten.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">/tg/</a>-created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GiantGuardianGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GiantGuardianGeneration">Giant Guardian Generation</a></em>, Plot Armor is the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAHitPointASmeerp">PCs' hit points</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> that aren't the players' rivals or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Bosses</a> don't have it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft">Spycraft</a></em>, a critical hit will kill any "minion"-class enemy in one shot, but will only knock an enemy Agent or major villain unconscious.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> setting features a rare case where this trope is invoked in-universe. The Time of Cascading Years is what happened when due to a botched spell, time itself got broken and the various people started living in separate timelines. Some powerful Exalted and their retainers finally managed to fix the situation... but <em>only for themselves</em>. In other words, the only person who got through the Cascading Years are people who remember actively taking part to the effort to repair time (one way or another). The bystanders just ceased to exist.
</li><li> Everyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> has a <em>bit</em> of plot armour in the form of Story Points. The real question is <em>how much</em>? If the character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a>, they might have a quarter of the points a hero or major character has. Player characters have the added advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">manipulating the plot</a>, meaning they can get out of situations no NPC would have a chance of escaping.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CthulhuTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CthulhuTech">CthulhuTech</a></em> has an in-universe spell to provide this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading">Rail Roading</a> purposes: Yog-Sothoth's Guard. It grants temporary invulnerability and immunity to restraint, and while it's not <em>impossible</em> for the player characters to get it, it's very expensive for them to use. Villains with Yog-Sothoth's Guard are more or less designed to frustrate PC attempts to deal with them before the module writer is good and ready.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> has a spell that gives everyone nearby Plot Armor. Laff Riot, learned by Videomancers, replaces the normal rules of the world - here defined as a gritty, modern horror game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> and where fighting someone can break you psychologically as well as cripple you physically - with that of a family-friendly soap opera. All injuries become amusing booboos, everyone survives horrible situations through amusing pratfalls, and even deliberate attempts to murder someone go completely off the rails. As soon as the spell wears off, it's back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapSackWorld">Crapsack World</a>.
</li><li> '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>'' 2nd Edition grants every player character Hero Points that can be sacrificed to stave off death when mortally wounded, granting all players limited plot armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Continuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Continuum">Continuum</a></em> has a strange form of plot armor. As a game about time travel, it has everything you are obligated to do enter your Yet - the things you must do. So it is entirely possible your death enters your Yet. That means your death is known, which means you have plot armor from other deaths, and in a game about time travel, that means even knowing you die tomorrow doesn't mean you don't have a lot of time yet.
<ul><li> It gets weirder when you realize you might be wrong about your death, and it could be a clone, copy, or other shenanigans. This might become important should you die some other way, as the other time-traveling player characters now are separated from the real timeline by knowing a false one. They probably will be very interested in staging your "predicted" death in order to avoid this condition. Continuum is <em>weird.</em>
</li><li> Continuum's plot armor protects the plot. It averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlersTimeTravelExemptionAct">Hitler's Time Travel Exemption Act</a> - a time traveler killed him. However, the secret society of time travelers of the Continuum has to keep history intact, so they've had to patch the timelines so what the history books said happened is...close to accurate. This means clones, body doubles, stealing the real Hitler for a bit, etc. Naturally, the replacement Hitlers keep getting killed or abducted or saved or whatever, too. The Continuum - which includes the Player Characters, literally are the plot armor keeping history as we know it intact. Too many paradoxes actually tear reality apart, or tear people out of reality. Continuum is a weird game.
<ul><li> Joanne of Arc, for example, knows she dies in medieval France eventually. She is currently an agent of the Continuum. Do <em>not</em> mess with her. She will win, because she is going to die in medieval France when she decides it's time to fulfill her destiny.

Since you will get all your scenes, even if you die, you will get to keep playing. You can create flashbacks which lay out incredibly, amazingly brutal ad hoc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a> for the schadenfreude of it, and if you're not all about that schadenfreude, you would not be playing Fiasco. Additionally, many scenarios have endless ways to bring the dead back if there are supernatural forces or mad science at work. Finally, you could always just look at the relationships and role of your late character and play out NPCS doing terrible, no-good things that develop out of the death of your character. Dying can be surprisingly liberating.

It is impossible for any character to die unless they have completed their destiny, unless their destiny actually <em>involves</em> dying.

Seemingly normal enemies to kill will sometimes soak up any and all weapons you throw at them, even though they are shown spewing fuel, oil, smoke, and debris. They just won't die, until you reach a certain point, whether it's a boss fight finishing his monologue, or a certain mook flying to a specific location to have a cinematic death. Even if you are the best player ever, and hit with every shot, avoid every attack, and never lose sight of your target, some of them refuse to die until it's time.
</li><li> Unlike regular Mech Warriors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, the player's character, or commander in the game, cannot be killed in combat. Even if they were to take lethal damage from cockpit destruction or max injuries, they are guaranteed to survive (even if the lethal game setting option is turned on that ensures an incapacitated pilot will die).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrothersInArms">Brothers in Arms</a></em>, any squad members who die in missions will magically come back to life at the end of the level.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> not only plays with the trope, but directly calls you out on it. Several characters know that while the playable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> <em>can</em> die, the kid's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">determination</a> allows them to go back in time and reset the timeline over and over until they overcome the obstacle they face, which is similar to how a player keeps reloading their save file whenever they lose so that they can keep trying until they win. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The main antagonist also has the ability to load and save during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight, allowing them to screw you over indefinitely until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">a third party steps in to prevent the antagonist from reloading their save file.</a></span>

Link's Plot Armor actually <em>wears off</em> during the final battle against Ganondorf. Though there's no cutscene for it in-game, according to the timeline later put together in <em>Hyrule Historia</em>, if you lose that fight the next game in the series becomes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">A Link to the Past</a></em>, rather than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Wind Waker</a></em> (the future of the timeline where Ganondorf took over Hyrule but then was defeated) or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em> (a timeline where the child Link used his knowledge of the future to help avert Ganondorf's invasion before it happened).

This becomes subverted in <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em>, in which the main characters have to breach the barrier that divides the real world from the netherworld in order to take Gensokyo's spring back. Yuyuko states this before fighting Reimu saying that being at that point of the netherworld basically means she's probably dead. Even if Reimu loses against the non-lethal spellcard rules, all the spring in Gensokyo will resurrect the Saigyou Ayakashi and Fridge Horror will remind you of his abilities.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> sees all members of Noble Team sans the sniper Jun die during the game (Jorge and Carter both perform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifices">Heroic Sacrifices</a>, Kat gets sniped from above and behind, Emile gets stabbed but manages to live just long enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">kill the Elite who stabbed him</a>, and the player character gets swarmed by Covenant but is stubborn enough that it takes seven Elites (most of whom do not survive the cutscene) to finish him/her off).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland2LeChucksRevenge">Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge</a></em> , the game starts with Guybrush talking to Elaine whilst hanging over a pit. The game is him recounting his latest adventure, and at one point you can actually kill Guybrush- only for Elaine to point out that Guybrush can't have died because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">he's there talking to her now</a>.
</li><li> Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DanganRonpa">Danganronpa</a></em> uses this and subverts to clarify that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The first victim of the first game is played as if she has this, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> and played as if she was going to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonist</a>, something she was during the demo, her death is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> that clarifies the nature of the game.</span> In the second game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first victim is a survivor from the previous game</span>. And in the third, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first one executed is the <em>player character</em>. The role is taken up by another character from this point on</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> averts it with NPCs. You can kill anyone in the game if you so choose and are strong enough to do so. For most plot-important characters, killing them will result in a pop-up text stating that the character you've killed was vital to "fulfilling the prophecy" and recommending that you load a saved game from before their death or "persist in the doomed world you created", but that is all. (And some plot-important NPCs do not give this message.)
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> play this trope straight, as a large amount of characters related to quests are marked as "essential", meaning they literally can't die before their role in the game is fulfilled. If their health does reach zero, they fall unconscious in <em>Oblivion's</em> case, while merely kneeling in <em>Skyrim</em>, only to stand up moments later as if nothing happened. This is done to prevent players from breaking entire questlines by killing certain characters, which was a huge problem in <em>Morrowind</em>. However, this can still end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> if essential characters become trapped somewhere where they continuously take damage, like a lava pit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> is similar to <em>Skyrim</em> in this regard: an NPC flagged "essential" will take a knee when it reaches zero hitpoints instead of dying. Any NPC involved in a current quest, available as a companion, or involved in the main plot tends to have this flag, meaning almost every named NPC in the game that's not specifically an enemy is immortal and invincible. This causes the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Diamond City Blues</span> quest to be significantly more shocking than intended, since a named allied NPC that runs a store (storekeepers are also mostly flagged) can die during a combat sequence with no buildup or fanfare.
<ul><li> Mostly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, where every adult NPC can be killed, though certain plot-important NPCs only appear in certain. Played straight with Yes Man and Victor, with the justification that as AI, they can simply jump between different Securitron units.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a> is normally a feature. However, certain characters are critical enough to the plot that they'll merely suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a> when reduced to 0 HP, rather than be killed, at least until the end of the war where it's sometimes stated they died of their wounds instead of getting their (usually) happy ending. Gameplay-wise, the effect is the same, but it allows them to still appear in cutscenes where needed. The actual main characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">give a Game Over if they die.</a>
</li><li> Deirdre and Julia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> have a unique case of this. If either of them reaches 0 HP, they'll be captured by the enemy, and rescued at the end of the chapter. This is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <em>needs</em> them alive, since they carry the bloodline of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> he's trying to revive</span>.
</li><li> Eyvel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> is similarly plot-critical, but has a variant: for the first part of the game, she automatically dodges any attacks that'd kill her. This is to ensure that she makes it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the chapter where she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turned to stone</a> by the main villain</span>. As Eyvel is an overleveled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> with an absurdly high dodge rate, and <em>Thracia</em> characters can never have more than 99% hit rates anyway, it's remarkably easy for players to assume Eyvel is just somewhat lucky.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>:
<ul><li> If a plot-critical NPC is "killed" during gameplay, outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Plotline Death</a>, they will later come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> and call you to pick them up from the hospital.
</li><li> Also, in a rare aversion of this trope, all your characters "deaths" (referred to as being "wasted" in-game, as you are merely considered wounded and start the next scene at a hospital, <em>even if you had your head chopped off</em>) and arrests are canon for the rest of the game (unless you reset to the last save point obviously) and are counted up on your stats screen. It should be noted though that it doesn't effect the gameplay at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> has plot armor return for the player characters and their friends/family. Killing an NPC related to the player character or even killing another player character will just have them respawn later on and you footing the bill for their hospital fees. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The plot armor is removed for Trevor and Michael, two of the three playable characters, if you choose to go for the endings where one of them has to die and thus they will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III</em> hero units took less damage from most forms of attack. Even though they could be slain non-plot, they could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">revived at special Altars</a>. Certain plot-important enemies during the campaign had "Divine" armor that could only be damaged by units doing Chaos-type damage, which are almost impossible to obtain. Therefore, characters with Divine Armor aren't meant to be slain in conventional combat and can only be defeated by completing the mission as the developers intended.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>, the main characters are always protected against the various zombifying viruses and outbreaks, at least partially due to gameplay mechanics. The developers attempted to handwave the whole thing by saying that 10% of the world's population has a natural immunity to the virus, which would explain why the protagonists never get infected.
<ul><li> The T-Virus that the heroes try to fight against is spread via biting (or through the environment, like water), and you can have your player bitten (or wade through T-Virus infested water in the case of the first game) and suffer no ill side effects.
</li><li> Taken to the extreme in Leon's fight against the first Lepotitsa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em>; the creature releases the C-Virus in gas form that instantly zombifies anyone who breathes it in... but Leon and Helena only lose some health from it.
</li><li> The only exception is the first game's Yawn, who poisons the player normally instead.
</li><li> Also, Jill gets infected in the third game, but another survivor, Carlos, is able to make a vaccine for her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a> II</em> (and associated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">add-ons</a>), the home bases for the character are able to take damage far exceeding the defensive stats in the manual. In the WC2 add-ons, the <em>Bonnie Heather</em> is pretty much unkillable by anything. Attempting to destroy it using the "Finger of God" option in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode">Debug Mode</a> crashes the game.
</li><li> It's pretty much a given in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis">Time Crisis</a></em> series that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wild Dog</span> will be in every game, even if he suffers grave wounds every time.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wild Dog</span> takes it a bit beyond "grave wounds." He blows himself up in <em>every</em> game, yet inexplicably returns in the next.
</li></ul></li><li> Unusually, the player is put at the recieving end of this trope at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em>. As the game is a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> and follows the story of Zack Fair, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">tragically</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a>, you're put against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a> and left to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>. However, whether offscreen or by your own hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Zack actually beats the army!</a> That's right, you can kill every single soldier sent to kill you! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Eeevery single one of them...</a> <em>Except,</em> of course, for those three guys who are required by the plot to survive the fight and kill you; those three guys are literally immortal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> has particularly bad examples of this where the main characters lie prostrate at the feet of the villains only to not be killed. And this happens no less than three times.
<ul><li> At least one of these is justified. Especially at the end of Disk I, because the person looking at the party is none other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> Kuja.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded by Balthier, the self-proclaimed "Leading Man" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. While performing a heroic sacrifice during the game's climax, he assures his companion Fran that the main character "never dies". She seems to doubt his Plot Armor however, as she admits that he's "more of a supporting role". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He lives!</span>
</li><li> Over the course of the story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a>, including the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, often find themselves in perilous situations or sustaining grave injuries, only to be stated afterwards to have survived and been placed on the mend, such that they may return later.

To name a few examples from <em>Heavensward</em> and <em>Stormblood</em>, where these instances are more common:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vidofnir, a dragon seeking peace with Ishgard, is run through by Nidhogg controlling Estinien's body. Her injuries are non-fatal and she recovers after Nidhogg is vanquished.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> A frequent fan criticism in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, where important characters and factions are usually kept around despite the constant warfare and ubiquitous overwhelming odds which should have by rights wiped them out years ago. Particularly frustrating when you see a main character do something despicable (this is war, after all) and just know they're never going to be meaningfully punished.
<ul><li> Notably, the majority of politically important player groups probably should no longer exist. The Blood Elves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and Goblins are all the "last survivors" of various devastating wars and disasters, but can all still muster sufficient troops at any given time. The Darkspear are supposedly a small tribe with at most a few thousand members, but their numbers and military prowess never seems to dwindle.
</li><li> Non-player groups benefit from this as well. The Scarlet Crusade couldn't have been a very big movement to begin with, but despite years of being kicked around by neverending Scourge, Alliance, and Horde attacks, they remain active and prominent simply because the Forsaken need enemies to fight who are objectively more evil than they are. There logically couldn't be more than a few hundred High Elves or survivors of Lorderon around, but those groups can always muster sufficient military forces when the story calls for them. (This is particularly ironic in the case of Lorderon, given that their forces are almost always further devastated by whatever they're called on to fight.)
</li><li> A particularly pronounced example was the Siege of Orgrimmar. At face value this would be a devastating setback for the Horde and a decisive, even potentially conflict-ending win for the Alliance. But of course, the game must maintain its balance of relative power, so you quickly realize that very little real damage can or will be done to the Horde. In fact, the necessity of letting Horde players themselves paradoxically lay siege to their own capital resulted in a storyline that gave more immediate political and military benefits of the battle <em>to the Horde</em> themselves.
</li><li> The comic "Anduin: Son of the Wolf" ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> to a conversation between Velen and Anduin, the latter of whom is now an old man. Given that Anduin is only 17 in <em>Legion</em>, this means both of these characters must survive for at least the next 50 or so in-universe years &mdash; probably well beyond the lifespan of WoW, unless there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> or something. It's especially bad because the comic came out right around the time Velen announced his seemingly suicidal plan to retake Argus from the Burning Legion.
</li></ul></li><li> Plot-critical friendly ships in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> games are typically indestructible: they'll go down to 93% hull and then stop. The jumpgates are also indestructible unless otherwise specified by the plot (as in the Kha'ak invasion of President's End in <em>X2: The Threat</em>).
</li><li> Levant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeCocoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeCocoon">Jade Cocoon</a></em> has literal, in-universe plot armor in the form of a ring he wears. When he loses all his health the ring warps him back to the entrance with 1HP, essentially making it impossible for him to die. If you lose to a boss and challenge them again, they <em>even mock you for having to use it, and taunt that you'll never be able to beat them</em>.
</li><li> In any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> videogames where the player is fighting in the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader's T.I.E Fighter is indestructible, no matter how many times you hit it. Hitting Vader's T.I.E fighter enough times will result in you being able to evade it, via Vader's fighter spinning out of control. This was the case in both the original 1983 arcade game and the 1998 <em>Star Wars Trilogy</em> arcade game.
</li><li> Many hostile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">aces</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starlancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starlancer">Starlancer</a></em> try to jump away once damaged enough. Some of these can be killed as an optional objective, provided can kill them in the few seconds it takes to power up their drives. This can usually only be accomplished by immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">spamming dumbfire rockets</a> when they power up. Other aces are part of the plot in later missions and become flat out invulnerable during those few seconds. You won't know which case applies until after you've wasted half your missile loadout.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DestroyAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DestroyAllHumans">Destroy All Humans!</a></em> subverts Plot Armor as death results in a new clone of Crypto the alien being created. Yet, it does not explain the lack of effect the original dead alien has on authorities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> has a mission called "Shoot this guy in the face", where you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">shoot the guy in the face</a>. This trope kicks in if you attempt to shoot him anywhere else; attack him anywhere but his face (or hit him in the face with a melee attack) and it won't do anything to him.
</li><li> The Warrior of Light/the player character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has plot armor to an absurd degree. They're immune to being brainwashed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">primals</a>, they shake off an attack from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Midgardsormr, an ancient dragon that has the capability to level entire cities</span>, and can basically survive any attack thrown their way while anyone else that is not the main characters are cannon fodder. This is handwaved by explaining that the Warrior of Light is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsGood">protected with Hydaelyn's blessing</a>, which allows them to survive a lot of things. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Despite the fact that the blessing is removed when the Heavensward secnario begins, the Warrior of Light still has plot armor.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingsOfGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingsOfGlory">Wings of Glory</a></em>, the named members of your squadron who participate in the main plot cannot be shot down in missions.
</li><li> Sigmund from the Cave Goblin questline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> repeatedly avoids death by using the in-game Ring of Life that teleports the person wearing it to safety if they reach 10% HP or less. He is, however, immune to killing blows and will always have at least one point left when it activates, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even when his hand is cut off before it can teleport him to safety. With no method to escape this time, he loses his plot armour and finally dies.</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GodOfWarPS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GodOfWarPS4">God of War (PS4)</a></em>, the sons of Thor Magni and Modi believe they have this because the prophecies surrounding Ragnarok claim they will survive it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Kratos kills Magni anyway at the end of their boss battle, Modi is horrified and can scarcely believe it.

At times, you may end up having to fight these characters as part of a mission, before they would stop contributing to the plot, in which case, they will retreat instead of dying. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Melinda Megamelons</a> however, is exempt from this, and can die at any point past the prologue, in which case, she will be replaced by a nameless substitute.

It happens again in the fifth trial, where he's getting executed and by all means shouldn't survive, but Alter Ego managed to use the last of his strength to save him (keep in mind, if it's Kyoko getting executed instead, Alter Ego doesn't show up to help).</span> It even extends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the ONLY person who's brainwashing video gets interrupted.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a> Junko even shows that his luck always saves him whenever he needs it by deliberately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> throwing a wrench at his head.

Interestingly, the heroicness or justness of the deaths are decided by a clock, it is not clear if a single clock or one per character, but the important thing is that the clock simply exists within the universe of the story, meaning characters could conceivably go and mess with it to kill or save a particular God Tier.

Any character from a canon series are still under the protection of the source material's plot armor, so any injuries they suffer won't kill them until their time of death in canon; hence why the agents can send them to Medical and get them patched up. While agents themselves can and have died in the line of duty, the sheer number of times they've subdued Mary Sues more powerful than canon characters and certainly themselves makes it clear they've got a lot of this going on as well.

That being said, there are some Manhunts in which Dream loses, but they happen really late in the video.

Despite her manipulative tactics earning the ire of just about every other player, she repeatedly manages to avoid elimination either by earning literal invincibility or through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a> to make another player's elimination seem more immediately necessary. The most egregious examples would be Geoff's and Leshawna's elimination. For the former, despite having wanted Heather gone for weeks and finally having the perfect opportunity to boot her (no invincibility, no immediate issues with other players), they decide to vote off Geoff instead for "being too nice," justifying this sudden shift in attitude with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>. In the latter, the eliminated contestants all have a chance to vote off one of the remaining team players, making it the perfect chance to say a certain someone's name. Unfortunately, so much as saying a contestants name counts as a vote, so when Katie and Sadie mistakenly vote for Leshawna, with many of the other contestants saying they <em>don't</em> want her voted off while using her name, she gets the boot anyway.

<ul><li> Fry's death has been subverted kind of often. In one of the first episodes it was implied that he was mere days from death.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
</div><ul><li> Every one of the several times Fry has "died," or done something that was supposed to result in his death, it turned out he either wasn't really dead, it didn't happen, etc. Though, he did die just like nearly everyone else as part of the premise of the "Rebirth" episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a></em> wasn't immune to this as well, with various criminals clearly having an easy target at Batman or another hero. Of course, they always miss their target. The rare example being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, who was able to casually vaporize a fairly important character with disregard. People didn't even realize he was actually dead until the funeral scene kicked in.
<ul><li> Of course, Darkseid does have 'chase you down' death-beam eyeballs.
</li><li> Naturally, Batman and Superman both have Plot Armor to avoid or just plain tank it anyway. It's even more silly in the actual comic storyline, where they LITERALLY are protected by The Source, one of the aspects of The Presence/DC God, and therefore are practically immune to his Omega Beams.
</li></ul></li><li> Of course, in <em>any</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">Family-Friendly Firearms</a> show, the effectiveness of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapon">Energy Weapons</a> is inversely proportional to the importance/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>-ness of the character struck. Bonus points if near misses cause scenery to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">explode massively.</a>

</li><li> The same goes for Wile E. Coyote, who by all rights should be dead mere minutes into his episodes. Every scheme he attempts to catch his prey either results in him blowing up, falling off a cliff, or generally getting badly hurt, yet he's fine and hunting all over again immediately after.

<ul><li> More generally, that the team was able to operate at all when the Light had the resources and power to wipe them out in two seconds flat at basically any point. Ditto with the Justice League actually, though they were kept alive because the Light wanted to frame them. For some reason.

Although he may take an occasional beating, death can't touch him. Not only does he always survive certain doom, he's almost always saved by the most amazing and unlikely of circumstances, usually at the last possible second. His own people tried to rid themselves of him by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> deliberately crashing his space ship into the desert outside Roswell, New Mexico</span> but no dice.
<ul><li> Stan also undergoes all sorts of horrific injuries and scenarios, including, on separate occasions, being paralysed by gun shot (and rehabilitated by another), having his retinas detached, undergoing numerous bloody beatdowns, losing his legs to a polar bear attack and briefly being pronounced dead on at least two occasions. Regardless of this however, he always recovers and reverts to the Status Quo by the end of each episode.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>, Zordrak is implied to have killed his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMooks">Slave Mooks</a> the Urpneys in hundreds for the slightest failure. However <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Urpgor, Sgt Blob and his cadets</a> not only are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> and constantly survived near certain fatal scenarios and injuries but were never properly disposed of by Zordrak despite their constant bumbling (though at least one episode justifies this, with Zordrak having decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">killing mooks on a whim isn't very productive</a>).
<ul><li> Their foes, Rufus and Amberley, are even more exaggeratively safeguarded, generally defeating their foes with barely any effort and usually being totally immune to even slapstick pain. Even cases the Urpneys offer a genuine threat and have them on the ropes, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> will quickly dumb it back down so the Noops still have victory just a couple easy steps within their grasp. Only a handful of episodes force the Noops to deal with a challenge based on their own competence, and even then it's difficult to say they don't have the story on their side.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>, there have been deaths, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Winx Club and the Specialists</a> are wearing plot armor and are off limits to that.
