When adding examples, please keep in mind that Alice simply having covered Bob's song isn't this trope. Examples should be added to the main list sorted by song name, but for ease of reference, there are also two lists sorted by musician name. If Alice has covered a lot of songs, add examples of this to the "by covering musician" list. If Bob has been covered a lot<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u1qt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1u1qt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u1qt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">he has</a></span>, add examples to the "by covered musician" list.

<ul><li> The Specials didn't write "A Message to You Rudy" or "Monkey Man". That was Dandy Livingstone and Toots &amp; the Maytals, respectively.
</li><li> Some people think that "Pressure Drop" is a Specials original. Slightly better informed people think that they were covering The Clash. In fact, the original is by Toots and the Maytals (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em> players may be more familiar with the original).
</li><li> The Sweet's "AC/DC," by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett">Joan Jett</a>. At the very least, it sounds less brazenly offensive coming from her. The Sweet version seems to be on the radio a lot more, at least on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a>'s radio show.
</li><li> Billy Ray Cyrus' debut single "Achy Breaky Heart" was first recorded by an obscure act called the Marcy Brothers. Their version was called "Don't Tell My Heart." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">His daughter</a> covered an unreleased Fefe Dobson song, "Start All Over" for her first non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a> solo album, <em>Meet Miley Cyrus</em>. (Another unreleased Dobson song, "As A Blonde", would go on to be covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a> and the Scene a few years later.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pentatonix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pentatonix">Pentatonix</a> cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImogenHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImogenHeap">Imogen Heap</a>'s "Aha!" is more well-known. Just don't tell Imogen fans you prefer the cover.
</li><li> "Ai No Corrida" is usually thought of as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuincyJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuincyJones">Quincy Jones</a> song, but he was actually covering an unsuccessful solo single by Chas Jankel of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IanDuryAndTheBlockheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IanDuryAndTheBlockheads">Ian Dury and The Blockheads</a>.
</li><li> "Akaneiro" by John Zeroness is a cover of the song he wrote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tsukiuta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tsukiuta">Tsukiuta</a>'s September representative Yoru, "Koganeiro". It fixes the original's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a>, as well as changing the title in a way that might allude to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between Yoru and his partner, August representative You.
</li><li> "All Along the Watchtower" was written and first recorded in 1967 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>. Less than a year later, Dylan's original version would be forever eclipsed as the song was given a mind-bending reinterpretation by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, to the extent that Dylan's own live performances of the song have long been based around Hendrix's arrangement instead of his own.
</li><li> "All I Do Is Think Of You" has covered twice: by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Troop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Troop">Troop</a> in the 1980s and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/B5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/B5">B5</a> in the 2000s. The original is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive">The Jackson 5</a> and is from the '70s.
</li><li> "All I Want For Christmas Is You" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MariahCarey">Mariah Carey</a> is an inversion. Many people&mdash;especially those who were very young or not yet born when the song was released&mdash;refer to it as "Mariah Carey's version/cover", but her version isn't a cover at all. It's <em>her</em> song that she wrote and produced for her 1994 Christmas album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a>'s "All The Man I Need" was originally a Sister Sledge. Other songs from her that are actually covers include "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">I Will Always Love You</a>", "Greatest Love of All" and "Saving All My Love for You" (all seen below)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart">Heart</a>'s "Alone" was originally recorded in 1983 by its songwriters, Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly, under the name i-Ten.
</li><li> A rather convoluted example: Country music fans know "Always on My Mind" as a song by Willie Nelson, while pop music fans know it as a song by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a>. However, both artists were covering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s version of the song... which itself was not even the original version. The song was first performed by Brenda Lee, and obscure country singer John Wesley Ryles had a #20 hit with it before Nelson's version (under the title "You Are Always on My Mind"). And gamers know it as the song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillShatteredMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillShatteredMemories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a></em>.
</li><li> The Bacharach/David composition "Always Something There to Remind Me" is often associated with its well known cover by 80's new wave duo Naked Eyes, but it was recorded quite a few times, initially by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DionneWarwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DionneWarwick">Dionne Warwick</a> in 1963 (that version went unreleased, and she re-recorded a slightly better known version in 1967). In 1964, a re-recording was a UK #1 hit for Sandie Shaw.
<ul><li> Inverted by the Naked Eyes version: a Top 10 hit in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but barely noticed in Britain.
</li></ul></li><li> "Amarillo by Morning" was first recorded by one of its writers, Terry Stafford. It's been covered several times, including the best-known version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGuessWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGuessWho">The Guess Who</a>'s "American Woman" might have been overshadowed by the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LennyKravitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LennyKravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a> version - even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">the movie where that cover comes from</a> briefly features the original, which is also on the playlist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a>: World Tour</em>.
</li><li> Perry Como had a big hit with his cover of "And I Love You So," which was written and first performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonMcLean">Don McLean</a>.
</li><li> "Angel of Mine", by Monica. Betcha didn't know it was originally by a British girl group called Eternal.
</li><li> "Apache" is associated either with Danish jazz guitarist J&oslash;rgen Ingmann (in the U.S. and Canada) or with U.K. instrumental rock group The Shadows (in the U.K. and most of the rest of the world). Or in some circles with The Incredible Bongo Band, whose version provided a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">stock hip-hop sample</a>. The original version was by U.K. guitarist Bert Weedon, but the song's writer Jerry Lordan did not like his version and it only made #24 in the U.K.
</li><li> "At Last" is now universally associated with Etta James, who recorded it in 1961, but it was written in 1941 for the Glenn Miller Band. Many people might associate it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera">Christina Aguilera</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a>'s covers.
</li><li> "At Your Best (You Are Love)" was originally an Isley Brothers song dedicated to their mother before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a> covered it 14 years later.
</li><li> "The Awakening" is the name of a bass break that Les Claypool of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus">Primus</a> likes to throw into live versions of their song "Tommy The Cat." But originally it was its own song, written by the 1980's funk group, The Reddings.
</li><li> The Blake Babies' version of "Baby Gets High" is probably better known than the original by Madder Rose.
</li><li> McFly, "Baby's Coming Back", covering Jellyfish. This mainly has Covered Up status in the UK - In America neither version is too well known.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Boyzone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Boyzone">Boyzone</a> didn't write "Baby Can I Hold You"; that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TracyChapman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TracyChapman">Tracy Chapman</a>.
</li><li> "Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)" was originally written by rockabilly artist Moon Martin in 1978. It has been covered numerous times, but Robert Palmer's cover from 1979 was by far the most successful and is still the version that just about everyone associates with the song.
</li><li> In a particularly odd aversion, a number of songs which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimSteinman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimSteinman">Jim Steinman</a> wrote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a> were initially declined by him, and instead recorded on his solo album <em>Bad For Good</em> or by a pet project band of Steinman's called Pandora's Box. Meat Loaf himself eventually recorded a number of these songs, including the title track of "Bad For Good". Guess whose version is more widely known?
<ul><li> Taking it to an even further degree, Steinman's "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" was written for Meat Loaf, first recorded by Pandora's Box, was later covered by Celine Dion (whose version hit #1 on the US charts), and eventually came full circle when Meat Loaf sang it on his album <em>Bat Out Of Hell III</em>. Dion's version is probably the most familiar in America; Meat Loaf's version, however, a duet with Norweigan singer Marion Raven, made #1 in her home country, where the Dion version never charted.
</li></ul></li><li> Since the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em> Vol. 1, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cher">Cher</a>'s "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" has been completely eclipsed by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancySinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NancySinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>'s cover.
</li><li> "Barbara Ann" was first performed not by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>, nor even by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>, but by The Regents, which was easily the most popular version of the song.
</li><li> "Belfast" was initially written for Marcia Barrett in the early 1970s, then Gilla recorded a German cover. Nowadays only a version by Boney M. (with vocals by the same Marcia Barrett who had become a member of the band) is known, released a few months after Gilla's.
</li><li> "The Best" is best-known as one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner">Tina Turner</a>'s hit songs. It was originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler a year before Turner's version.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryAllan">Gary Allan</a>'s "Best I Ever Had" was first recorded by Vertical Horizon. Despite virtually no non-country music airplay, it outpeaked the original on the Hot 100 (51 vs. 58).
</li><li> "Bette Davis Eyes" was written and first recorded by Jackie DeShannon. Kim Carnes's version is the most famous.
</li><li> "Better by You, Better Than Me" was originally by Spooky Tooth; most people have only heard the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> version.
</li><li> "Beyond the Blue Horizon" is best known today from Lou Christie's 1974 recording, which featured on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Man</a></em> soundtrack. However, the song was written in 1930 for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonteCarlo1930" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonteCarlo1930">Monte Carlo</a>,</em> and it was one of star Jeanette MacDonald's signature pieces during her career. Meanwhile, Christie's rendition is very clearly patterned after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelNesmith">Michael Nesmith</a>'s version on his 1970 album <em>Magnetic South</em>.
</li><li> At least some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows">Counting Crows</a> fans were surprised to learn that "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Yellow_Taxi">Big Yellow Taxi<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> &mdash; and that her version was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">a third as long as the cover</a>, which shifted the emphasis from the general theme of loss ("Big yellow taxi/took my old man away") to the more specific (and already predominant) environmental message. Like "Misirlou" and "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)", the song is one of the most frequently recorded non-traditional pieces.
<ul><li> This happens to Mitchell a lot. She also wrote and recorded "Woodstock" and "Both Sides, Now", but the hit versions were by Crosby Stills &amp; Nash and Judy Collins, respectively.
</li><li> In turn most subsequent covers of "Woodstock" are based on the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash arrangement.
</li><li> Although the version that was a British #1 by Matthews Southern Comfort took a different tack altogether.
</li><li> Ditto "This Flight Tonight" covered by Nazareth.
</li><li> It was interpolated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson">Janet Jackson</a> in "Got 'Til It's Gone", from 1997.
</li><li> With "Both Sides, Now", she gave Collins first dibs, since at the time Collins was signed with a label and Mitchell wasn't yet.
</li><li> Bill and Hillary Clinton named their daughter "Chelsea" after hearing the Collins version of Joni's "Chelsea Morning". Chelsea herself tweeted she was named after "The Judy Collins Song".
</li></ul></li><li> "Big In Japan" was <em>not</em> originally performed by the Guano Apes (it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alphaville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alphaville">Alphaville</a> song).
</li><li> "Big Ten Inch Record" was a quarter-century old by the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a> got a hold of it.
</li><li> American music fans know "Billy Don't Be a Hero" as a song by Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods; however, the song was originally a UK hit for the band Paper Lace. Paper Lace wanted to have a U.S. hit with it, but Donaldson's version beat them to the top.
</li><li> "Black and White" was originally performed by Pete Seeger in 1956, followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SammyDavisJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SammyDavisJr">Sammy Davis Jr.</a>, its co-author Earl Robinson, the Maytones and Greyhound. Three Dog Night's version was a cover of the Greyhound version.
</li><li> "Black Betty" has been covered up to the point where it's barely visible. Many Australians think Spiderbait wrote it. Others think Ram Jam wrote it in 1990, but that version was a remix of that band's hit version of the song from 1977. Most people will associate it with the original Ram Jam version. It was associated with Lead Belly in the early 20th Century, but, like much of his repertoire, it predates even him. It may have existed in some form as far back as the 18th Century.
</li><li> How many think "Blame It On The Boogie", a 1978 hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive">the Jacksons</a>, was written by Michael Jackson? It was, but not THAT Michael Jackson. An Englishman (Mick Jackson) wrote it (along with his brother David and Elmar Krohn), recorded it first and his version made the UK charts at around the same time as the (US) Jacksons version, but only the latter is remembered today.
</li><li> "Blinded by the Light" was written and sung by Bruce Springsteen. Manfred Mann's Earth Band made it famous &mdash; they also added one of the most infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">mondegreens</a> in music, "wrapped up like a douche". (The real lyric is "revved up like a deuce [coupe]", and they could have avoided it if they kept Springsteen's original, "cut loose like a deuce".)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManfredMann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManfredMann">Manfred Mann</a> also covered "For You" by Springsteen. And "Spirit in the Night" as well (although unlike "Blinded by the Light", those songs are today <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstAndForemost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstAndForemost">First and Foremost</a> Springsteen's). Manfred Mann really liked covering Bruce's songs.
</li><li> Manfred Mann's Earth Band also covered "Singing the Dolphins Through" on the same album, which was originally written and performed by Mike Heron on his 1975 album <em>Mike Heron's Reputation</em>. Nobody remembers Heron's version.
</li><li> Also, Springsteen wrote "Because the Night", which singer/poet Patti Smith made into a hit after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">gender-flipping</a> his lyrics. It was most famously covered in the early 90's by college-rockers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TenThousandManiacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TenThousandManiacs">10,000 Maniacs</a> on their <em>MTV Unplugged</em> performance.
</li><li> Springsteen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">got smart to this trope the third time around,</a> and recorded "Hungry Heart" himself instead of giving it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a> like he originally planned.
</li><li> Springsteen has been on the other side of this as well. "Jersey Girl" a hit for Springsteen was originally a Tom Waits song, released on his album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeartattackAndVine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeartattackAndVine">Heartattack and Vine</a></em>.
</li><li> "Blood on Fire", better known from the Eurobeat version by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Go2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Go2">Go 2</a> &amp; Christine, was originally by the Japanese rock group AAA, used as the opening for the Japanese dub of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Initial D</a></em>. Similarly, John Desire's version of "Hot Limit" is more famous than the TM Revolution original, particularly due to appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> and the animutation "We Drink Ritalin".
</li></ul></li><li> People tend to remember the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindaRonstadt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindaRonstadt">Linda Ronstadt</a> version of Blue Bayou more than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a> original.
</li><li> "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" was written by Fred Rose to be recorded by his friend, legendary country singer Roy Acuff (the ubiquitous "Acuff-Rose" Publishing company of many classic country songs), and was covered several years later by Hank Williams Sr. However, by far the most famous version is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a>'s 1975 cover from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHeadedStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHeadedStranger">Red Headed Stranger</a></em>.
</li><li> A number of songs by the King himself (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>) are covers &mdash; for example, "Blue Suede Shoes" was originally by Carl Perkins.
<ul><li> His classic "Love Me Tender", while the lyrics were new, borrowed the tune of "Aura Lee" (published in 1861) note-for-note.
</li><li> Quite a few Elvis songs borrowed their tunes from older songs while having original lyrics. Other examples are "It's Now or Never" ("'O Sole Mio", published 1898) and "Wooden Heart" ("Muss I Denn", published 1827).
</li><li> "Hound Dog" is another, first recorded by blues singer Big Mama Thorton. There's a reason Elvis is sometimes known as "The Prince of Thieves."
</li><li> His first single "That's All Right (Mama)" was originally performed by blues singer Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup.
</li><li> Elvis's "Can't Help Falling In Love With You" received a very popular cover by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UB40" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UB40">UB 40</a>, it was a wedding reception favorite in the early 90's.
</li><li> "Blue Christmas" was first recorded by Doye O'Dell in 1948, and then three times in the following year one by country artist Ernest Tubb; one by bandleader Hugo Winterhalter and his orchestra; and one by bandleader Russ Morgan and his orchestra. Tubb's version spent the first week of January 1950 at No. 1 on Billboard Country &amp; Western Records chart, while Winterhalter's version peaked at No. 9 on Billboard's Disk Jockeys chart and Morgan's version reached No. 11 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart. In 1950 Billy Eckstine recorded a new version. but it became Elvis' when he recorded it for his 1957 LP <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisChristmasAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisChristmasAlbum">Elvis Christmas Album</a></em>. Presley actually <strong>didn't</strong> want to record the song, and told his background singers to mess up the take so it wouldn't be released. This lead to the soprano "woo eee wooo" lines in the background that the song became especially known for.
</li></ul></li><li> Most people don't even realize "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Bobby</a> McGee" was originally <em>female</em>, in the song by Kris Kristofferson. Janis Joplin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">made him a man</a>. It's generally accepted that Kristofferson, who was Joplin's lover for a time, wrote the song about her; that is, when Joplin sings about "Bobby McGee," she's singing about herself!
</li><li> "Bring the Pain" is a song by Method Man, a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WuTangClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WuTangClan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>; however, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MindlessSelfIndulgence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MindlessSelfIndulgence">Mindless Self Indulgence</a> fans are far more familiar with the band's cover of the song from <em>Tight.</em>
</li><li> "Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter" was originally a solo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a> track for the soundtrack of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet5TheDreamChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet5TheDreamChild">A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child</a></em>. He re-recorded it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a> the following year.
</li><li> "Broken Arrow" was written by Robbie Robertson, formerly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand">The Band</a>, and first recorded on Robertson's first solo album. Several years later it became a huge hit for Rod Stewart.
</li><li> Three artists released "Butterfly Kisses" in the same year: Bob Carlisle, Raybon Brothers and Jeff Carson. Carlisle's (the original) was a big hit on adult contemporary and pop radio but didn't enter the Billboard Hot 100 due a chart quirk involving a lack of physical single release; as a result, only the Raybon Brothers' cover made it into the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. Given that both artists were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One Hit Wonders</a> (although Marty Raybon was previously a member of the successful 1990s band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah">Shenandoah</a>), this is an especially unusual case of covering up.
<ul><li> There were several instances of songs from that time period where one artist would release a cover version because the version on the radio was unavailable as a single.
</li></ul></li><li> "Burnin' Down the House" is well-known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a> song...in North America, where it was the band's highest charging single in 1983. Younger listeners, particularly ones from the UK and Australia (where the original, at best, barely charted), are more likely to think of the 1999 cover by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomJones">Tom Jones</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCardigans">The Cardigans</a>.
</li><li> "The Candy Man" was originally performed by Aubrey Woods in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, but for a time the song was more famous for Sammy Davis Jr.'s cover. Davis actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">could have</a> sung the song in the film - he expressed interest in the role of the candy store owner, but was turned down. The original version became better known than the Davis' cover as time went on because changing musical tastes meant the film continued to be broadcast long after Davis' version stopped receiving airplay.
</li><li> &#147;Candle in the Wind&#148; is a bizarre example of an artist doing this to himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> originally wrote the song to be about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, but he wrote a second version of the song after the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Princess Diana</a>, which he preformed at her funeral. The version about Diana is far more famous than the original about Marylin Monroe.
</li><li> "Can't Get Enough Of You Baby" was not originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth">Smash Mouth</a>. The Toys were the first to record it way back in 1965, and the 4 Seasons and ? and the Mysterians (whose better-known hit, "96 Tears," has a similar opening stinger) soon after that. Those who came of age in the 80's will also remember the version by British new wave band The Colourfield.
</li><li> "Captain Neo", the attract theme of <em>Metal Soldier Isaac II</em>, is better known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Level1MusicRepresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Level1MusicRepresents">Zone A theme</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius">Darius</a></em>, both of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Taito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Taito">Taito</a> games.
</li><li> "Caravan of Love" is one of the two songs most associated with The Housemartins, but was originally by Isley Jasper Isley, an offshoot group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIsleyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIsleyBrothers">The Isley Brothers</a>.
</li><li> "Cat's Eye" by Anri is the opening song from the anime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em> from 1983. Younger people may be more familiar with the cover from 2000 by E-Rotic, with the lyrics rewritten in English, especially because this cover was included in several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bemani">BEMANI</a> games (including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a> 4th Mix Plus</em> and <em>5th Mix</em>, <em>Dance Maniax 2nd Mix</em>, and <em>Dance Dance Revolution Music Fit</em>). Likewise, several other popular <em>DDR</em> songs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion">translated cover versions</a> of J-Pop songs, such as Bambee's "17" and Judy Crystal's "God of Romance (Romansu no Kamisama)".
</li><li> Many younger people will associate "Cat's in the Cradle" with Ugly Kid Joe rather than Harry Chapin.
</li><li> "Cancer" wasn't as popular as "Dead", "The Black Parade", or "I'm Not Okay", but it is a well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a> song. However, many teens and young adults recognize the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyOnePilots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwentyOnePilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> version of the song before the MCR one. My Chemical Romance disbanded before TOP became popular, plus many Twenty One Pilot fans are too young to remember MCR in its heyday well.
</li><li> In 1982, just after he left The Babys, John Waite reached #16 on the US chart with "Change," originally written and performed by Spider, a band that few remember. Spider also gave us Anton Fig, drummer for the band on Late Night with David Letterman.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a>'s famous little acoustic tune "Change the World" is awesome. It's also a Wynonna Judd cover.
</li><li> "Chicken Fried" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand">Zac Brown Band</a> had a circuitous history which ends up being an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defiance</a> of this trope. Although they had played it for several years, they gave the song to another group called The Lost Trailers in 2006. Zac Brown then changed his mind about giving them the song, so the Trailers' version was withdrawn. ZBB then released "Chicken Fried" as their major-label debut in 2008.
</li><li> "China Girl" is best known for David Bowie's 1983 hit version from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetsDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetsDance">Let's Dance</a></em>, but it was first performed by Iggy Pop (and co-written with Bowie) in 1977 on his album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIdiot">The Idiot</a></em>. The covering up was ultimately pretty beneficial to the original artist, which may have been the point: Iggy Pop was nearing bankruptcy at the time, and receiving substantial royalties for the Bowie version helped him out financially.
</li><li> "Cinderella" has been performed by artists such as Play, Tata Young, and most famously The Cheetah Girls. It was written and first sung by a relatively unknown girl group i5.
</li><li> Most folks know "City of New Orleans" because of either Willie Nelson or Arlo Guthrie, but the original belongs to Steve Goodman and dates back to 1971.
</li><li> Most people aren't aware that the Candy Mountain song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/CharlieTheUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/CharlieTheUnicorn">Charlie the Unicorn</a></em> is actually to the tune of a song called "Clarinet Polka" that dates back all the way to the 19th century.
</li><li> "Close to You" was first done by Richard Chamberlain. The only version that <em>matters,</em> apparently, was performed by The Carpenters. And written by neither, but by Burt Bacharach/Hal David.
</li><li> "Come and Get Your Love" was originally recorded by Redbone in 1973. Those who grew up in the '90s more likely know Real McCoy's 1995 Euro-reggae cover. (This may have changed since the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>, due to its prominent use at the start.)
</li><li> "Common People" was written and first performed by the indie band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pulp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pulp">Pulp</a> but it was popularized in the USA by a cover version done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>. This is only in the USA however, as in the the UK and Ireland the original is still one of the most beloved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> songs of the 1990's.
</li><li> Patsy Cline's signature song, "Crazy", was in fact written by Willie Nelson, and later covered by him.
</li><li> "Crimson and Clover", by Tommy James and the Shondells. Joan Jett covered it, keeping the gender lyrics (because 'clover' doesn't rhyme with 'know him'), so now you have a punk goddess singing a love song to another woman, added killer guitar riffs, and removed that warbly vocal thing. Her version is now better known in some circles(despite only reaching #7 instead of #1 like the original).
<ul><li> Speaking of Clapton, "After Midnight" and "Cocaine" were by J.J. Cale. As was "Call Me The Breeze," which most know as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> song. How about "Behind The Mask"? That was by Japanese electro-pop group Yellow Magic Orchestra. There were some extra verses in Clapton's version that weren't in YMO's, however; those were written by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>! Michael's version of "Behind The Mask" was cut from the line-up of 'Thriller.' And of course, he Covered Up himself with the slow version of <em>Layla</em>, (though it's not as well-known today as the Derek &amp; The Dominos version) which won him a Grammy.
</li></ul></li><li> At least in Europe, &#147;Crying in the Rain&#148; is an a-ha song. Who are the Everly Brothers anyway.
</li><li> Cream's "Crossroads" was originally "Cross Road Blues" by Robert Johnson.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot">Quiet Riot</a>'s covers of "Cum On Feel The Noize" and "Mama Weer All Crazee Now," both by '70s British rock band Slade. Quiet Riot covered these up in America, but the Slade versions were two of the best-selling singles of the 70s in Britain.
</li><li> The semi-satirical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance">Queer Romance</a> ballad "Cowboys are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other" was originally penned in 1981 by Ned Sublette, but was largely unknown until covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a>. Ironically, some people think that the covers by either The Lost Dakotas or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PansyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PansyDivision">Pansy Division</a> was the original version, when in fact Nelson was familiar with the original long before the making of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></em> and had been singing it in live performances for decades before recording it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchPerfect">Pitch Perfect</a></em>'s "Cup Song" (better known by the title "When I'm Gone"), is a partial cover of an old Carter Family (of which June is an offspring) song called "Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone".
</li><li> Toploader&#146;s 2000 hit &#147;Dancing in the Moonlight&#148; was originally a hit for King Harvest in 1972. But the original version was by a band called Boffalongo, who released their version in 1970. King Harvest's version remains the most known in the U.S., however.
</li><li> Wendy Matthews' 1992 recording of "The Day You Went Away" is a classic of Australian pop. Few people know it was actually written and first recorded by an obscure British group, Soul Family Sensation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> have a few of these. "Dazed and Confused" was written by Jake Holmes, a folk-pop musician best known for writing commercial jingles, including the "Be All That You Can Be" jingle for the U.S. Army. (Aside from "I've been dazed and confused", Jimmy Page entirely discarded Holmes' lyrics and wrote new ones for the Zeppelin recording.) "Whole Lotta Love" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelinII">Led Zeppelin II</a></em> 's lyrics come from a Willie Dixon song, and the arrangement the group used was based on a cover by the Small Faces. "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You" was written by an early 60s folkie named Anne Johannson Bredon (and erroneously credited as a traditional song when Zep recorded it). "When the Levee Breaks" was by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy. "In My Time of Dying" was a Blind Willie Johnson song. "The Lemon Song" contains elements of Robert Johnson's "Travellin' Riverside Blues" and Muddy Waters' "Killing Floor". "How Many More Times" was a Howlin' Wolf song. "Gallows Pole" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads">an old English folk song</a>.
<ul><li> Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy didn't write "When The Levee Breaks", it's a folk-blues standard that describes the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.
</li></ul></li><li> "December Prayer" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdinaMenzel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdinaMenzel">Idina Menzel</a> was originally recorded by Yvonne Catterfield. The song was cowritten by Menzel, so she sort of covered herself up.
</li><li> Bruce Springsteen's "Devil with a Blue Dress On" is based on Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels' uptempo version of the 1964 Shorty Long original. It wasn't always a medley with "Good Golly Miss Molly".
</li><li> "Desenchantee" was a #1 hit for Mylene Farmer in her native France in 1991, but outside France, the better-known version has been the 2002 Eurotrance cover by Belgian diva Kate Ryan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>'s "Die Moritat von Mackie Messer", the opening piece from his <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheThreepennyOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheThreepennyOpera">The Threepenny Opera</a></em>, was translated to English nearly 30 years after its composition as "Mack the Knife", whereupon Louis Armstrong (and later Bobby Darin) made it into a hit.
<ul><li> While we're on the subject of Brecht, a song from Brecht and Weill's <em>The Rise and Fall of the State of Mahagonny</em> was covered by the Doors as "Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLivingTombstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLivingTombstone">The Living Tombstone</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk">remix<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the Odyssey song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes">Discord<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" has overtaken the original to the point that it has over <em>five times</em> more views on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> than the latter. Since Odyssey has also covered a whole lot of songs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> as well as others from the fandom under the Eurobeat Brony moniker, it's a common misconception that Tombstone's version is the original and Odyssey's version is the cover, although it's clearly Odyssey who's singing in both version.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyConnolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyConnolly">Billy Connolly</a>'s "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" became a case of both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">"Weird Al" Effect</a> when it hit #1 in Britain in 1975, since not only was it more successful than Tammy Wynette's 1968 original (which got to #12 on the British charts), but Connolly's parody lyrics were mostly borrowed from "D-I-V-O-R-C-E #2", released in 1969 by Sheb Wooley under his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongParody">Song Parody</a> alias Ben Colder.
</li><li> The Wiggles' 1994 children's hit "Do The Monkey" was originally recorded by the Cockroaches 5 years earlier. Since two members of The Wiggles originally played together in The Cockroaches, they sort of covered themselves up.
</li><li> Insomuch as one can cover up a song they wrote with a different band: "Do Ya" was first written by Jeff Lynne as a late single by The Move - it later got much more exposure when he remade it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a>. Similarly, Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks first recorded "Crystal" <em>before</em> they joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>, while Mac's earlier "Sentimental Lady" became a bigger hit when writer Bob Welch recorded a solo take after he left the band (with several other Fleetwood Mac members on the track as well). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> had a minor hit with "Hello It's Me" with Nazz before having a much bigger hit with it as a solo artist. (Incidentally, Rundgren <em>also</em> covered "Do Ya" with his band Utopia, and that might have spurred on the Electric Light Orchestra recording - ELO had just started including the song in their live performances when, according to drummer Bev Bevan, a music journalist asked them about "the original version" by Utopia)
</li><li> "Don't Cha", by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussycatDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PussycatDolls">Pussycat Dolls</a>? Also a cover &mdash; of a song first recorded by Tori Alamaze, one year before the Pussycat Dolls performed it.
</li><li> "Don't Leave Me This Way" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">zig-zagged</a> this in several ways. It was first recorded as an album track by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes (featuring Teddy Pendergrass) in 1975. Two years later, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco">Disco</a> version by Thelma Houston became a #1 hit in the US. It was a Top 20 hit in the UK as well, and in response, the Blue Notes' original was released as a single and outpaced Houston on the British charts, peaking at #5. Then in 1986 the Hi-NRG version by The Communards became a massive #1 hit in the UK (it also snuck into the US Top 40, but the Thelma Houston version is still the best-known one in the States).
</li><li> The Animals didn't write "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood". It was first performed by Nina Simone. Even the Animals version has been forgotten by some fans of the later Santa Esmeralda cover, especially after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em>.
</li><li> "Don't Turn Around" is known for two hit versions, by Aswad and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AceOfBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AceOfBase">Ace of Base</a>, however, it was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner">Tina Turner</a> song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Spoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Spoon">Spoon</a>'s "Don't You Evah," the second single from <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em>, is a cover of "Don't You Ever" by The Natural History, which appeared on an album that came out several months <em>after</em> <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2f1qd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2f1qd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2f1qd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the Natural History's third album was recorded in 2004, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> held the release back until 2007, two years after the group themselves broke up</span>. Spoon were kind enough to include the original on the EP single release of "Don't You Evah", however.
</li><li> "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" was originally recorded by girl group The Exciters (best remembered for "Tell Him"). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">slightly altered cover</a> by Manfred Mann is much more popular.
</li><li> The Robert John "Mutt" Lange-written "Do You Believe in Love" is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HueyLewisAndTheNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HueyLewisAndTheNews">Huey Lewis and the News</a>' best-known songs, but it had originally been recorded three years earlier by the British group Supercharge.
</li><li> Most Americans think of "Do You Wanna Touch Me" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett">Joan Jett</a> song. It was a big hit for the American punk rocker in 1982, and still sees some airplay in America today. The original version was recorded and co-written by UK glam rocker <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryGlitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryGlitter">Gary Glitter</a> in 1973...and thanks to his multiple convictions for child molestation and possession of hardcore child pornography, his version doesn't see airplay anywhere. This has actually caused a few problems; British <em>Glee</em> fans were not amused when "Do You Wanna Touch Me" was covered by the show, and an 2008 Hewlett-Packard TV commercial featuring the Joan Jett version was pulled once HP learned that a convicted child molester wrote the song...and was getting royalties from their ad!
</li><li> "Dreamland" a song made famous by Bunny Wailer in 1971 (and other recordings), is actually a cover of El Tempos' "My Dream Island". Not only was the original obscure, but Bunny credited himself as the songwriter (and continues to do so). As a result, it took many years before anyone discovered the original. El Tempos have never been paid royalties for the song.
</li><li> "Drift Away" was written by Mentor Williams (brother of famed composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulWilliams">Paul Williams</a>) and first performed by John Henry Kurtz. Dobie Gray's version is the most famous, although Uncle Kracker's cover (in which Gray still gets credit) is also well-known.

</li><li> "Emotion", best known nowadays as a hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild">Destiny's Child</a>, is a cover of an old song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees">The Bee Gees</a>. (Well, technically, Samantha Sang <em>featuring</em> the Bee Gees, but anyhow...)
</li><li> Many people know of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OwlCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OwlCity">Owl City</a>'s cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>'s "Enchanted" before they learn of the original. This is despite the cover being a "reply" to Taylor and repeatedly mentioning her.
</li><li> "Eve of Destruction" was written for (and originally recorded by) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles">The Turtles</a>, but it was Barry McGuire's version that became a hit.
</li><li> "Every Other Time" is actually a parody of LFO's "Every Other Time". A lot of people thought it was a Bob Ricci original song, even though the LFO version was more successful.
</li><li> "Even If It Breaks Your Heart" by the Eli Young Band is a cover of Will Hoge.
</li><li> "Everlasting Love" was first performed by Robert Knight in 1967. Since then, it has been covered by practically everyone under the sun. Some of the most famous covers were by Love Affair (in 1968), Carl Carlton (in 1974), Rex Smith &amp; Rachel Sweet (in 1981), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloriaEstefan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloriaEstefan">Gloria Estefan</a> (in 1995) and Jamie Cullum (in 2003).
</li><li> Rozalla's "Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)" was a major dance hit and a minor pop hit in the early '90s, but the original has mostly been forgotten, at least in North America, where the better-known version is Quindon Tarver's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SofterAndSlowerCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SofterAndSlowerCover">Softer and Slower Cover</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet">William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet</a></em>.
</li><li> "Everybody's Talkin'" was written by Fred Neil, but is most often connected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryNilsson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HarryNilsson">Harry Nilsson</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong">soundtrack from</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightCowboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightCowboy">Midnight Cowboy</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">Lorde</a>'s cover of "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" has officially become this with younger audiences, with her version showing up first on Google. The original song is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears">Tears for Fears</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada">Cascada</a> song, "Everytime We Touch," is known by a good majority of America. Not nearly as many know it was by Maggie Reilly. Cascada only used the chorus of the song; bands such as Trixiana, Lacara, and Trinity have done full covers of the song that are not nearly as prolific.
</li><li> The '80s ballad "Everytime You Go Away", made a hit single by Paul Young, was written and first performed by Hall and Oates. All of Paul Young's American hits were covers, although the aforementioned song is the only one most people likely remember.
</li><li> "EZ DO DANCE" is much better known as Prizmmy's theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmRainbowLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmRainbowLive">Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live</a></em> than as TRF's 1993 hit. Eventually both versions got covered up by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism">King of Prism</a></em>'s versions, with newer audiences considering it to be the spinoff's own theme rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to its inspiration.
</li><li> Electric Youth's "Faces" (2009) is a remake of a little-known Italo-disco gem by Clio (1985). Similarly, "Flame" by Tiziana Rivale is a remake of another nearly-unknown song by Luna &amp; Black Connection.
</li><li> Great White's "Face the Day" was originally by the criminally underrated Australian band The Angels (known in the U.S as Angel City).
</li><li> Some people don't know that "Family Man" by Hall &amp; Oates is a cover of Mike Oldfield. May be a bit justified since Oldfield isn't well known in the U.S. aside from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells">Tubular Bells</a>."
</li><li> "Father and Son" is by Cat Stevens, not by Ronan Keating or Boyzone.
</li><li> "Feel Good Time" is kind of an odd case, as the original version was never officially released: It was written by Beck and William Orbit for a scrapped collaboration-heavy Orbit solo album, but it became a hit when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a> ended up performing it for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharliesAngelsFullThrottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharliesAngelsFullThrottle">Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle</a></em> soundtrack. The producers of the soundtrack wanted the Beck version, but he didn't want to appear on the soundtrack himself, though he didn't mind the song being covered. The backing track for her version is in fact exactly the same as what would have been the Beck version, but with his vocals and guitar part mixed out.
<ul><li> William Orbit leaked the Beck version himself, with Beck's permission.
</li></ul></li><li> "Fields Of People" was originally written and performed by American art-rock group Ars Nova, however, their career flopped so badly that the people who know of the song most likely have only heard the version performed by British pop group The Move.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam">Space Jam</a></em> soundtrack features examples from both ends: Seal covered up "Fly Like An Eagle" (Steve Miller Band; still the better-known version today, at least in North America), while All For One's "I Turn To You" only became well-known after a version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristinaAguilera">Christina Aguilera</a> (which is still more associated with her than them).
</li><li> "Fly Me to the Moon" is generally recognized as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> song, but it was originally a cabaret song in waltz time called "In Other Words". For Sinatra and the Count Basie Orchestra's version from "It Might as Well be Swing", Quincy Jones changed the time signature and gave it a swing rhythm. People would end up associating Sinatra's version of the song with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, and later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em>.
</li><li> A popular European nightclub song in 2003 was XTM's <em>Fly On The Wings of Love</em>. It is unknown how many were aware that, as a ballad, it was the winning song for Denmark in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a></em> three years earlier.
</li><li> In the USA, "Flying Without Wings" was covered up by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> winner Ruben Studdard. The original version was by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife">Westlife</a>, and featured in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">Pok&eacute;mon 2000</a></em>.
</li><li> Australians have enjoyed Youth Group's rendition of "Forever Young", without realizing it belongs to German synthpop-menschen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alphaville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alphaville">Alphaville</a>. In the US the original is probably the best-known, due to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em>.
</li><li> Although Eric Paslay wrote his only big hit "Friday Night", it was originally cut by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyAntebellum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyAntebellum">Lady Antebellum</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler">Bette Midler</a>'s version of "From a Distance" is much better known than the first recording by Nanci Griffith.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Placebo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Placebo">Placebo</a> cover of "Fuck You" is more well-known than the Archive original.
</li><li> "The Gael" was commissioned for the historical Loss Nech Monster Centre by Scottish musician Dougie MacLean. Nowadays, it's best known as the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastOfTheMohicans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastOfTheMohicans">The Last of the Mohicans</a></em>, as composed by Trevor Jones.
</li><li> Power metal band Gamma Ray covered "Gamma ray", from <em>Hoodoo Man</em> by Birth Control.
</li><li> "Get Together" is best known for the 1967 version by The Youngbloods, but was first recorded in 1964 by The Kingston Trio (under the title "Let's Get Together"). Neither artist actually wrote the song - it was written by Chet Powers, best known for founding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychedelicRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychedelicRock">Psychedelic Rock</a> group Quicksilver Messenger Service (under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageName">Stage Name</a> Dino Valenti).
</li><li> "Georgia on My Mind" was written and performed by Hoagy Carmichael. No one thinks it's anything but a Ray Charles original today. Well, except for those who think of it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a> song.
</li><li> "Ghost Riders in the Sky" was first recorded by Stan Jones in 1948, and performed by countless other singers since then; however, the version best known to present-day listeners is that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>, from his 1979 album <em>Silver</em>.
</li><li> You might know that Milli Vanilli weren't the first to sing of "Girl You Know It's True". (You're more likely to know that <em>they didn't sing it at all</em>.) But few remember the original performers, Numarx.
</li><li> While "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" is typically thought of as a "girl power"-type song because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>'s success with the song, some might be surprised to learn that it was written by a man (Robert Hazard) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">was originally sung from a male perspective</a>. A younger generation might know the song from its revved-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> version from <em>Breakout</em>.
</li><li> "The Girls of Rock and Roll" first appeared in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMalibuBikiniShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMalibuBikiniShop">The Malibu Bikini Shop</a></em>, but people might have stronger memories of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheChipmunkAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheChipmunkAdventure">The Chipmunk Adventure</a></em> version, performed by the Chipmunks and the Chipettes.
</li><li> "The Girl With One Eye" was originally by Ludes, but the original is much harder to find in comparison to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlorenceAndTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlorenceAndTheMachine">Florence + the Machine</a>'s cover.
</li><li> "Give a Little Bit" was not written by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GooGooDolls">Goo Goo Dolls</a>, but by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Supertramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Supertramp">Supertramp</a>.
</li><li> The Shadows of Knight cover of "Gloria" was a much bigger hit (and gets much more radio play) than the original recording by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> and Them, at least in the US. This was mostly due to the original's too-suggestive lyrics "she comes in my room". Nowadays, everything has flip-flopped. Arguably, the live version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors">The Doors</a> is the best-known nowadays.
</li><li> A number of Laura Branigan's hits ("Gloria" and "Self Control", for example) were covers of Italian pop songs.
</li><li> "Go West" was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VillagePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VillagePeople">Village People</a> song, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a> version seems considerably more popular.
</li><li> "Go Where You Wanna Go", a hit for The Fifth Dimension, was originally an album cut by The Mamas and the Papas.
</li><li> "God Gave Me You," made famous by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton">Blake Shelton</a>, was originally released by Christian musician Dave Barnes.
</li><li> "God Gave Rock and Roll to You" was originally by Argent. That the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a> version is generally better known - (not to mention the fact that they changed some of the lyrics and added their own names to the writing credit - their song has a "II" added to the title for a reason) annoys Rod Argent no end.
<ul><li> In certain circles (primarily religious ones), the Petra versions (1977 and 1984) are better known. They feature different lyrics from both the Argent original and the Kiss cover. Petra lyricist Bob Hartman mentioned fans asking him "why they let Kiss cover their song." He would laugh and gently inform them that both were covers.
</li></ul></li><li> The lyrics of "God Save The King" were rewritten for the song "America" (which is more commonly known as "My Country 'Tis of Thee"). Thus the jarring experience, for Americans, of hearing the British playing (usually without lyrics) what they think of as an American song.
<ul><li> It's even more jarring when you remember that it's the British <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnthem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnthem">National Anthem</a></strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult">Blue &Ouml;yster Cult</a> were first off the block with a tune called <em>Goin' Thru the Motions</em>. Co-written by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IanHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IanHunter">Ian Hunter</a> for his band, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MottTheHoople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MottTheHoople">Mott the Hoople</a> had the first British hit with the song, and it was later covered by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonnieTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonnieTyler">Bonnie Tyler</a> who had an Eighties hit with it.
</li><li> "Got My Mind Set On You" was made famous by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> in 1988, but it was written by Rudy Clark and performed by James Ray in 1962. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> parody even kind of rips on Harrison for his lyrical ability (or lack thereof) with the line, "Couldn't think of any lyrics. No, I never wrote the lyrics."
</li><li> "Got the Time" is generally associated with the 1990 thrash mental version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax">Anthrax</a> but was written and first recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeJackson">Joe Jackson</a> in 1978.
</li><li> Who remembers George Benson's version of "Greatest Love of All", since Whitney Houston? (Between Benson's and Houston's versions, it was covered by a few other people such as Leslie Uggams and Ben Vereen.)
</li><li> "The Green Manilishi (with the Two-Pronged Crown)" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a> song from back when Peter Green was the singer and lead guitarist, but today most people only know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> version.
</li><li> Many people might not know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a>' "A Groovy Kind of Love", featured in the late-'80s movie <em>Buster</em>, is a slower, ballad-styled cover of a '60s uptempo pop song... but those who know this fact may not know that the original version <em>wasn't</em> done by the Mindbenders, but by the relatively-obscure duo Diane &amp; Anitta, in 1965.
</li><li> As of 2015, "Half the World Away" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis">Oasis</a> appears to be falling into this via the cover by Aurora Aksnes, almost entirely due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong">John Lewis commercial</a> featuring that particular version.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffBuckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffBuckley">Jeff Buckley</a>'s cover of "Hallelujah" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grace">Grace</a></em>) is by far the one everyone knows; the original is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonardCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonardCohen">Leonard Cohen</a> and was originally written as an obscure album track on his 1984 project <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VariousPositions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VariousPositions">Various Positions</a></em> (and adapted from a poem with an eyewatering 80 verses). Other than the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, no other medium uses the original. Either the Buckley or the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KDLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KDLang">KD Lang</a> fans can lead you in a non-Cohen direction. Even more curiously, Buckley's version is really a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCale">John Cale</a>'s, which is significantly different from Cohen's original (and recorded for a Cohen tribute album, no less). Just about everyone's cover is based on the Cale version, either directly or via Buckley. With a few notable exceptions, such as the U2 version, or Bob Dylan's live cover. And it was covered up <em>again</em> in the UK by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">The X Factor</a></em> 2008 winner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlexandraBurke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlexandraBurke">Alexandra Burke</a>'s version. More recently, k.d. lang's version (which she performed at the 2010 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>) is considered the definitive one, at least in Canada. (Although between the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> and the Olympics, the Rufus Wainwright version was considered definitive). According to one fan site over <em>two thousand</em> covers are known to exist.
<ul><li> Let's take this one further and just say anything by Leonard Cohen in general has been Covered Up. Has something to do with the fact he's a mindblowingly fantastic songwriter but only just adequate as a performer (a few songs notwithstanding).
</li><li> Not the case with the Flying Lizards cover of "Suzanne" which sounds as if they used malfunctioning Cybermen for session musicians.
</li><li> Let's not get started on Justin Timberlake's version...
</li></ul></li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesTaylor">James Taylor</a>'s best hits, "Handyman", released in 1977, was originally written by singer Jimmy Jones and songwriter Otis Blackwell back in 1959. He got two number one hits off of covers, as well: "You've Got a Friend" (originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaroleKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CaroleKing">Carole King</a>) and "How Sweet it is (To Be Loved By You)" (originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye">Marvin Gaye</a>.)
</li><li> "Hanging on the Telephone", a very popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie">Blondie</a> song, was originally released in 1976 by a little-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> band called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emy5mA8Ixtc">The Nerves.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> "Hard Sun", the 2007 single from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Eddie Vedder's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWild">Into the Wild</a></em> soundtrack, was originally performed in 1989 by singer/songwriter Indio, aka Gordon Peterson. The covering up is pretty understandable: the original was only a small hit in it's time, and was from Indio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">only album</a>, <em>Big Harvest</em>.
</li><li> "Hard to Handle" is originally an Otis Redding song. And he made it famous. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackCrowes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackCrowes">The Black Crowes</a> thoroughly covered it up.
</li><li> "Heart and Soul" was written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, and first recorded by Exile. The Bus Boys also recorded it, but the version by Huey Lewis and the News is the most famous and the only one which hit the top 10 on the Billboard singles chart.
</li><li> Jose Gonzales found fame through the use in a commercial of his acoustic cover of electropop song "Heartbeats" by The Knife.
</li><li> "Heart of Asia", a 1999 trance anthem by Watergate, is actually a cover of the theme tune from the 1983 Anglo-Japanese war film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MerryChristmasMrLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MerryChristmasMrLawrence">Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</a></em>, composed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YellowMagicOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YellowMagicOrchestra">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>.
</li><li> While not exactly a cover in that his rendition had already been used to promote the show before it even started, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>'s version of "Hello, Dolly!" is known much better than any of those featured in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HelloDolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HelloDolly">the titular musical</a>. So much so that for the screen adaptation of the musical they wrote in an otherwise completely out of place Louis cameo just so he could perform at least a part of the song.
</li><li> John Kongos' song "He's Gonna Step On You Again" was covered up by the Happy Mondays who retitled their version as "Step On". Years later, Def Leppard made their own cover in an arrangement more like the original.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a> actually covered <em>themselves</em> with the song "Here I Go Again." They released the original as a European-only single in 1982 and it peaked at #34 in the UK. In 1987, at the urging of their record label, they re-recorded a more polished and up-tempo version of the song and put it out as a single again. This "cover version" shot to #9 in the UK and #1 in the United States, and became the version that everyone knows and radio stations still play - the original has been largely forgotten by everyone but hardcore Whitesnake fans.
</li><li> In an Argentinian example, the band Metropoli recorded the song "Heroes Anonimos", but were the band Catupecu Machu the ones who popularized it.
</li><li> For some people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BryanAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BryanAdams">Bryan Adams</a>' "Heaven" was eclipsed by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i7g9ccjkc8">the Eurodance cover made in 2001<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, by DJ Sammy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada">Yanou</a>, and Dutch singer Do. For comparison, the original was a #1 in the U.S. and the cover topped the UK charts (while reaching #8 in the US as well).
</li><li> Think "Hey Baby" (not to be confused with the song of the same name by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a>) was originally by DJ &Ouml;tzi? Wrong - his version (properly titled "Hey Baby (Uhh, Ahh)", possibly to avoid confusing it with the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a> song) was a cover of "Hey! Baby" by Bruce Channel, also found on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing">Dirty Dancing</a></em> soundtrack.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>'s first hit, "Hey Joe", which appeared on the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AreYouExperienced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AreYouExperienced">Are You Experienced</a></em>, was written by... some obscure Californian folksinger dude named Billy Roberts. A Dutch book about the stories behind songs traced the history of "Hey Joe", it's amazing how much it changed between Billy and Jimi. It also travelled all across the US before it got to him.
</li><li> "Hi Ho Silver Lining" was not originally by Jeff Beck. It was first recorded by The Attack, but the song is often attributed to Beck because his version charted first.
</li><li> "Highwayman" was first recorded by its writer, Jimmy Webb. Glen Campbell also recorded it before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGroup">The Highwaymen</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WaylonJennings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WaylonJennings">Waylon Jennings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>, and Kris Kristofferson) did.
</li><li> "Hijo de la Luna" was originally recorded by the Spanish band Mecano. In Germany, however, it's pretty much only known as a pseudo-Christmas song by the Dutch singer Loona.
</li><li> Dwight Yoakam's "Honky Tonk Man" seems to be more well known than Johnny Horton's original; for some reason, most of Johnny's non-historically-themed songs (e.g. "Sink the Bismarck", "North to Alaska", "Battle of New Orleans") seem to be long forgotten.
</li><li> Most people are more familiar with the Blue Swede version of "Hooked on a Feeling"&mdash;you know, the one with the "ooga chaka"s&mdash;than the earlier performance by B.J. Thomas. It was made even more well-known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby">"Dancing Baby"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> song, featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal">Ally McBeal</a></em>. Blue Swede itself borrowed "ooga chaka" from an earlier version by Jonathan King. Averted with Blue Swede's other hit, "Never My Love," still mostly "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">associated</a>" with The Association.
</li><li> If you type "Hot Cherie" in the search box for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google">Google</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, you will inevitably find the Hardline song first. This was a cover of a song by Streetheart. The song was covered by Danny Spanos as well, which is also more popular than Streetheart's version, but still not as popular as Hardline's.
</li><li> When "Hot Rod Lincoln" is mentioned, most probably think of the best-selling version by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, rather than the original by Charlie Ryan and the Livingston Brothers or the first hit remake by Johnny Bond. Somewhere, four cylinders pulling the titular Model A were lost, in the process of covering by various artists.
</li><li> "Hound Dog" was <em>not</em> originally done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>; it was originally written for and performed by a singer named Big Mama Thornton. This got a reference in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hounddog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hounddog">Hounddog</a></em>, where the main character, an Elvis fanatic during his heyday in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, is disheartened to find out that her favorite singer didn't record the titular song first.
</li><li> "House of the Rising Sun" was <em>not</em> written by The Animals. It's a folk song from the United States, and the oldest known recording was made in 1933. And in the original version, the singer is female. Some people thought that it was a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>, whose own version was recorded only 2 years earlier.
</li><li> <em>"How Am I Supposed To Live Without You"</em>, from 1989, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBolton">Michael Bolton</a>'s most well-known songs, was a cover of the 1983 Laura Branigan song of the same name. It should be noted however that Bolton actually co-wrote the song and, in fact, had originally offered it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AirSupply" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AirSupply">Air Supply</a>, only to offer it to Branigan instead when Clive Davis, president of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AristaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AristaRecords">Arista Records</a>, Air Supply's record label, demanded that Bolton make lyrical changes before giving it to the band.
</li><li> "How Do I Live" is a weird case. When it was first written for the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir">Con Air</a></em>, composer Diane Warren initially gave it to LeAnn Rimes (15 at the time) and her version was poised to be the soundtrack's lead single. But the filmmakers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">insisted that Rimes was "too poppy" to sell a song about heartbreak</a>, and they had the song rerecorded with another country singer, Trisha Yearwood (whose version was featured in the movie), while the song's creative team rushed Rimes' version to radio. Both versions became hits at the same time, however Yearwood's version was eventually withdrawn from radio after about a year because the execs thought it would eat her album sales. Rimes' version, however, remains one of her biggest hits, with one of the longest chart runs in music history.
</li><li> When people think of the song "How Soon Is Now?", they're more likely nowadays to think of the theme song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, which was performed by Love Spit Love. The original version is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a>, originally released as a B-side to their 1984 single "William, It Was Really Nothing" and later featured on their compilation album <em>Hatful of Hollow</em> and on US, Canadian, Australian, and Warner UK editions of the group's second album <em>Meat Is Murder</em>. Love Spit Love's cover was recorded specifically for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>. Nowadays, while <em>Charmed</em> is still a classic, "How Soon Is Now?" Is now best remembered as by the Smiths.
</li><li> "Hurdy Gurdy Man": while most of the people who know this song are aware that it was first written and performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan">Donovan</a> (Leitch), Steve Hillage's cover version has reached a larger audience and enjoyed a greater popularity since the mid-70s.
</li><li> Many fans of the early goth band Alien Sex Fiend will rave about how great the song "Hurricane Fighter Plane" is, unaware that it's a cover of a song by Red Krayola, a 60s psychedelic band.
</li><li> Younger audiences are often more familiar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>'s version of "Hurt," released in 2002, than the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a> song released in 1994, though the Nine Inch Nails song still receives frequent radio play. Because of Cash's long career, some journalists also assume that Cash's version is much older than it really is, and that the Nine Inch Nails version is the cover. In spite of a longstanding urban legend, Trent Reznor never disowned his original song in favor of Cash's version. In reality, he only said that Cash's cover version was distinct enough from the original to stand on its own as a new song.
<div class="indent"> "NIN closed the night with a slow and smoky cover of Johnny Cash's 'Hurt,' which earned nonstop cheers from the crowd." &mdash;<em>Associated Press</em>
</div></li><li> "Hush", written by Joe South and first recorded by Billy Joe Royal, is probably most famous as covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a> (1968) or by Kula Shaker (1997).
</li><li> "Hide Your Heart" is a complex example. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> version is the best-known, and it was in fact co-written by Paul Stanley. However, the KISS version came out a year after the original recording by Bonnie Tyler. The KISS version also came out the same month as a version by former KISS member Ace Frehley, one month before a version by southern rock band Molly Hatchet, and the same year as a version by Bonnie Tyler-esque rock diva Robin Beck.

<ul><li> The Soviet song "I Am Glad, 'Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home" is best known as the "Trololo song" thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">now famous</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM">YouTube video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of singer Eduard Khil performing a non-lexical vocable version of the song. Good luck finding the original version with the actual lyrics.
</li><li> Gloria Gaynor's famous disco number "I Am What I Am" is so popular that most people forget that it was originally from the Broadway musical about gay pride called <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaCageAuxFolles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaCageAuxFolles">La Cage Aux Folles</a></em>. Leading to a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> from people complaining about "How the gays stole this song for their pride parades".
</li><li> Chris Cagle's biggest hit, "I Breathe In, I Breathe Out", is a cover of a song first recorded by David Kersh.
</li><li> The original version of "I Can't Stand The Rain" is not Seal's from 2008. Nor Tina Turner's from 1985. Nor did Tina cover Eruption's 1978 disco version. It's the one recorded by Ann Peebles in 1973.
</li><li> Written by Diane Warren, Edwin McCain's version of "I Could Not Ask For More" released in 1999 to significant radio play, but it has been almost completely forgotten in the wake of the country cover, released the very next year, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraEvans">Sara Evans</a>. She even took the song to a higher position on the Billboard Hot 100 than he did, and McCain is today remembered pretty much only for his first hit "I'll Be."

(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealMusicVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrealMusicVideo">Not that Cherrelle's version isn't memorable, either.</a>)
</li><li> "Ievan Polkka" is mix of Covered Up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. The song was written in the 1930's by Eino Kettunen, and performed many times since then, but most non-Finnish internet users were introduced to the song by Loituma's a cappella cover version&mdash;specifically, the 27-second portion of the song used in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.leekspin.com/">Leekspin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> flash video. The kicker is that this clip was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScatSinging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScatSinging">Scat Singing</a> intermezzo that Loituma added. Naturally, several cover versions since (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HatsuneMiku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HatsuneMiku">Hatsune Miku</a>'s version, the Holly Dolly version, and one Russian cover) have copied Loituma's improvised nonsense verbatim, more-or-less ignoring the real lyrics of the original song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a>'s version of "I Fought the Law". Even Bobby Fuller's 1964 version isn't the original. The song was written by Sonny Curtis, the same man who performed "Love Is All Around" from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", in 1959.
<ul><li> For younger listeners, it's likely to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeadKennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> cover they remember best. Or perhaps the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a> version, which closely followed the arrangement of The Clash.
</li></ul></li><li> "I Go Blind" by Hootie and the Blowfish is a cover of a song by 80's Canadian alternative rock group 54-40.
</li><li> Most people remember "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" as sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and later covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>. Fewer people remember the original hit by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles recorded it first, but their version wasn't released until 1998. The Isley Brothers fit in this song's history somewhere, too, between the Miracles and Gladys Knight. Norman Whitfield, the co-songwriter along with Barret Strong, loved to pass his songs around from artist to artist on the Motown roster.
</li><li> "I Hung My Head" is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> song, it's actually originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting">Sting</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>. It just happens that the Cash version is starting to have this effect.
</li><li> "I Just Want to Make Love to You" was covered by Foghat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>, and Etta James - any of whom may be believed to be the original artist - but was first recorded by Muddy Waters, in 1954.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett">Joan Jett</a>'s massive hit "I Love Rock And Roll" was originally by The Arrows.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' "I'm Free" is usually featured in commercials, movies and such through the version by The Soup Dragons.
</li><li> "I Like It", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">the lone single</a> of the Latin dance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supergroup">supergroup</a> The Blackout All-Stars and the theme song to the film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILikeItLikeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ILikeItLikeThat">I Like It Like That</a></em>, was not composed specifically for said film, but is a remake of the 1967 boogaloo song "I Like It Like That" by Pete Rodriguez. The BOAS version won further publicity from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">its use in a Burger King commercial</a>.
</li><li> "I Only Have Eyes for You" seems to be most remembered in a version done by the Flamingos in 1959, but it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber">Busby Berkeley Number</a> from the movie musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dames">Dames</a></em> (where it was sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickPowell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickPowell">Dick Powell</a>).
</li><li> "I Pray for You" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigAndRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigAndRich">Big &amp; Rich</a> is a curious example. Before this version, it was recorded on solo albums by Big &amp; Rich's members, Big Kenny and John Rich (Rich's version was even a single). However, neither version was commercially available until after Big &amp; Rich's version.
</li><li> "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" was sung in 1952 by Jimmy Boyd. It has been covered so many times that multiple versions have Covered Up the original, however it is most associated with The Jackson 5 and, to a lesser extent, John Mellencamp.
</li><li> Many people only know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Burnin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Burnin">"I Shot the Sheriff"</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a> recorded it. Nowadays, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">Marley's death at a young age</a>, both artists' versions of "Sheriff" are well-known.
</li><li> "I Think We're Alone Now" by Tommy James And The Shondells has been covered several times, most famously by Tiffany. Also, their song "Mony Mony" is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol">Billy Idol</a>'s now.
<ul><li> To add to the oddity, the two covers were #1 hits <em>consecutively</em>. Nowadays, "Mony" is the one more likely to be remembered as a James song than "Alone".
</li><li> And <em>then</em>, both covers were parodied on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EvenWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EvenWorse">Even Worse</a></em>, along with two other then-recent covers.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes">Diana Ross</a>'s 1984 song "It's Your Move", famous for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">Sampled Up</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vektroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vektroid">Macintosh Plus</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporwave">vaporwave</a> track "420/The Computing of Lisa Frank", is itself a cover of a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DougParkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DougParkinson">Doug Parkinson</a> song released a year earlier.
</li><li> Nowadays everyone thinks of "I Want Candy" as a Bow Wow Wow song, when in fact is was written two decades earlier by The Strangeloves &mdash; despite the fact that the original hit #11 while the cover only made it to #62.
</li><li> "I Want You to Want Me", originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Cheap Trick</a>, has been covered many times, but the one that probably qualifies for this the most would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DwightYoakam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DwightYoakam">Dwight Yoakam</a>'s country version, due to the genre change working so well that someone who heard Yoakam's version first would be hard-pressed to believe that it was a rock song first.
</li><li> While "I Will Always Love You" will be forever connected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a> as her greatest hit, it was first a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a> song. In fact, Dolly's version topped the country charts <em>twice</em>. To be fair, Dolly's version is obscure outside of said genre, especially outside the US where country music <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">isn't as popular</a>, even before Whitney's version was released.
<ul><li> Dolly herself, notably, doesn't mind the displacement. Unlike many of the other original artists featured on this list, she <em>wrote</em> the song and so made (and still makes) a great deal of money on the royalties that came with Whitney's megahit cover. Ironically, she would have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> much earlier when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> wanted to cover the song in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> - but his manager Colonel Tom Parker demanded 50% of the royalties, and Dolly refused.
</li><li> Dolly's not the only one Whitney displaced via <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBodyguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBodyguard">The Bodyguard</a></em> soundtrack: "I'm Every Woman" was originally a soul hit for Chaka Khan. In fact, it was Chaka's solo debut. That being said, it hasn't been displaced <em>quite</em> to the same extent, as Chaka's version still gets semi-regular airplay.
</li></ul></li><li> Josh Turner defied this with his cover of Don Williams' "I Wouldn't Be a Man". Nearly every piece of media related to the album went out of its way to mention that it was a cover. (However, most people are unaware that Billy Dean also put out a cover in 1997.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt">Mark Chesnutt</a>'s #1 hit "I'll Think of Something" was a top ten hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliamsJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliamsJr">Hank Williams Jr.</a>. in his earlier days (you know, before all the chest-beating "party" songs).
</li><li> "I'm Henery <em>[sic]</em> the Eighth, I Am" was not written by Herman's Hermits. It is significantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, having been penned in 1910 and first recorded by Harry Champion. The same applies with "Leaning On a Lamp Post" which was a North American hit for Herman's Hermits and was first recorded by British Music Hall legend George Formby in 1937 for the motion picture "Feather Your Nest."
</li><li> "I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover" is best known for being a #1 hit for Art Mooney and his orchestra in 1948 along with its prominence in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> shorts. The song was written in 1927 and had previously been recorded by Nick Lucas, Ben Bernie and Billy Murray.
</li><li> The hit version of "(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone" is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>, but the song was first recorded by Paul Revere And The Raiders. To be fair, both of those versions came out in the same year, The Monkees' version was just the one that became a hit. Punk fans are more likely to associate the song with either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSexPistols">The Sex Pistols</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MinorThreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MinorThreat">Minor Threat</a>. In fact, Ian MacKaye admitted that when Minor Threat started doing their version of the song, <em>they</em> thought it originated with The Sex Pistols.
<ul><li> Also, "I'm a Believer" by the Monkees was originally written (and recorded) by Neil Diamond, <em>then</em> it was covered by Smash Mouth.
</li></ul></li><li> If you asked people who sang "I'm Going Down," most people would probably say Mary J. Blige, not Rose Royce.
</li><li> You may recall "I've Told Every Little Star" in Linda Scott's 1961 hit version, especially if you're of a certain generation or have seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MulhollandDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MulhollandDrive">Mulholland Dr.</a></em>. This cover version is very different from its original use as the theme song of the Kern &amp; Hammerstein musical <em>Music in the Air</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>'s "Ice Cream Man" was first performed by blues musician John Brim.
</li><li> "If You Leave Me Now" (not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a> ballad), recorded in the late 90's by Stevie B. and Alexia Phillips (not to be confused with the Italian singer Alexia), was originally by a forgotten late 80's singer named Jaya. Ironically, Stevie B. also co-wrote and did the backup vocals in the original.
</li><li> Most people are familiar with "If You Asked Me To", written by veteran songwriter Diane Warren, as one of Celine Dion's first English-language hits. Few are aware that it was first recorded by Patti LaBelle, and even played over the end credits of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LicenceToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LicenceToKill">Licence to Kill</a></em>.
</li><li> It appears that "If You Knew Susie" was written for Al Jolson to sing in the Broadway musical <em>Big Boy</em>, but the song didn't go over well for him and the show. It then became one of the songs most associated with Eddie Cantor, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">popular rival</a>.
</li><li> Think of the song "Iko Iko". You're probably thinking either of the version used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Man</a></em>, the Dr. John version, or the Grateful Dead. Or Cyndi Lauper. Or maybe even the 1965 version recorded by The Dixie Cups which most people believe was "the original." They are all pre-dated by a 1953 recording by James "Sugar Boy" Crawford, who himself adapted a bunch of Mardi Gras parade chants into a song that he called "Jock-a-mo". The Dixie Cups' version came when the singers were on a break during recording and just started singing it&mdash;one band members' grandmother was a fan of the Crawford song&mdash;and didn't know that the producers were recording them.
</li><li> After hearing Vitas's performance of "Il Dulce Suono", a listener declared that she didn't like his rendition of the opera from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">The Fifth Element</a></em> and that you can't perform Sarah Brightman's music without screwing it up. (A common fan mistake: Brightman was not in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">The Fifth Element</a>.</em>) The music piece comes from the opera <em>Lucia de Lammermoor</em>, which debuted in 1835.
</li><li> "In A Sentimental Mood" was composed and recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DukeEllington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DukeEllington">Duke Ellington</a>, but it took Benny Goodman to score a hit with it.
</li><li> While everybody knows "In The Army Now" as one of the major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StatusQuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StatusQuo">Status Quo</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton">Sabaton</a>, who covered Status Quo's version) hits, very few people know it's a cover. The original version was sung in 1981 by the dutch duo Bolland and Bolland who, in mid-80s, became producers and worked with people as Falco or Samantha Fox.
</li><li> dc Talk's hit worship song "In The Light" from <em>Jesus Freak</em> was originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliePeacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliePeacock">Charlie Peacock</a>, who even provides guest vocals at the end of the more well-known version.
</li><li> Most people are familiar with "In The Street" as the theme song for <em>That 70's Show</em>. If they are aware it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune">Real Song Theme Tune</a> at all, it's likely because they noticed it being credited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Cheap Trick</a> in the end credits, or have their full version on a Cheap Trick greatest hits album or a <em>That 70's Show</em> companion album. In fact it was first performed by cult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigStar">Big Star</a> in 1972, two years before Cheap Trick formed. Because Cheap Trick are the more well known of the two Seventies bands, people tend to assume it's an early Cheap Trick song, when in fact their cover was specifically recorded for the show.
</li><li> "It Ain't What You Do (It's The Way That You Do It)" is an old jazz number first done by Jimmie Lunceford in 1939 and later by the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EllaFitzgerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EllaFitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> (usually under the title "'Tain't What You Do..."), but most people today only know the version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFunBoyThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFunBoyThree">The Fun Boy Three</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bananarama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bananarama">Bananarama</a>.
</li><li> Madness' "It Must Be Love" is a cover of a Labi Siffre song recorded ten years previously. Interestingly, he makes a cameo in the music video for the Madness version. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness">Madness</a>' "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneStepBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneStepBeyond">One Step Beyond</a>" is also a cover, Prince Buster did it first.
</li><li> A different "It Must Be Love" was a hit for Alan Jackson in 2000, but first it was a hit for Don Williams in 1979.
</li><li> "It's A Fine Day" may have been made famous by Opus III, but they weren't the first to record it. It was written by Edward Barton, and sung a cappella by his girlfriend Jane Lancaster. In a bizarre twist, a remix of Jane's version by ATB was released six years after Opus III's cover.
</li><li> People who went to house music clubs circa 1987 may remember Sterling Void's original version of "It's Alright", but more people know it from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a> cover.

<ul><li> Which itself was a cover of the Austrian song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslatedCoverVersion">"Und jetzt ist es still"</a>, performed by Horst Winter in 1948, written by Austrian composer Hans Lang and Erich Meder.
</li></ul></li><li> "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" is one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoyzIIMen">Boyz II Men</a>'s signature tunes. Few of the group's fans would know of the 1975 original by G.C. Cameron. And nearly all of <em>them</em> only because of the song's presence on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CooleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CooleyHigh">Cooley High</a></em> soundtrack.
</li><li> "It's Not Funny Anymore", originally by H&uuml;sker D&uuml;, was covered by Lifetime on their "Hello Bastards" record. Since the song is prominently in the middle of the record, and fits in so well that it's a cover is usually completely unknown to anyone who hadn't heard the H&uuml;sker D&uuml; original, which is quite a few as it's one of their more obscurish tracks from a rather ignored era. (Not to mention that "Hello Bastards" is today considered a melodic punk classic while H&uuml;sker D&uuml;'s "Metal Circus" was greatly eclipsed by their later works.)
</li><li> "It's In Every One Of Us" was originally written and recorded by David Pomeranz in 1975, but it never truly took off until it appeared on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnDenver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnDenver">John Denver</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a>' <em>A Christmas Together</em> album four years later. It's since been covered by Clay Aiken, Dayna Manning, Dennis DeYoung, and the cast of the TV edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fame">Fame</a></em>, among others; it was also featured in the musical <em>Time</em> (for which Pomeranz is credited for contributing additional music in the otherwise Dave Clark Five-composed score), and an instrumental version appeared on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Big" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Big">Big</a></em> soundtrack.

</li><li> "I've Done Everything For You", covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickSpringfield">Rick Springfield</a> in 1982, was written by a pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SammyHagar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SammyHagar">Sammy Hagar</a> in 1980.
</li><li> "J'attendrai" ("I'll Wait"), the song made popular by Rina Ketty during <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTeo">World War Teo</a>, was originally an Italian song titled "Tornerai" ("You'll Return").
</li><li> "Jesus Doesn't Want me For A Sunbeam" is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> original. It was originally done by Scottish group The Vaselines, who made more money from Nirvana's cover than from all of their own records put together.
</li><li> "Jesus Is Just Alright", first recorded in 1966 by black gospel group The Art Reynolds Singers, was covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a> on their 1969 album <em>Ballad of Easy Rider</em>, and then even more successfully by the Doobie Brothers on their 1972 album <em>Toulouse Street</em>.
</li><li> "Jet Airliner" was written and preformed by Paul Pena, but the album was shelved by his record label and only released 27 years later, in 2000. Steve Miller heard a bootleg of the song and recorded a cover with the Steve Miller Band, which became a massive hit.
</li><li> "Johnny", popularized by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gilla">Gilla</a>, is originally a song in Italian titled "Uomo", written by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TotoCutugno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TotoCutugno">Toto Cutugno</a> and performed by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitaMedici" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitaMedici">Mita Medici</a>.
</li><li> "Joining a Fan Club", an album track from Jellyfish's <em>Spilt Milk</em> album, was later covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JPop">J-Pop</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuffyAmiYumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuffyAmiYumi">Puffy AmiYumi</a>. Interestingly enough, Jellyfish's vocalist/drummer Andy Sturmer is one of Puffy AmiYumi's producers and writers.
</li><li> Brian Setzer's hit "Jump Jive an' Wail" was a cover of a 1957 song by Louis Prima.
<ul><li> About half the songs by the Brian Setzer Orchestra are covers, which is to be expected when your <em>genre</em> is a "revival" of a style that was popular 50 years ago.
</li></ul></li><li> Danielle Brisebois co-wrote and performed "Just Missed The Train" for her 1994 debut album, but the song is usually associated with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> winner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>.
</li><li> "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" is best known for being in <em>The Big Lewbowski</em> as a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WUTlCTi7fg">Kenny Rogers song (during his time as leader of the First Edition)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but it was actually written by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3m3ruEx15A">Mickey Newbury<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> "Just Got Paid" is better known by the younger generations from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">*NSYNC</a>'s version, but Johnny Kemp did it first in 1988.
</li><li> "Just One Person" was written for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> stage adaptation, <em>Snoopy!</em>. However, it is now completely associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a> considering it was used as the eulogy song for him both at his funeral and the television tribute to him which declared that the genius' legacy would continue.
</li><li> Roberta Flack's cover might be the most famous version of "Killing Me Softly" for those who knew it before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees">The Fugees</a> covered it (and subsequently featured it on their album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheScore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheScore">The Score</a></em>), but it was first performed by Lori Lieberman.
</li><li> "Knock On Wood" by Eddie Floyd, better known from the Amii Stewart version (and later, Mary Griffin's version on the <em>Studio 54</em> soundtrack). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">And no, Donna Summer never sang it.</a>
</li><li> The Russian folk song "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korobeiniki">Korobeiniki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" is now best known as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> theme.
</li><li> "La Bamba", made famous by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens">Ritchie Valens</a>, was originally a Mexican (more precisely, Veracruz) wedding dance song, and its first extant recording (by "El Jarocho" - Alvaro Hern&aacute;ndez Ortiz) predates Valens' by almost 20 years. The video of the Los Lobos cover of "La Bamba" (which they in turn did for the soundtrack to the Ritchie Valens bio-pic) ends with the band starting to play the traditional song on acoustic guitars. It's kinda nifty.
</li><li> The version of "Lady Marmalade" recorded for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoulinRouge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoulinRouge">Moulin Rouge!</a></em> definitely fits. It wasn't even done by LaBelle first; that honor goes to the Eleventh Hour.
</li><li> "Lambada", the worldwide hit by Kaoma, is an unauthorized cover of the song "Llorando se Fue" by a Bolivian band named Los Kjarkas, who successfully sued Kaoma for copyright infringement. It was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">Sampled Up</a> in Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez's "On the Floor". It also serves as a cover up of the whole Brazilian dance of lambada, which predates the song, whoever its performer.
</li><li> An odd example: The best remembered version of "Land of 1,000 Dances" is neither the first version (by Chris Kenner) nor the highest charting version (by Wilson Pickett), but a low-charting version by the otherwise obscure band Cannibal and the Headhunters &mdash; which was, significantly, the first version to use the "na-na-na-na" chorus.
</li><li> "Landslide", written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks">Stevie Nicks</a> and first performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>, is often thought by younger listeners as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks">Dixie Chicks</a> song.
</li><li> "Last Christmas" has been covered so many times by so many artists it would probably be better off listed as a "traditional" song. Its original artists were Wham!, who had a <em>huge</em> hit with it in the UK in 1984. Nowadays it's more common for people to think of it as being from a female POV, despite the original being sung by a man.
</li><li> "Last Kiss" was first recorded in 1962 by its author, Wayne Cochran. The first hit version was released in 1964 by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PearlJam">Pearl Jam</a> covered it after Eddie Vedder found a copy of the 45 single at a flea market. Although, really, is it not obvious that it's a 60's song? Particularly since it's very much in the "Dead Teenage Lover" genre that was so popular at the time.
</li><li> "The Last Saskatchewan Pirate" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheArrogantWorms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheArrogantWorms">The Arrogant Worms</a> is pretty well-known in Canada (and pretty much anthemic in Saskatchewan), but the rock cover by Captain Tractor (i.e. the one with the flute solo) is the one most people think of. The Worms are better known overall, leading many to mistake the cover version for their own.
</li><li> "Leaving on a Jet Plane" was written and performed by John Denver, but it didn't become famous until it was covered by Peter, Paul and Mary; Chantal Kreviazuk also recorded a modestly popular version (featured on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon">Armageddon</a></em> soundtrack). Most people also probably want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">avoid associating</a> John Denver with planes...
</li><li> When Chris Montez had a #4 hit with "Let's Dance" in 1962, nobody knew that a year earlier, Tony Sheridan (the singer most famous for performing a rock 'n' roll version of "My Bonnie" with none other than The Beatles) recorded and even co-wrote it! But his version wasn't released to the public until 1967, and he only gets writing credit on the album <em>In The Beginning</em> with his Beatles recordings.
</li><li> "A Lesson in Leavin'," a 1999 country smash by Jo Dee Messina (which famously was held out of the No. 1 spot for seven weeks by the even more popular "Amazed" by Lonestar, before falling to No. 3 the same week "Amazed" fell from No. 1) was a No. 1 country hit by Dottie West in 1980. Except for oldies stations, West's version is forgotten.
</li><li> Many people know "Life is a Highway" best as a song sung by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts">Rascal Flatts</a></em> for the 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars">Cars</a></em>. It was originally sung by Tom Cochrane in 1991.
</li><li> For a long time, "Little Boxes" was thought of by many people as a Pete Seeger song, until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds">Weeds</a></em> brought Malvina Reynolds' original back into the public eye.
</li><li> "Little Bit O' Soul" was originally recorded in 1965 by an obscure Birmingham, UK band called the Little Darlings. Two years later American garage-rockers the Music Explosion covered it and took it all the way to #2 on the <em>Billboard</em> chart.
</li><li> "Little Darlin'" was introduced by the Gladiolas and barely cracked the top 100. A month later, a Canadian group known as The Diamonds recorded the definitive version, riding it up to No. 2 on the charts for eight weeks and making it a doo-wop classic.
</li><li> "Little Suzi" by Tesla was originally titled "Little Suzi's On The Up"; first written and recorded by PhD in 1982. This troper only became aware of that fact with the passing of co-writer (and singer on the PhD original) Jim Diamond.
</li><li> Kris Allen neither wrote nor originally recorded "Live like we're Dying". That was The Script.
</li><li> For Eurobeat fans, "Livin' in the Night" by Pamsy, which predates Cascada's version of "Everytime We Touch", uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong">Suspiciously Similar Song</a> variant of the original melody, as well as using elements of Trinity's version.
</li><li> "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" was released by an obscure country singer named Bob Luman in 1972, (best remembered for "Let's Think About Livin'" in 1960), and later covered up by Steve Wariner in 1983. In an odd aversion of this trope, both Luman's original and Wariner's cover went to #4 on the country charts.
</li><li> Bananarama's "Look on The Floor" covers the chorus of the 80's italo-disco song "Hypnotic Tango" by My Mine.
</li><li> "Lotta Love" was originally written and performed by Neil Young. Young's backup singer Nicolette Larson turned it into a huge hit.
</li><li> "Louie Louie" was not written by the Kingsmen. Nor was it improved or rescued from obscurity by them. It was written and recorded in 1956 by Rick Berry and the Pharaohs, and was very popular in the rock and roll community around Seattle and Tacoma (and in those communities, the Kingsmen's version wasn't even the most popular - it was the one by the soon-to-be-famous Paul Revere and the Raiders). All the Kingsmen did was to make it visible to the white youth market across the US, and slur the vocals so much that the lyrics could not be understood, making it sound naughty and subversive.
<ul><li> The slurring was unintentional: They recorded the song using one microphone <em>mounted on the ceiling</em>, Jack Ely's voice was shot from taking part in an all-night Louie-Louieathon (and he was wearing braces at the time) and, while aware that they had to record in one take, the band didn't know that the tape was running and thought they were doing a rehearsal play through. The FBI actually investigated the "obscene" lyrics with the aid of analysts and linguists and, after 18 months, declared it "unintelligible at any speed", proving themselves <em>unable to determine the authorship of a published song!</em> And while they questioned a number of people in the course of the investigation, for some reason Jack Ely was never brought in and asked to repeat what he had sung. (Nor, apparently, did they notice the <em>actual</em> profanity that a member of the band shouts after missing a cue 53 seconds in.)
</li><li> More than likely because The Kingsmen were reluctant to admit that they'd forced Ely to quit the band, but were still using his vocals anyway during "live" performances.
</li><li> In, ah, certain circles, the tune is much more famous in the form of "Pharaoh, Pharaoh, whooooa baby, let my people go ..." Many churchgoing children are surprised to first hear "Louie, Louie."
</li><li> Which is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">ironic</a> considering who wrote it.
</li></ul></li><li> Nirvana's song "Love Buzz" (from their album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>) is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlipped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlipped">Gender Flipped</a> cover version of a 1969 song by Dutch psychedelic band <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShockingBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShockingBlue">Shocking Blue</a> (released on <em>their</em> album <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtHome">At Home</a></em>) whose other hit, "Venus," was covered up by Bananarama.
</li><li> "Love Has Fallen Down on Me", originally by Rotary Connection, made famous by Chaka Khan (and that version itself made famous by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentySevenDresses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentySevenDresses">27 Dresses</a></em>), using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">a note-for-note rearrangement of the original</a> by Charles Stepney.
</li><li> Remember the song "Love Hurts" by Nazareth? How about the original version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEverlyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEverlyBrothers">The Everly Brothers</a>, or the subsequent cover by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a> which also predated Nazareth's? Or the Gram Parsons/Emmylou Harris duet? Didn't think so.
</li><li> Phil Vassar's "Love Is a Beautiful Thing" was previously a single for Paul Brandt under the title "It's a Beautiful Thing."
</li><li> "Love Like This", a 1995 single by Carlene Carter, was originally recorded by Kennedy Rose in 1989, and by Blackhawk in 1994.
</li><li> In a rare case of the instrumental cover overshadowing the original vocal song, Paul Mauriat's rendition of "L'amour est bleu" ("Love Is Blue", composed by Andr&eacute; Popp and performed by Vicky Leandros) was the only French hit to top the American Billboard Hot 100 until 2017; its predecessor, despite taking 4th place at Eurovision Song Contest of 1967, failed to take ground in the US. Nowadays, even in Europe Mauriat's version is arguably more well-known than the original.
</li><li> Whitney Houston's "Love is Like A Butterfly" which many Brits will know from the 1970's programme <em>Butterflies</em> - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune">which used as its theme tune</a> the original version by Dolly Parton.
</li><li> "Love You Down", from INOJ album <em>Ready For The World</em>, was originally by... the band Ready For The World.
</li><li> Jerrod Niemann's "Lover, Lover" is probably the first time that most Americans have heard this song. Australians, however, probably know it better through Sonia Dada's original, which was titled "You Don't Treat Me No Good." The strange thing here is that Sonia Dada was an <em>American</em> band!
</li><li> Canadian example: It's almost certain that more people know the Barenaked Ladies' softer version of "Lovers in a Dangerous Time" rather than the original, performed by Bruce Cockburn. Ironically, the song was first released in an album called <em>Kick at the Darkness</em>, a <em>Bruce Cockburn tribute album</em>.
</li><li> In the US, <em>La Vie en Rose</em> is usually associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdithPiaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdithPiaf">&Eacute;dith Piaf</a>.

<ul><li> "MacArthur Park" is either known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">the song the Jurassic Park parody was based on</a> or a cheesy disco hit from Donna Summer. In fact, it was written by Jimmy Webb and first recorded by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Richard Harris aka Dumbledore.</a>
<ul><li> Harris's version is still fairly well remembered, however. It's usually one of the first songs mentioned whenever the topic of musical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> is discussed. Made better by the fact that, when asked what it was about, he basically said that he had no idea and in fact didn't care, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">since it was just a job to him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Gary Jules version of "Mad World" (made for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em> soundtrack, used in a commercial for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> and part of the in-game soundtrack for Gears Of War 3) is much more well-known than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears">Tears for Fears</a> original.
</li><li> "Mah Na Mah Na" was first heard in an Italian soft-core porn film titled "Sweden, Heaven And Hell", performed by a band called Marc 4 (actually session musicians from the Italian public service broadaster's orcherstra) under the title "Hooray for the Swedish Sauna". It gained fame when it was performed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> and especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>. Arguably, the later <em>Muppet Show</em> version covered up the <em>Sesame Street</em> version of the skit, which was also performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a>, but as a canonically separate character (Bip Bippadotta rather than Mahna Mahna).
</li><li> "Making Memories of Us" was written by Rodney Crowell and originally recorded by Tracy Byrd in 2003. Crowell himself cut it as part of his side project The Notorious Cherry Bombs in 2004, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban">Keith Urban</a> had the biggest hit version of it a year later.
</li><li> Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson's duet "Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys" was a minor hit for its writer, Ed Bruce, three years before the Waylon/Willie version.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a> did "Mama Told Me Not to Come" before Three Dog Night (and way before the Tom Jones and Stereophonics version). Newman wasn't the first to perform it either, as he wrote it for Eric Burdon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAnimals">The Animals</a>, though comparatively speaking the Animals' version is rather obscure.
</li><li> Judging by the name, you'd probably suspect that Lou Bega's "Mambo No. 5" is something like a cover, but unless you're interested in mambo in general, you'll hardly know that the instrumental was composed by P&eacute;rez Prado, King of the Mambo.
</li><li> Barry Manilow's "Mandy" was originally called "Brandy", and it was written and performed in 1971 by Scott English and Richard Kerr. The title change was to avoid confusion with "Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)", an unrelated song by Looking Glass that was a hit around the same time.
</li><li> David Grant and Jaki Graham had a UK top 10 hit with the soul ballad &#147;Mated&#148; in 1986. It was written and originally performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> and his band Utopia.
</li><li> Lil' Suzy's "Memories" was by the Eurodance group Netzwerk. Scott Brown also did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedyTechnoRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedyTechnoRemake">happy hardcore remix</a> of the original artist's version.
</li><li> "Memphis" by Johnny Rivers is an interesting example in that it covers the original song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry">Chuck Berry</a> while incorporating the guitar work and solo from an existing instrumental cover by Lonnie Mack.
</li><li> Toni Basil's song "Mickey" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flipped</a> cover of the song "Kitty" by the obscure British band Racey. Because the song is about feeling sexual desire for someone who won't put out, the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">takes on a different meaning</a> when the genders are reversed. Particularly the line "Any time you want to do it, I'll take it like a man," which became "Any way you want to do it, I'll take it like a man."
</li><li> Iconic surfer song "Misirlou" has its origins in folk dance; Dick Dale had learned it from his uncle, a Lebanese folk musician, and adapted his version, at greatly-increased tempo from the original, on a bet that he could play an entire song on a single guitar string. The first extant recording of the song dates back to <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">1927</a></strong>, as performed by Michalis Patrinos (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misirlou">cite The Other Wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) as a Greek rebetiko song. True authorship is unknown, as is the case with most rebetiko songs. Nowadays, credit is given to either Patrinos or Nicholas Roubanis (who created a jazz arrangement in 1941), and S. Russell, N. Wise and M. Leeds who wrote lyrics. It's also been covered in various other styles, including Klezmer. And now, of course, a lot of people think of it as "The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em> Theme". It was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">Sampled Up</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas">The Black Eyed Peas</a> in "Pump It".
</li><li> "Mister Sandman" is usually associated with The Chordettes (who had the most popular version) or with The Four Aces (whose version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSandmanSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSandmanSequence">features</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>), with the former usually thought to have recorded it first. Vaughn Monroe was actually the first to record it. To be fair, his version was stuck on a B-side and the arrangement, while quite pleasant, is rather forgettable compared to the Chordettes' creative knee-slapping arrangement.
</li><li> "Mona Lisa", best known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NatKingCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NatKingCole">Nat King Cole</a> hit, was originally written for the forgettable (and forgotten) 1950 movie, <em>Captain Carey, USA</em>. Ironically, it was never sung or played all the way through in the movie.
</li><li> Many more people are familiar with Cyndi Lauper's cover of "Money Changes Everything" than the original by The Brains.
</li><li> "Money's Too Tight To Mention", a minor hit for the Valentine Brothers, is better-known as a major hit (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> candidate) for Simply Red.
</li><li> The original theme for <em>Bishoujo Senshi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, "Moonlight Densetsu," is a cover of "Sayonara ha Dance no Ato ni" from the '60s. The second theme avoided this trope by being written by Naoko Takeuchi herself.
</li><li> Cat Stevens covered "Morning Has Broken" which had English lyrics added to it by Eleanor Farjeon from a much older song (see most modern hymnals).
</li><li> "Move It On Over" was written and recorded by Hank Williams Sr. before being covered in the 70's by George Thorogood.
</li><li> "Mr. Bojangles", originally by Jerry Jeff Walker, became a massive hit for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
</li><li> "My Island Home" was not originally by Torres Strait Islander Christine Anu, but by Warupmi Band, an Aboriginal group from the Northern Territory, penned by member Neil Murray. Anu started out as their backing singer, and was encouraged by Murray to sing it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>'s version of "My Maria" is seemingly much more well-known than B.W. Stevenson's original. Even worse, Stevenson was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a>.
<ul><li> It wasn't the first time it happened to B.W. Stevenson either. Just as his version of "Shambala" started gaining momentum, Three Dog Night released theirs and had a Top 10 hit with it.
</li></ul></li><li> "My Way" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> is the cover of "Comme d'Habitude" (As Usual) by French singer Claude Fran&ccedil;ois althought the English lyrics (written by Paul Anka, who would also record it later) are completely different.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wu3n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3wu3n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wu3n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The original is about a married man falling out of love but trying to keep up appearances.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksonFive">The Jackson 5</a> had a big US hit with "Never Can Say Goodbye" in 1971. Most other places, the song is more famous as the 1974 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a> for Gloria Gaynor.
</li><li> "New York City" was a song written and performed by an obscure indie band from Vancouver named "cub" in 1995. Of course, if you heard the 1996 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheyMightBeGiants">They Might Be Giants</a> new wave version of the song first, you would likely not even know that it was a cover.
</li><li> "New York Groove", a song written by Russ Ballard and originally recorded by UK glam rock band Hello in 1975, was Covered Up three years later by Ace Frehley on his solo album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> Covered Up "New York, New York," which was written by Kander and Ebb for Liza Minnelli as the theme song of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewYorkNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NewYorkNewYork">movie of the same name</a>. Lampshaded by Liza's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> character Lucille Ostero when Tobias starts singing the song.
</li><li> "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", originally recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand">The Band</a> in 1969, became the sole Top 10 hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanBaez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanBaez">Joan Baez</a> two years later. Somewhat inverted, however, in that you're far more likely to hear the original these days. And Baez's version contains a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">Mondegreen</a> as well.
</li><li> Country music singer Kevin Sharp's only #1 hit was "Nobody Knows", by Tony Rich. While Rich's was his only big hit, Kevin at least got two more Top 5 country hits after his somewhat more well-known cover.
</li><li> "No More I Love You's", by an obscure 80s band The Lover Speaks, didn't become famous until it was covered by Annie Lennox.
</li><li> "Not Fade Away" was originally performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>, but it's far better known from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGratefulDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheGratefulDead">The Grateful Dead</a>. It was also covered by Steve Hillage as "Not Fade Away (Glide Forever)" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, and was the debut single of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> in 1963.
</li><li> "Nothing Compares 2 U", as made famous by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SineadOConnor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SineadOConnor">Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor</a>, was originally written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a> for his band "The Family". According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleJohnsBathroomReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleJohnsBathroomReader">Uncle John's Bathroom Reader</a></em>, Prince was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">planning to remake the original version with a female singer</a> before O'Connor released her version, which became one of the biggest hits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.
</li><li> "Not In Love" was originally performed by 80's new wave band Platinum Blonde. A 2010 cover by indie electronic band Crystal Castles featuring Robert Smith of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a> on vocals proved to be a sizable hit on American alternative radio.
</li><li> "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" has been around the block. It was first released in 1952 by Hank Snow, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s 1959 cover was a big pop hit in the US and UK. And on top of that, there's another cover by Baillie &amp; the Boys in 1990 that got almost as high on the country charts as did Hank Snow's version.
</li><li> The most famous version of "Now That We Found Love" is the 1991 hit by Heavy D and the Boyz. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> the 1978 version by the reggae band Third World. However, Third World didn't record the original; the O'Jays did, five years earlier.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://nyan.cat/">"Nyan Cat"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> song, known officially as "Nyanyanyanya". The most popular version of it is sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UTAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UTAU">Momo Momone</a>. But how many people known that the original version was sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikuHatsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikuHatsune">Miku Hatsune</a>?
</li><li> "O Death" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Also known as</a> "Oh Death", amongst other names) is an American folk song from the early 20th century. People know of it from a variety of covers. Nowadays it is associated with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntilDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntilDawn">Until Dawn</a></em>.
</li><li> "Obsession" was first performed not by Animotion, but by Michael Des Barres and Holly Knight. Animotion's was the first to appear on the charts.
</li><li> "Ode to Billie Joe" by Bobbie Gentry had originally been released by Margie Singleton, whose version was climbing the charts when Bobbie's was released.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2BvzGANTyQ">"Off to War"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAkaneia">Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem</a></em>, ended up getting something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">Colbert Bump</a> by its use as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIul0YaKnNs">the boss theme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rockman4MinusInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rockman4MinusInfinity">Rockman 4 Minus Infinity</a></em>.

</div></li><li> On classic rock radio, the recording of "Oh Well" from the 1980 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a> album <em>Live</em>, with Lindsay Buckingham singing, is the definitive version of the song. One would hardly be aware that the original recording dates to 1969, was sung by Peter Green, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking">includes a 6-minute acoustic instrumental outro</a> that rivals <em>Layla</em> in its awesomeness.
</li><li> Blake Shelton's signature song "Ol' Red" was first recorded by George Jones, and had been covered by Kenny Rogers before Blake got to it.
</li><li> "Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You" is one of the rare variants where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a> cover is the better known. Joe Sun cut the original. (Interestingly, it was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha">Kesha</a>'s mother well before Kesha was born.)
</li><li> In an odd subversion, Edyta Gorniak was the original artist of "One and One" although the Robert Miles/Maria Nayler version was released first.
</li><li> "One Day at a Time". Originally recorded by Marilyn Sellars, whose version was a #19 country and #37 pop hit in 1974. In 1977, a version by an Irish singer named Gloria went to #1 in her native country; two years later, Lena Martell had a #1 with it in the UK. Country music audiences probably know it best through Cristy Lane's 1980 cover, which went to #1 on the country charts.
</li><li> "One (Is The Loneliest Number)" was made famous by Three Dog Night, but was written and first recorded by Harry Nilsson. Aimee Mann's later cover for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Magnolia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Magnolia">Magnolia</a></em> soundtrack is notable for hewing much closer to Nilsson's arrangement of the song than the Three Dog Night version.
<ul><li> Three Dog Night had a penchant for recording definitive versions of other people's songs.
</li></ul></li><li> "One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer", a well-known George Thorogood song, was written by Rudy Toombs for Amos Milburn, but first recorded by John Lee Hooker. The George Thorogood version actually combines this song with another John Lee Hooker song, "House Rent Boogie".
</li><li> "One Shining Moment", the song used at the very end of the NCAA Men's College Basketball Championship game, was originally recorded by songwriter David Barrett in 1987. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LutherVandross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LutherVandross">Luther Vandross</a>' version (in use since 2003) has become so iconic that replacing the Vandross version (as CBS did with Jennifer Hudson's cover in 2010) proved to be a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for college basketball fans.
</li><li> "One Tin Soldier" was first recorded by The Original Caste, not Coven.
</li><li> Most people seem to associate the song "Only Hope" with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AWalkToRemember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AWalkToRemember">A Walk to Remember</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MandyMoore">Mandy Moore</a> sings it, and some even credit her as writing it. Even those who notice that the song was written by a guy named Jonathan Foreman generally don't know that Jon Foreman is the lead singer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Switchfoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Switchfoot">Switchfoot</a>, the band which first performed the song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a>'s "Over the Hills and Far Away", not to be confused with the 18th century or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> ones, is a cover of an earlier one by Gary Moore.
</li><li> Some may be surprised to learn that "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" was not written by Hawaiian singer Iz (which, if you haven't heard the cover, you've likely heard a cover of the cover, as it is a very easy and popular song beginners on the ukulele to learn). It was actually written for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>. The same may occur with his mashup of "Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World'', although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> version is iconic enough to avert this.
</li><li> "Pancho and Lefty" was a '70s signature song for cult folk singer Townes Van Zandt; however it's best known for being the title track to a 1983 collaborative album by Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, the number one country album for most of that year.
</li><li> Everyone knows the Temptations' "Papa Was a Rolling Stone". The group's singer Dennis Edwards even got angry at songwriter Norman Whitfield because the song opens "It was the 3rd of September [...] The day my daddy died" (Edwards' father had died on that date), thinking that Whitfield was getting too personal. Edwards, like most people, was at the time unaware that the song was not written with him in mind and was in fact first recorded by lesser-known Motown artists The Undisputed Truth.
<ul><li> The live cover by George Michael is also well known.
</li><li> Meanwhile, The Undisputed Truth's best-known hit, "Smiling Faces Sometimes," also a Whitfield-Strong composition, was first recorded by... The Temptations.
</li><li> "War", yet another Whitfield-Strong composition originally performed by The Temptations, is more widely known for Edwin Starr's rendition. The Temptations' version, released on their 1970 album <em>Psychedelic Shack</em>, proved popular with fans who opposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, and there was demand for it to be released as a single. However, there was concern that the controversial subject matter might negatively affect the sales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Motown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Motown">Motown</a>'s most popular male act, so it was rearranged for the less-well-known Starr to perform, and his version was released as a single instead.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a>'s "One Love (People Get Ready)", as featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExodusAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ExodusAlbum">Exodus</a></em>, is much more famous than The Impressions' original "People Get Ready". Marley wisely used the original title in brackets.
</li><li> Remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DuranDuran">Duran Duran</a>'s original "Ordinary World"? If you're of the younger generations, you likely know it from the 2000 trance cover by Aurora, featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">DDRMAX</a></em>.
</li><li> Unless you've never once watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em>, it's hard to imagine "Pennsylvania Polka" by anyone other than Frankie Yankovic with back vocals. It was first recorded for the film "Give Out, Sisters" (1942) by The Andrews Sisters.
</li><li> "Perfect Moment", made famous by Martine McCutcheon, was originally by Edyta Gorniak.
</li><li> Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station's' song "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps". The song was originally "Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s, Quiz&aacute;s", written in Spanish by a Cuban composer in 1947. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DorisDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DorisDay">Doris Day</a> wasn't even the first to sing it in English: that honor goes to one Tony Bavaar. The Spanish original has been sung by practically every ballad / Bolero singer ever, to the point that no one remembers who sang it first.
</li><li> "Pesenka", by Russian group Ruki Vverkh, was covered in English by ATC as "Around the World". When <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeFour">Be Four</a> did their own English version with different lyrics than ATC's, titled "Magic Melody", many accused them of ripping off the ATC song.
</li><li> "Piece of Heaven" by Akira was originally by A7 (not to be confused with Avenged Sevenfold, whose common acronym is <em>A7X</em>), which had some off the same producers. Dune also did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong">Suspiciously Similar Song</a> version called "Heaven", which was banned from release (along with, in effect, <em>the entire album it was supposed to be on</em>) due to a plagiarism lawsuit.
</li><li> "Piece of My Heart" may be a contender for grand prize winner, as Faith Hill <em>herself</em> didn't know it was a cover song when it was selected for her to perform. Of course, it also fits the trope in that the most famous version, by Janis Joplin, eclipsed awareness of the original by Erma Franklin (sister of Aretha).
</li><li> Would you believe that Natalie Cole's 1988 smash hit "Pink Cadillac" was originally written and recorded by <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a></strong>? In fact, before his version was even released, Springsteen vetoed a request by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler">Bette Midler</a> to record her own version of it on the grounds that it wasn't a "girl's song".
</li><li> Overall "Poison" is known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> song, however quite a number of younger fans know of the Groove Coverage cover before the original.
</li><li> A Clash favorite, "Police on My Back", was first recorded by reggae rock group The Equals (best known for having a pre-"Electric Avenue" Eddy Grant as its guitarist) and released as a single in 1968.
</li><li> Though neither song is terribly well remembered these days, when people think of "Poor Poor Pitiful Me" and "Hasten Down the Wind," they're more likely to think of Linda Ronstadt than Warren Zevon. In country circles, when they hear the former they think of Terri Clark rather than Linda Ronstadt.
</li><li> "Popcorn" was first preformed by Gershon Kingsley, but was made famous by Hot Butter's cover.
</li><li> "Popopopopose" was originally from the children's show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InaiInaiBaa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InaiInaiBaa">Inai Inai Baa!</a></em>, but the cover by J-Pop act GReeeeN is more well-known than the original song.
</li><li> <em>Private Number</em> is an interesting song and illustrates the tendency of soul music fans and heavy rock fans not to overlap to any perceptible degree. Those who know the song via the heavy rock version by Babe Ruth (1970) are often genuinely surprised to discover it's a cover of a soul song by Judy Clay and William Bell (1968) and not the original.
</li><li> "Puttin' on the Ritz" was famously Covered Up several times, including a techno-pop version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> Taco in the 1980s. Taco's version was a homage to Fred Astaire, who merely introduced the <em>familiar</em> version of the Irving Berlin song (with lyrics about "Park Avenue" rather than "Lenox Avenue"). In turn, Shiny Toy Guns did a cover based on Taco's version. And, of course, there's the segment of the population who know it best sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein">Frankenstein</a>. Of course, it's perhaps best that Taco and subsequent artists covered Fred Astaire's version, considering the original version nowadays suffers from a bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.

</li><li> Weird version: in Brazil, the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEliteSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEliteSquad">The Elite Squad</a></em> brought much attention to the opening theme, a 90's song called "Rap das Armas". Yet somehow people mostly played a cover <em>which was not in the film</em> (which even was remixed by European DJs and became a hit in the Netherlands and Scandinavia).
</li><li> No, "Reason to Believe" was not written by Wilson Phillips. Rod Stewart released that one in 1971, before any of the members of Wilson Phillips even started school (two were born in 1968, the other in 1969). The Carpenters recorded it as an album track in 1970; it was written by Tim Hardin.
</li><li> Neil Diamond first wrote and released the acoustic ballad "Red Red Wine" in 1968. Fifteen years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UB40" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UB40">UB 40</a> took it, gave it a reggae spin based on Tony Tribe's 1969 cover, added a toasted "rap" section, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20403_6-famous-songs-written-by-last-person-youd-expect_p2.html">turned it into the megahit you know today<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. UB40 was unaware of the Neil Diamond version - but Diamond liked it anyway, at least enough to record a reggae version of his own.
</li><li> "Respect" was originally recorded by Otis Redding before Aretha Franklin sang it. In Otis's version it's the man demanding respect from his money-hungry wife.
</li><li> "Ring of Fire" was first recorded as "(Love's) Ring of Fire" by Anita Carter, sister of June Carter Cash who wrote the song along with Merle Kilgore, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> turned it into a hit.
</li><li> "Rivers of Babylon" was performed by The Melodians before it became a hit for Boney M.
<ul><li> Modern-day listeners probably know the version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sublime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sublime">Sublime</a> best. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">the lyrics are an expanded version of Psalm 137</a> with Rastafarian elements (such as "King Alpha").
</li></ul></li><li> "Rock Around the Clock", forever associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillHaleyAndHisComets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillHaleyAndHisComets">Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</a>, was not recorded by them first. That honor went to Sonny Dae and his Knights, whose version was released in early 1954. While Haley and his group did perform it live as early as 1953, their producer at their then-label Essex refused to record the song, forcing them to wait until they signed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeccaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeccaRecords">Decca Records</a> in 1954 to record it (though rumors of a 1953 demo persist despite denials by Haley and his bandmates).
</li><li> "Rockin' All Over the World" is perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StatusQuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StatusQuo">Status Quo</a>'s most famous post-1960s song, with them memorably opening the Live Aid concerts with their megahit version of it in London in 1985. It had originally been written, recorded, and released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">John Fogerty</a> ten years earlier.

In Japan is known as a cover song, but in the West is mostly credited as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PsychoLeCemu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PsychoLeCemu">Psycho le C&eacute;mu</a> song, which was made in 2003.
</li><li> "Rosalie", written by Bob Seger in tribute to a Windsor, Ontario radio executive and first recorded for his <em>Back in '72</em> LP, but much better known in Thin Lizzy's rendition for their live album <em>Armed and Dangerous</em>.
<ul><li> It probably doesn't hurt that Seger himself has kept <em>Back in '72</em> out of print since the '70s due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A cover of it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonaLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonaLewis">Leona Lewis</a> in the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge was enough to make everybody forget that &#147;Run&#148; was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnowPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnowPatrol">Snow Patrol</a> song (a stat backed up by YouTube views, where the original version has less than two-fifths the views of the cover).
</li><li> Placebo's "Running Up That Hill" and Maxwell's "This Woman's Work" have both managed to eclipse the original versions by Kate Bush in the U.S.
</li><li> McBride &amp; the Ride's biggest hit, "Sacred Ground," was released by Kix Brooks two years before he became one-half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>.
</li><li> "Sailing" is probably best known to younger generations as an *NSYNC song. Older generations (plus <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YachtRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YachtRock">Yacht Rock</a></em> addicts) are more likely to remember the 1980 original, which gave its writer and performer Christopher Cross a US #1 hit and three Grammy Awards (plus a leg up on a fourth Grammy). Here's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX9z_hU7cts">a performance<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in 1999 of the song featuring Cross and the boys.
<ul><li> Another song called "Sailing" (no relation to the Christopher Cross song) that is best remembered as a hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a> in 1975&#151;particularly in the UK&#151;was written by Gavin Sutherland and originally recorded by he and his brother Iain, as the duo The Sutherland Brothers, in 1972.
</li></ul></li><li> Unless you're into Brazilian dance music, the whole genre of Brazilian samba is probably covered up by Bellini's "Samba de Janeiro"/"Samba do Brasil" for you.
</li><li> "Saving All My Love for You" was originally performed by Marilyn McCoo. The hit version was by Whitney Houston.
</li><li> "Say I Am (What I Am)" was a #21 hit for Tommy James and the Shondells in 1966; it was originally recorded by The Fireballs (the group's lead guitarist George Tomsco co-wrote it with his wife Barbara), but despite their label issuing the song twice (once as "What I Am", then as "Say I Am" after the Shondells version became a hit), their version never became a hit.
</li><li> "Sea of Love" is <em>not</em> originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatPower">Cat Power</a> nor by The Honeydrippers nor, for that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">Led Zeppelin</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note492nf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note492nf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note492nf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">an understandable error, considering that The Honeydrippers was formed by Robert Plant and also featured Jimmy Page</span>. It was by Phil Phillips from way back in the Fifties.
</li><li> "Say That We're Sweethearts Again" is from the 1946 film <em>Meet The People</em>, and sung by Virginia O'Brien, but more modern audiences know it as being sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a> in the <em>'<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Harlequinade".
</li><li> "Scarborough Fair", known worldwide thanks to Simon and Garfunkel, is a traditional British folk song. Paul Simon learned the song in London from English folk singer Martin Carthy. To the annoyance of Carthy and other English musicians, only Simon and Garfunkel were credited for their version, without any mention of "traditional". (They did, however, write the antiwar song "Canticle" sung in their version as a countermelody.)
</li><li> "Secret Base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~" by ZONE was a major hit in Japan when it was released in 2001 and continues to be a popular summer song there. However, it's virtually unknown in the West and is easily overshadowed by the cover version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune">used as the ending theme</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Anohana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Anohana">anohana</a></em>.
</li><li> "Set the Night to Music" is best known as a U.S. top-10 duet by Roberta Flack with Maxi Priest in 1991. Not many people know now that it was first recorded four years earlier by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starship">Starship</a>.
</li><li> "Seven Day Fool" is better remembered as a Jully Black song than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EttaJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EttaJames">Etta James</a> song.
</li><li> A year before Pat Benatar recorded "Shadows of the Night", lesser-known vocalist Helen Schneider <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A87dd7Rtt4">produced the song originally.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Schneider's version though has different lyrics, and a much different "theme" than Benatar's, which is mostly a song about a couple facing the world; Schneider's version seems to be about the fear of becoming your parents.
</li><li> Three Dog Night's "Shambala" was originally done by a country singer named <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BWStevenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BWStevenson">BW Stevenson</a>.
</li><li> The 1946 song "Shaving Cream" by Benny Bell was covered by the reggae/soca group The Fabulous Five in the 1970s, and still is considered a classic soca song in the West Indies, while the original has mostly been forgotten.
</li><li> "She's All I Got" was first a hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> Freddie North before Johnny Paycheck sent his cover to #2 on the country charts. Later on, Tracy Byrd had a big country hit with his version, which still gets played on the radio to this day, making this another example of a cover-up of a cover-up.
</li><li> "She's the One", best known as a #1 UK single for Robbie Williams in 1999, but originally recorded by World Party on their 1997 album <em>Egyptology</em>. Robbie Williams' version is so close to the original that World Party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">singer/songwriter</a> Karl Wallinger has remarked "The only difference between my version and Robbie's is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">I know who 'she' is.</a>"
</li><li> "Shivers" is quite probably the biggest single the Australian band Screaming Jets ever produced. It's probably best known as a Nick Cave song, which, just to add insult to injury, also gets the lyrics wrong ("All alcohol and cigarettes" becomes the totally inexplicable "Our love could hold on cigarettes"). In fact the song was written and first performed by Rowland S. Howard and The Young Charlatans in 1977. It was then recorded (covered, technically) by Howard's later band The Boys Next Door two years later. It was also covered by Divine Fits on their 2012 debut album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cher">Cher</a> isn't the first singer who sang "The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)", although her version is indeed quite popular due to the fact it was released at around the same time as her movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mermaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mermaids">Mermaids</a> in 1990. The song dated much older: The first version is by Betty Everett in 1964.
</li><li> Most people don't know the song "Shout 2000" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a> is a cover of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears">Tears for Fears</a> song "Shout". Yes, the same people who gave us "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" and "Mad World" made a song later covered by Disturbed. <a class="urllink" href="http://twitter.com/#!/DAVIDMDRAIMAN/status/146653968557285376">Disturbed's lead singer claims<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that Curt Smith himself heard the cover and "loved it."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIsleyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheIsleyBrothers">The Isley Brothers</a>: "Shout!", which is mostly associated with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse">Animal House</a></em>.
</li><li> "A Simple Game" is usually associated with the Four Tops, but was originally the B-side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues">The Moody Blues</a>' single "Ride My See-Saw".
</li><li> "Since You Been Gone" was written and first recorded by Russ Ballard, though nowadays people tend to think of the cover by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a> when they think of it.
</li><li> The classic <em>Sing (a song)</em> from <em>Sesame Street</em>. One of Joe Reposo's composition, in many markets (particularly in Asia), The Carpenters' cover is more popular or more fondly remembered than the multiple performances the song has had on the show.
</li><li> The swing classic "Sing, Sing, Sing" was made famous by Benny Goodman and his Orchestra but it was originally a song with lyrics sung by Louis Prima.
</li><li> "Skinnamarink" is a traditional children's song that's best known for its' cover by Canadian children's group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SharonLoisAndBramsElephantShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SharonLoisAndBramsElephantShow">Sharon, Lois and Bram</a>. The connection between the song and the group was so strong that their second TV show, as well as a skating rink in Canada, were both named after the song.
</li><li> "Sky High" by Jigsaw is better known through either the Eurodance version by Newton, or DJ Miko's version, which was featured in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> series.
</li><li> "Sloop John B", made famous by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds">Pet Sounds</a></em>, is a West Indies folk song dating back to at least 1917 (as "Wreck of the John B"). The band did rework the tune pretty radically, however, so it could almost count as an original composition. (In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianWilson">Brian Wilson</a> is the only songwriter credited for the tune.)
<ul><li> Before the Beach Boys, the Kingston Trio also had a fairly prominent version.
</li></ul></li><li> "Slow Jam" by Gyrl is better remembered as a Usher and Monica collaboration.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sublime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sublime">Sublime</a>'s "Smoke Two Joints" was originally by The Toyes.
</li><li> "Smokin' In the Boys' Room" was a hit for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluesRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluesRock">Blues Rock</a> band Brownsville Station in 1973. The 1985 cover by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e</a> is probably better known; the video has been a staple of "best of the eighties" retrospectives on music channels for years and the original was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> while the Crue version was their first top 40 song.
</li><li> Unless you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> fan, you might very well associate "So Help Me Girl" with Gary Barlow (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakeThatBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TakeThatBand">Take That</a> fame) instead of Joe Diffie. Particularly if you're British.
</li><li> "Somebody to Love" (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">that</a> one) is often claimed to be originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>. In fact, the original is by their former competitors The Great Society, originally titled "Someone to Love", and was recorded two years earlier. That said, it got to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Jefferson Airplane</a> when The Great Society was dissolved and the Slick siblings joined the Airplane and took their own songs with them. Hence, Grace Slick sings both versions.
</li><li> "Someday At Christmas" is better remembered as a Jackson 5 song than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder">Stevie Wonder</a> one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarrieUnderwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarrieUnderwood">Carrie Underwood</a> was not the first singer to record the Diane Warren song "Some Hearts", but her version was the most successful. It was originally written by Warren for Belinda Carlisle in 1987, but she wound up not including it on her album. It was then recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> singer Marshall Crenshaw in 1989 and released as a single, but did not chart. Kelly Levesque, a now-obscure pop singer, recorded yet another version for the 2001 romantic comedy <em>America's Sweethearts</em>, but it was also not a hit. The fourth time was the charm, and Underwood's version has become a staple of adult contemporary radio since its 2005 release.
</li><li> "Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart" was a big international hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Marc Almond</a> and Gene Pitney in 1988. However, the song was originally recorded by David &amp; Jonathan, then by Pitney himself, in 1967. The song was subsequently covered by artists ranging from Cilla Black and Vicky Leandros to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave">Nick Cave</a>.
</li><li> Due to its use in a John Lewis Christmas advert, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Keane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Keane">Keane</a>'s <em>Somewhere Only We Know</em> is more likely to be associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilyAllen">Lily Allen</a>.
</li><li> "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> is not a perfect example. The famous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bFr2SWP1I">version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole is easily the most well-known arrangement aside from the version done for the movie (by Judy Garland). If you see someone singing / playing that song nowadays, there's a 50% chance that it's usually done in the style of the Kamakawiwo'ole arrangement, i.e. done with a guitar (or a ukulele) and sung softly with "ooooh's" in it (and/or mashed up with "What A Wonderful World").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a>'s cover of "The Sound of Silence" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SimonAndGarfunkel">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a> is the first version that comes up when you search the song on Youtube.
</li><li> Whichever version of "Sous le ciel de Paris" ("Under the Sky of Paris") you'll regard as the ultimate one - Edith Piaf's, Yves Montand's etc - it's definitely not the one sung by Jean Bretonni&egrave;re in the eponymous film (he also composed the song).
</li><li> The theme tune to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarFleet">Star Fleet</a></em> (a Japanese 1980s sci-fi TV show originally called 'X-Bomber' and redubbed for UK transmission with a new theme song) was Covered Up when Brian May of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> recorded it with some friends, including Eddie Van Halen and released as a mini-album called "Star Fleet Project". Consequently it's often thought that Brian May wrote the song, despite him stating clearly on the sleevenotes to the record that it was originally by Paul Bliss.
</li><li> "Stars", which younger audiences (specifically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> fans, thanks to its usage in the season 3 finale) associate with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinaSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinaSimone">Nina Simone</a>, was originally written and performed by Janis Ian (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">that one</a>).
</li><li> "State Of Independence" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Jon Anderson</a> feat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vangelis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vangelis">Vangelis</a>. The version you may recognize is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonnaSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonnaSummer">Donna Summer</a>.
</li><li> The song "Stay" by Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, although a top-charting record and featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing">Dirty Dancing</a></em>, is often better known nowadays for the (considerably longer) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacksonBrowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacksonBrowne">Jackson Browne</a> cover. To confuse the issue, "The Load Out", which segues into the cover of "Stay", actually <em>was</em> written by Jackson Browne, but they're played together so often that people don't even realized they're technically two separate songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> released "Stone Cold Crazy" in 1974; the song was played often live but didn't become well known. In 1990, Metallica released a cover that won them a Grammy and got them an invitation to the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert (where lead singer James Hetfield did the song with Queen backing him up).
</li><li> An interesting subversion. "Stir It Up" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatchAFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatchAFire">Catch a Fire</a></em>, which everyone knows as a Marley song, was originally performed by Johnny Nash, though it was written by Marley and Peter Tosh for Nash, as they worked for him as songwriters before they became famous on their own. They later both covered their own song.
</li><li> "Strawberry Letter 23" by Shuggie Otis. The version you may recognize is by the Brothers Johnson.
</li><li> "Streets of Bakersfield" is best known as a #1 country hit in 1988 for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DwightYoakam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DwightYoakam">Dwight Yoakam</a>, featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuckOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuckOwens">Buck Owens</a> as a guest artist. Owens was actually the first to record the song in 1973.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DragonForce">DragonForce</a>'s "Strike of the Ninja" is a version of "Feel the Fire" by DragonForce side project Shadow Warriors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> recorded the song "St. James Infirmary", as it appeared on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCompleteHotFiveAndHotSevenRecordings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCompleteHotFiveAndHotSevenRecordings">The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings</a></em>, back in the late 1920s. If that sounds old to you, keep in mind that the song ultimately derives from an English folk song that dates back to, at the very latest, <em>1531</em> - that's when the original St. James Infirmary (a leper hospital for maidens and nuns) was torn down. It probably dates back a few decades earlier at least, and may therefore predate <em>the discovery of the New World</em>.
</li><li> Bobby Hebb's song "Sunny" is well-known but the more danceable and upbeat Boney M. cover is more popular.
</li><li> Anna Naklab's cover of "Supergirl" is more popular than the original by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Reamonn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Reamonn">Reamonn</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> covered an obscure song by The Clique, "Superman", on one of their albums, and many people think it's by them, to the point where people yelled at them for selling out... when someone else covered it again and it was used in a commercial.
<ul><li> Any cover song R.E.M. recorded for their studio albums qualifies as this. Also of note is "Strange", originally recorded by UK punk band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wire">Wire</a>,
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueOysterCult">Blue &Ouml;yster Cult</a> also covered "Dancing in the Ruins" by The Clique, though this trope is probably averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">Small Reference Pools</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LutherVandross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LutherVandross">Luther Vandross</a>' "Superstar" wasn't the first version, nor was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters">Carpenters</a>' &mdash; Richard decided to cover it after hearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler">Bette Midler</a> sing it on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em>; it was written by Leon Russell.
</li><li> "Surfin' Bird" by The Trashmen is a combination of two songs by The Rivingtons: "Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow" and "The Bird's the Word".
</li><li> Though Al Jolson recorded the definitive version of "Swanee" and performed the song in one of his touring productions, it had been introduced before in an obscure Broadway show by a female singer. Many decades later, musical arrangements from that show were exhumed and recorded for the CD <em>Broadway Showstoppers</em>.
</li><li> "Suzie Q" is probably best remembered as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> song, but the song was originally penned and performed by Dale Hawkins and the Astronauts. CCR did extend the song to over eight minutes, something that John Fogerty said was due to the cover being made for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> radio station. It has also been covered numerous other times as well, including one by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> that came out two years before the CCR version.
</li><li> Few people know that legendary "Sway" (recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanMartin">Dean Martin</a> and many others) was originally a Mexican instrumental song titled "&iquest;Qui&eacute;n ser&aacute;?" (composed by Luis Demetrio and Pablo Beltr&aacute;n Ruiz).
</li><li> Most people know the song "Sweet Victory" as 'that song' in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> episode 'Band Geeks'. Few people actually know its actually a real, obscure song by David Glen Eisley, formerly of '80s one-hit wonder Giuffria.
</li><li> Fans of late sixties/early seventies music will <em>certainly</em> be more familiar with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground">Velvet Underground</a> and Lou Reed solo versions of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Sweet Jane</a>," with or without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">excised half-minute</a>, but others today would probably be quicker to recognize the very, <em>very</em> different Cowboy Junkies version, based on a slow, mostly ad-lib live version from before the album was out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">thanks to it being used in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaturalBornKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NaturalBornKillers">Natural Born Killers</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a> episode, etc., etc.
</li><li> The Holidaymakers' "Sweet Lovers" dominated the New Zealand charts and music awards in 1988. It's a cover of a 1985 Bill Withers single.
</li><li> You might know the blues standard "Sweet Home Chicago" from the Blues Brothers version, or perhaps Eric Clapton or Stevie Ray Vaughan. But the very earliest recorded version is by Robert Johnson, although he didn't exactly write it (don't ask).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">Lorde</a>'s cover of "Swingin' Party" is easily better known than the original by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReplacements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReplacements">The Replacements</a>. It's not one of her better-known songs, being a B-Side, but the original was very obscure as it was never released as a single and the band themselves only had a cult following.
</li><li> Some have attributed "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," a historic Negro spiritual, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a>.
</li><li> "Tainted Love", often thought of as a song about AIDS, first came out in 1964. Ed Cobb wrote and Gloria Jones sang the original version. (Thank you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>!) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a>, of course, immortalized the song, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>'s cover likely the second best known. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a> recorded their version alongside <em>another</em> cover &mdash; "Where Did Our Love Go", originally recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes">The Supremes</a> and also released in 1964. Soft Cell's recording combined this and "Tainted Love" into one song, though most radio stations opted to fade out after "Tainted Love" instead.
</li><li> Nowadays, "Taka Takata" is probably best known as a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeDassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeDassin">Joe Dassin</a> song, but it was originally performed by a Spanish singer Paco Paco.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a>' cover of "Take Me To The River", by Al Green and Mabon Hodges. Also covered by The Woodshed, The Radiators, Ratdog, Grateful Dead, God Johnson, Escape Goat, Diesel Dog, Day By The River, Bockmans Euphio, Annie Lennox, Max on the Rox, Dave Matthews Band, Bryan Ferry, Mana, that funny singing fish that also does "Don't Worry, Be Happy", and others. It's a popular song.
</li><li> "Talk" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay">Coldplay</a> isn't entirely originally by them. It's based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>'s "Computerliebe", but it became a much bigger hit and much more popular among an audience too young to even know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> in the first place.
</li><li> "Tear-Stained Letter", one of only two big hits for Cajun-country singer Jo-El Sonnier, is a cover of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson">Richard Thompson</a> song. Most Americans, at least, are probably completely unaware that it's a cover.
<ul><li> Similarly, "1952 Vincent Black Lightning" was originally by Richard as well- Del McCoury topped the bluegrass charts with it, changing "Box Hill" to "Knoxville."
</li><li> Meanwhile, "Dimming of the Day" is by neither Bonnie Raitt or Alison Krauss, it's RT again.
</li></ul></li><li> "Tennessee Flat Top Box", a #1 hit for Rosanne Cash, was previously a #11 hit for her father. You know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>. Even she didn't know that her own father wrote the song until after she recorded it.
</li><li> "Thank You For Being a Friend" was a hit for Andrew Gold in 1978. However, the song is better remembered as the theme tune to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>, which used a cover version sung by Cynthia Fee.
</li><li> "Thank You For Being You" is best known for its appearance on not one, but two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></em> tribute albums: 2005's <em>Songs From The Neighborhood</em>, which featured Amy Grant, BJ Thomas, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonnaSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonnaSummer">Donna Summer</a> and others, and 2019's <em>Thank You, Mister Rogers: Music &amp; Memories</em>, which had among its roster Kellie Pickler, Vanessa Williams and Tom Bergeron. The song was originally written for the Canadian-produced, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBSKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBSKids">PBS Kids</a>-aired series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em> as the song the puppets sang to show Noah how much they loved him in the season 1 finale, "Noah's Leaving". Aside from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewrittenPopVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewrittenPopVersion">only two verses from the original song are kept</a> in the <em>Mister Rogers</em> version ("Words could never measure, a gift would be too small/But more than any treasure, we love you most of all"). Interestingly enough, Dennis Scott also wrote the original <em>Noddy Shop</em> version of the song.
</li><li> The Grammy for Song of the Year for 1986 went to the Gladys Knight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder">Stevie Wonder</a> and Dionne Warwick version of "That's What Friends Are For". Few realize this is a cover of a song recorded four years earlier by Rod Stewart for the movie <em>Night Shift</em>.
</li><li> Most people think of "The City of New Orleans" as either an Arlo Guthrie song (if they're folk fans) or a Willie Nelson song (if they're country fans). The song was in fact written by folksinger Steve Goodman<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56lnz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note56lnz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56lnz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">also known by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Chicago Cubs</a> fans as writer of the team's current victory song, "Go, Cubs, Go"</span>. To be fair, Gododman sought out Guthrie to record it.
</li><li> One for the Irish: "The Galway Girl" was not written by Mundy, or Sharron Shannon, <em>or</em> any other Irish singer song writer you might have confused Mundy with; it was written by Steve Earle.
</li><li> For some, Cake's "The Guitar Man" (by Bread).
</li><li> "The In Crowd" is by Dobie Gray (cue tropers running to the Other Wiki). But who would be more iconic and fitting to cover this title than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoxyMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoxyMusic">Brian Ferry?</a>
</li><li> "The Lady is a Tramp," from the musical <em>Babes in Arms</em>, is most famous as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> song. It doesn't help that the well-known movie version didn't include the song. Also, the licensed version of the show changed one line in the song to say, "For Frank Sinatra I holler and stamp."
</li><li> "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" did not originate with Tight Fit, nor with The Tokens. It started out as a song named "Mbube" by South African singer Solomon Linda and his group, The Evening Birds, in 1939. In 1951, Pete Seeger and his band, The Weavers, released their own version, renamed "Wimoweh" (based on misheard lyrics), whereas The Tokens recorded their own version based on the Weavers' version, now named "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", with the now familiar lyrics, in 1961. All three versions of the song have been covered multiple times, and quite a few versions (particularly the ones based on the Tokens' version) have become hits.
<ul><li> The story is actually ridiculously sad. Linda and the Morning Birds, by law in South Africa at the time, couldn't receive royalties for their music, and received a "petty cash voucher" instead. When Pete Seeger brought the song to America, he didn't check to ensure that Linda received the royalties he was due, and again, Linda was left with a tiny cash sum. He eventually died impoverished and it was 15 years before a stone was placed on his grave. In 2000, it was estimated that, had he received what he was due, he and his heirs would have earned upwards of $15 million just from its use in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theater/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theater/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em>. Eventually his heirs did reach a settlement with the record company, with the money placed in a trust.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Three Bells" (aka "Jimmy Brown") is this in the US, where The Browns' cover overshadowed Edith Piaf's French original ("Les Trois Cloches") in fame if not in quality. Then again, Piaf, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">for obvious reasons</a>, only included the Swiss song in her repertoire six years after it was written (though it hadn't been released as a recording before that - just played on radio and performed in cabarets). And then there was also "While The Angelus Was Ringing" cover of the same song...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie">Blondie</a>'s "The Tide Is High" is a gender-flipped cover of a classic 1967 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">rocksteady</a> song by the Jamaican band The Paragons. It's been covered since and accredited to Debbie Harry in one of the newer versions.
</li><li> Most people think of "The Power of Love" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CelineDion">C&eacute;line Dion</a> tune, but it was written by Jennifer Rush and recorded by her as well as by Air Supply and Laura Branigan. However, Jennifer Rush's original was massive in the UK; it topped the charts for several weeks in 1985.
</li><li> "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" was originally a jump blues song by Tiny Bradshaw that has been covered numerous times, with the most famous being by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>.
</li><li> "Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye" was a pop hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a> act The Casinos in the 1960s. One year after its release, Eddy Arnold had a #1 country hit with it, and Neal McCoy sent a cover to #4 in 1996. But before all <em>that</em>, its writer, John D. Loudermilk, recorded it.
</li><li> "There's No Way Out of Here" was NOT by David Gilmour- it was by a lesser-known band named Unicorn. Gilmour had produced their second album, however. Monster Magnet's recent cover may be better known these days than either of their versions, though.
</li><li> "The Twist", the song that started the whole Twist dance craze, wasn't originally by Chubby Checker, who is so strongly associated with the dance that it's almost all he's known for. The original version was recorded a year earlier by Hank Ballard and the Midnighters.
</li><li> "They Don't Know" by Tracey Ullman, covering Kirsty MacColl, who performed backing vocals on the Ullman version. In fact, the "Baby!" after the musical interlude in Ullman's version is actually MacColl, as Ullman couldn't reach the note.
</li><li> "Think Twice", covered by Alana Dante and M.G., and performed live by Kelly Clarkson, was originally by Celine Dion.
</li><li> "Third Rate Romance" was originally sung by The Amazing Rhythm Aces, and they took it to number 1 on the Canadian RPM Country chart. Most people, however, remember Sammy Kershaw's cover from the '90s, which he took to number 2 on the Billboard Hot Country chart (wherein the original stalled just outside the top 10).
</li><li> Billy Joel's "This Night" from <em>An Innocent Man</em> is better known to Classical artists as Movement 2 of Beethoven's "Sonata Pathetique".
<ul><li> As is "Midnight Blue" by Louise Tucker.
</li></ul></li><li> "This Is Halloween," the song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNightmareBeforeChristmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></em>, was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DannyElfman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DannyElfman">Danny Elfman</a>, not (as several lyrics websites seem to think) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>.
<ul><li> "This Ole House" was originally made by Stuart Hamblen, but in Sweden the Swedish-language cover "Trettifyran," performed by Per Myrberg, is vastly more famous.
</li></ul></li><li> "This Wheels on Fire"...borderline case. While it's probably widely known it's by Bob Dylan &amp; The Band, the version you most probably remember is the title melody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a></em>, by Brian Auger. (Which again isn't the version by Brian Auger&amp;Trinity which climbed highest in the charts...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiouxsieAndTheBanshees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiouxsieAndTheBanshees">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>, anyone?)
</li><li> "This Woman's Work" by Maxwell is actually a cover of a 1989 song by the British singer Kate Bush.
</li><li> "Those Were The Days" of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHopkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHopkin">Mary Hopkin</a> fame is a slightly remastered Russian romance song <em>&#1044;&#1086;&#1088;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086;&#1081; &#1076;&#1083;&#1080;&#1085;&#1085;&#1086;&#1102;</em> ("On A Long Road") with new lyrics. Unsurprisingly, completely averted in ex-USSR countries, where few know of the existence of the cover.
</li><li> "Time Is on My Side" wasn't composed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a>. It was composed by Jerry Ragovoy in 1963 as an instrumental number for jazz trombonist Kai Winding (who had recent success with his cover of "More", the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MondoCane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MondoCane">Mondo Cane</a></em>); the lyrics were added by Jimmy Norman for a cover by Irma Thomas in early 1964, which formed the basis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>' version.
</li><li> "Tobacco Road" has been popularly remembered through Blues Magoos, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">the Nashville Teens</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth">David Lee Roth</a>. The original by John D. Loudermilk, however...
</li><li> Emmylou Harris' "Together Again" is so associated with her that many people forget that its writer, Buck Owens, had a #1 hit with it first.
</li><li> "Too Lost In You" by the Sugababes is a cover of a Patricia Kaas song called "Quand j'ai peur du tout".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1XWJN3nJo">"Torn"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as performed by Natalie Imbruglia, is a cover of a song written by the obscure American alternative rock band <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1SH1YdITDI">"Ednaswap"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. (Many of Ednaswap's members were &mdash; and still are &mdash; successful songwriters that wrote for other performers.)
<ul><li> A whole bunch of different performers cut the song before Imbruglia - most of the versions (Ednaswap's and Imbruglia's included) were produced by the song's co-writer Phil Thornalley.
</li></ul></li><li> Travis Tritt hit the charts with the bar tune "T-R-O-U-B-L-E", which he also named his third album. The song was originally sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, "Where Corn Don't Grow" was originally recorded by Waylon Jennings.
</li></ul></li><li> "Try a Little Tenderness" was a big-band pop number from the Thirties, by the composer of "When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)." Aretha Franklin and Sam Cooke covered it as a straightforward soul ballad. Then Otis Redding picked it up from Cooke, made it build from a slow beginning to an explosive conclusion, and wiped every previous version from memory.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SavageGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SavageGarden">Savage Garden</a> sung "Truly, Madly, Deeply" first but many younger fans attribute it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada">Cascada</a>.
</li><li> This is a pretty obscure example, but the 4 Strings song "Turn It Around" is a cover of an earlier song also called "Turn It Around" and also produced by Carlo Resoort, performed by Alena.
</li><li> "Tsubasa wo Kudasai", the insert song played at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Evangelion 2.0</a>, is a Japanese folks' song from the 70s. A lot of people mistakenly assume it was taken from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>
</li><li> "Turn The Beat Around" by Vicky Sue Robinson, although its original charted slightly higher on the Hot 100, is better known to post-disco generations from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloriaEstefan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloriaEstefan">Gloria Estefan</a>'s 1994 cover for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpecialist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpecialist">The Specialist</a></em>'.
</li><li> There are quite a few people who don't know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a>' enormous hit "Turn! Turn! Turn!" was written and first performed by Pete Seeger. Seeger liked what The Byrds did with the song, and began performing it in their style. Now, its a little jarring to hear any recording Seeger made before The Byrds' cover. In turn, all of the lyrics - bar a single line and the title refrain - come from a specific portion of the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible.
</li><li> Another Jerry Jeff Walker song, "Trashy Women", was a popular hit for Confederate Railroad.
</li><li> "Two Little Boys" is subject to multiple levels of this. People who only know it casually (British people, at least) think it's a Rolf Harris song. People who listen to the lyrics tend to think it dates from (and is about) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. In fact the modern version of the song was published in 1903, is probably about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, and there are still earlier versions that probably date from the Napoleonic Wars.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>, known for writing her own songs, actually did a cover on <em>Fearless: Platinum Edition</em>. Few would suspect that the soft ballad "Untouchable" originated as a <em>rock song</em> by the Nashville band Luna Halo. (To Taylor's credit, however, the song was sufficiently altered that Luna Halo allowed her to take <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2009/11/24/nathan-barlowe-of-luna-halo-talks-about-taylor-swift-and-untouchable/">co-writing credit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for her version.)
</li><li> "Unbreakable Heart", recorded by Jessica Andrews, was originally cut by Carlene Carter.
</li><li> The most instantly recognizable version of "Unchained Melody" today is the Phil Spector-produced one by the Righteous Brothers (helped along by oldies radio and the film <em>Ghost</em>), but not only was it <em>not</em> the original, it was not even the first version of the song to become a hit &mdash; Les Baxter, Al Hibbler, and Roy Hamilton had all recorded top-ten hit versions of "Unchained Melody" in the US, and the British singer-turned-broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young had a #1 cover of it in the UK. LeAnn Rimes also had a Top 10 country hit with it in the late 90s. Also, the original version (for the movie <em>Unchained</em>) was Oscar-nominated for Best Song a full ten years before the Righteous Brothers recorded it.
</li><li> Buffy Sainte-Marie recorded the first version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtestSong">Protest Song</a> "Universal Soldier", which most people identify with the cover by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Donovan">Donovan</a>.
</li><li> Joe Yellow's Eurobeat song "U.S.A." is considerably less well known than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boy Band</a> DA PUMP's Japanese cover in 2018.
</li><li> "Valerie" was a Top 10 UK hit for indie rockers The Zutons in 2006. A cover by Mark Ronson and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmyWinehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmyWinehouse">Amy Winehouse</a> the next year reached #2 on the UK Chart and became an international smash hit, immediately destroying the original's radio presence - and the original band's potential popularity - forever.
</li><li> "Video Killed the Radio Star" was originally recorded by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club, then later by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBuggles">The Buggles</a>. Though it was actually written by both of them (the song was written by Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley, the first two of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBuggles">The Buggles</a>).
</li><li> <em>Volare</em> is of course a much-covered tune that most people associate with Dean Martin. The song's original title, though, was <em>Nel blu dipinto di blu</em> and was sung by Domenico Modugno (whose version topped the American charts, incidentally, 12 places higher than Dino's version). The original version also placed 3rd in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>.
</li><li> Those in the South may be familiar with Old Crow Medicine Show's original version of "Wagon Wheel", but most people probably got their first mainstream exposure to it through Darius Rucker's cover in 2013 (although a few other covers existed in between). Still, the song has sold more than a million digital copies, which means it's not totally obscure.
</li><li> Chances are, if you hear "Walking in Memphis" on the radio, most often it will be Cher's version instead of Marc Cohn's original...unless you live in North America, where Cohn's version still reigns supreme. Or if you're listening to a country station, where it'll be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a> version.
</li><li> "Walking in the Air" was first performed by Peter Auty in the movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSnowman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSnowman">The Snowman</a></em>. A few years later, Aled Jones shot to fame with a cover of the song, which became the definitive version. Later still, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nightwish">Nightwish</a> covered it for their album <em>Oceanborn</em>, causing many Nightwish fans to believe that their version was the original.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GraceJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GraceJones">Grace Jones</a>' version of "Warm Leatherette" is the best-known one, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5QErPDNcj4">the original<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was by Daniel Miller, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">a/k/a The Normal</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a>'s "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding?" was written and first performed by Costello's producer, Nick Lowe, while part of the band Brinsley Schwarz.
<ul><li> And, ironically, most of the money that Nick's made from music came neither from his solo career, nor from Elvis' hit, but from a lesser-known cover of the song by the relatively-obscure Curtis Stigers...because it happened to be on the soundtrack to The Bodyguard.
</li></ul></li><li> "Waiting For Tonight", better known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JenniferLopez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JenniferLopez">Jennifer Lopez</a> song, was originally by 3rd Party.
</li><li> Very few people know that two songs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s first album, "Warning" and "Evil Woman", are covers of respectively The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation and Crow, never mind that the latter song hit the top 20 on the charts.
</li><li> Rita Coolidge's recording of "We're All Alone" is probably the most commonly known, but the song was written and performed by Boz Scaggs for his album <em>Silk Degrees</em> in 1976. Coolidge's version came out a year later.
</li><li> "What Hurts the Most". Which artist do you think of first? Jo O'Meara, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts">Rascal Flatts</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada">Cascada</a>? If you're a country fan, probably Rascal Flatts. But before all <em>that</em>, Mark Wills recorded it.
</li><li> "Whataya Want from Me", best known from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert">Adam Lambert</a>, was originally recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a> for <em>Funhouse</em>, but rejected there. The P!nk version was eventually released on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits Album</a>.
</li><li> "What Would You Do?" was a song by City High before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bastille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bastille">Bastille</a> made a slower, more somber cover years later.
</li><li> "When The Stars Go Blue" was made famous on pop radio by The Corrs and on country radio by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a> but Ryan Adams' version predates both of those.
</li><li> Some country fans recognize the song "When You Say Nothing At All" as a beautiful song by Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station, and are surprised to learn that its first release was on a tribute to the late Keith Whitley, who both wrote and sang it in the '80s, when country wasn't cool.
<ul><li> Most Europeans will never have heard of Alison Krauss but <em>will</em> have encountered Ronan Keating's version of the song, included on the "Notting Hill" soundtrack.
</li></ul></li><li> "Whenever You Need Somebody" is best known as a Rick Astley song. Most people don't know that it was first performed by O'Chi Brown.
</li><li> "When I'm Gone", a 1998 dance hit by Latin Freestyle diva Rockell, was originally an obscure 1981 single by British soft rock artist Albert Hammond.
</li><li> "Where Do You Go", No Mercy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">sole song of note</a>, is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">an expanded cover</a> of an obscure La Bouche song (it uses the same bridge and chorus, but adds new verse lyrics).
</li><li> A large mass of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> are all quite surprised that Russell Watson's performance of "Where My Heart Will Take Me" (used as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a>'s</em> theme tune) is a cover of Rod Stewart's "Faith of the Heart".
</li><li> "Whiskey in the Jar" wasn't written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThinLizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>, nor the Pogues, nor Pulp, nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>. It's an old Irish folk song. Metallica's version is actually a cover of Thin Lizzy's take.
<ul><li> Similarly, Thin Lizzy later stitched several Irish folk songs together into the guitar showpiece "Black Rose".
</li></ul></li><li> You probably know "Who Let The Dogs Out" by the Baha Men, right? You probably don't know the original version by Fatt Jakk and his Pack of Pets. Which itself was a cover of "Doggie" by Anslem Douglas.
</li><li> "Who Knows Where The Time Goes" is better known as a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudyCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudyCollins">Judy Collins</a> song than a Sandy Denny song.
</li><li> Jerry Lee Lewis' big hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" was originally performed by blues belter Big Maybelle.
</li><li> "Why Baby Why" has been a #1 hit for Red Sovine (as a duet with Webb Pierce) and later for Charley Pride, as well as a Top 10 hit for Hank Locklin. The first version was by George Jones, whose version peaked at #4 (its chart run having been eclipsed by the Sovine/Pierce duet). Still, since Jones is by far the most famous person to have sung the song, this might be averted now.
</li><li> "Why Don't You Do Right?" was not created for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em>. It dates back to 1936, with a famous version by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeggyLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeggyLee">Peggy Lee</a> dating to 1950.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> song "Wild Horses" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StickyFingers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StickyFingers">Sticky Fingers</a></em> is a bit complicated. See, Mick and Keith wrote it back in 1969/1970 or so. Gram Parsons came around, heard it, liked it, asked if he could cover it. Mick 'n Keef said yes, so he puts it out on The Flying Burrito Brothers' debut album in 1970. Then in 1971, The Stones put their own version on <em>Sticky Fingers</em>. Cue much confusion as to who recorded it first.
<ul><li> And a later generation found the song due to it being featured in a third-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffytheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffytheVampireSlayer">Buffythe Vampire Slayer</a></em>, performed by British group The Sundays.
</li></ul></li><li> "Wild Night" was originally written and performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a> and was a minor hit in 1971. The 1994 version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMellencamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMellencamp">John Mellencamp</a> and Meshell Ndegeocello was a Top 10 hit.
</li><li> "Wild One", aka "Real Wild Child" is best known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IggyPop">Iggy Pop</a>'s take in 1986, but was actually recorded as far back as 1958 by Johnny O'Keefe.
</li><li> "Wild Thing" was written by Chip Taylor (brother of Jon Voight) and first recorded by the Wild Ones in 1965. A year later, the Troggs covered the song, it stormed to #1 on the charts, and the rest is history.
</li><li> "Wild in the Streets" is known by many younger people today as a song by Circle Jerks, but it was previously a small Seventies hit by Garland Jeffreys.
</li><li> "Wind Beneath My Wings" is most commonly associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetteMidler">Bette Midler</a>, who recorded it in 1989 for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beaches">Beaches</a></em>. The song, however, was written in 1982 by Jeff Silbar and Larry Henley and recorded by many artists before Midler including Roger Whittaker, Lou Rawls, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Lee Greenwood, and Gary Morris (whose version won Song of the Year at the Academy of Country Music awards in 1983, six years before Midler covered it - now he can't perform it in concert without someone complimenting his good job on "that Bette Midler song").
</li><li> The first recording of "Wishin' and Hopin'" was by Dionne Warwick in 1963, but by far more people are familiar with the cover released the following year by Dusty Springfield.
</li><li> "Without You" is possibly Harry Nilsson's greatest hit. Mariah Carey also famously performed it. Most people have probably never heard the original version by Badfinger. Of course, Nilsson dramatically re-arranged the song (the original is barely recognizable as the same tune); nearly every cover of the song since then (including Carey's version) is based on the Nilsson version.
</li><li> No, "Women in Uniform" is not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a> original. The Australian band Skyhooks wrote and recorded this song first.
</li><li> Cartoons' cover of "Witch Doctor" is starting to become more recognisable than the original by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">David Seville</a>, to the point where they are often mixed up for each over. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNYyrbACLs">This may be the case.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cameo">Cameo</a>'s 1986 funk standard "Word Up!" has been covered so many times people often can't even agree which cover they think is the original, be it the perky take by girlband Little Mix in 2014, the rock version by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn">Korn</a> in 2004 (or by Gun in 1994), or even the utterly bonkers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country &amp; Western</a> take by German band The Boss Hoss in 2005, which gained recognition after it appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheGoldenCircle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheGoldenCircle">Kingsman: The Golden Circle</a></em>.
</li><li> "Year 3000", made famous by Jonas Brothers in the US is a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">rather watered-down</a>) cover of a song by the defunct English boy band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Busted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Busted">Busted</a>.
</li><li> "Yes my Darling Daughter" (first introduced by Dinah Shore in 1940) uses the melody of "Oj ne khody Hrytsiu", an old Ukrainian murder ballad.Granted, the latter is probably much better known in Ukraine than the (much more cheerful) 1940's song.
</li><li> While it wasn't a big hit for either, Olivia Newton-John's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">cover</a> of "You Ain't Got the Right" is better-known than Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show's original version.
</li><li> "You Better Run" is a song from The Rascals but is better known nowadays for the cover version by Pat Benatar.
</li><li> "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" is a weird case. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarbraStreisand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarbraStreisand">Barbra Streisand</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond">Neil Diamond</a> both recorded and released their versions as obscure album tracks during the same timespan. A local radio DJ heard both recordings and, thinking there was something missing with both of them, spliced them both together (it helped that both versions were in the same key and tempo) and played the result on his show. The response was overwhelming enough for the song to be withdrawn from the show because there wasn't a single release of that particular version at the time. Eventually Streisand and Diamond were inspired to rerecord the song as a duet, which became a nationwide hit, so they sort of covered themselves up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlorenceAndTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlorenceAndTheMachine">Florence + the Machine</a>'s 2009 hit "You Got The Love" covered up the previous hit version by The Source, which in turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">Sampled Up</a> Candi Staton's original. Whether or not the Florence version is more well-known than the Florence/Dizzee Rascal version ("You Got The Dirtee Love") is debatable.
</li><li> Especially those who were young in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> might still believe that "You Keep Me Hangin' On" is originally by Kim Wilde. Actually, it's a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSupremes">The Supremes</a> and a rather loose cover because Kim Wilde couldn't exactly remember the original.
</li><li> Debby Boone's huge hit "You Light Up My Life" was originally performed by Kasey Cisyk for the film of the same name.
</li><li> Everybody and their uncle have probably heard Josh Groban singing "You Raise Me Up" (or if you're from Britain or Ireland, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife">Westlife</a>). Probably far fewer know that it was composed and performed by the Irish-Norwegian duo Secret Garden.
<ul><li> And the tune is a reworking of the Irish classic "Danny Boy" (or the Londonderry Air, for those Irish who don't care for those lyrics.)
</li></ul></li><li> Steve Goodman wrote "You Never Even Call Me By My Name" as a <em>parody</em> of country songs, though everyone today remembers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">hit country version</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidAllanCoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidAllanCoe">David Allan Coe</a>. In Coe's defense, he explicitly says that Goodman wrote the song in the spoken bit before the last verse, which breaks out all of the stops.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a> have been known to introduce "You Really Got Me" as a Van Halen song when performing it live.
</li><li> The cover of "You'll Never Walk Alone" by Gerry and the Pacemakers is far more well known than the original show tune from the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carousel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carousel">Carousel</a></em>. When Liverpool FC first used the song as a football anthem (as well as when other clubs later followed suit), the cover version was used instead of the original.
</li><li> Quite a few Brits think the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeathInParadise">Death in Paradise</a></em> is an original composition. Even people who know it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune">a preexisting song</a> called "You're Wondering Now" have no idea who originally performed it, usually crediting it to either the Skatalites, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSpecials">the Specials</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmyWinehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmyWinehouse">Amy Winehouse</a>. In reality, it was originally recorded in 1964 by obscure duo Andy &amp; Joey; <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxpeapFBNQ">here's their version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<p></p><ul><li> Five of the songs on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QueenOfTheDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QueenOfTheDamned">Queen of the Damned</a></em> soundtrack were written and recorded by Jonathan Davis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn">Korn</a>. Due to contract troubles, all five songs were covered for the official soundtrack, by the likes of Wayne Static, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">David Draiman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Chester Bennington</a> and Jay Gordon. Unless you've seen the movie (especially the music videos included as extras), most people think that the covers are in fact the original versions of the songs. And considering how hard it is to get a hold of the original versions, since they were never officially released, this doesn't look like it will change any time soon.
</li><li> In the days of early rock and roll, R&amp;B songs by black performers were not played on mainstream pop stations unless they were covered by white artists. However, this all changed in 1957, when a New York City disc jockey named Alan Freed invented a new type of music format called Top 40, which played all types and genres of music, as long as it was selling well.
<ul><li> Pat Boone was the most notorious of the "white cover" artists. Back in the day, his covers outsold the original versions by black musicians, but today the originals are seen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstAndForemost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstAndForemost">definitive</a> versions while Boone's versions are ridiculed.
</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to the proliferation of remixes and vocal arranges of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/Touhou">awesome library</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> music, numerous themes tend to get covered up from a fan's perspective.
<ul><li> For example, "UN Owen Was Her?!", Flandre Scarlet's theme, is often covered up by both hits like COOL&amp;CREATE's version... or even the Ronald remix known also as the McRoll. Even worse, another remix of the theme was uploaded under the name "John Stump - Death Waltz", became popular, and now you have people thinking that "U.N. Owen Was Her?" is a remix of Death Waltz, even though the real Death Waltz by John Stump is actually garbled nonsense.
</li><li> A more recent example would be "Bad Apple!!" - odds to evens you were thinking more of the Alstroemeria Records remix.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope has a life of its own in Asia. Many Mando-pop artists will take a hit foreign song (like Britney Spears's "Everytime," or Wild Cherry's "Play that Funky Music"), give it Mandarin lyrics and put it out.
</li><li> A high percentage of hits by Dominican "Merengue-hip-hop" bands from early to mid 90s (like Proyecto Uno, Ilegales, and Sandy y Papo) were in fact covers from hip-hop Anglo artists. This was made worse because many of the songs they covered were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One Hit Wonders</a> or specialists' hits in English, but those groups made these songs extremely popular and mainstream.
</li><li> There was an all-covers album called "Punk Goes Crunk," which featured various alternative music artists doing their own takes on various hip-hop and R songs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllTimeLow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AllTimeLow">All Time Low</a> did a cover version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s "Umbrella." Now, it's debateable whether All Time Low's or Rihanna's version is better known, though there are a sizable number of people who seem to think All Time Low's version was the original.
</li><li> This has occasionally happened in the trance genre. Ayla's "Liebe" and "Singularity" were remakes of Cosmic Baby's "Liebe" and Brainchild's "Symmetry", respectively. Kay Cee's "Escape" was based on 4 Voices' "Eternal Spirit".
<ul><li> Except for older ex-USSR inhabitants and Soviet cinema buffs, few people know that the core of "Resurrection" by trance duo PPK is actually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJj9y4t9UnU">a theme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Siberiade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Siberiade">Siberiade</a></em>, composed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EduardArtemyev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EduardArtemyev">Eduard Artemyev</a>. The film came out in 1979, thus predating trance music as such.
</li></ul></li><li> Kandystand's "Empty Rooms" and "Black Pearl", originally by Gary Moore and Sonny Charles &amp; The Checkmates, respectively.
</li><li> A*Teens and B3 were groups covering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees">The Bee Gees</a> respectively. Their versions were marketed at teenagers who, of course, didn't know squat about the original artists and believed that <em>these</em> highly successful versions were the originals. See also "How Deep Is Your Love" by Take That.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> provides an instrumental example with the leitmotif for Sideshow Bob. Although Bob did not have any theme music in his first few appearances, the episode "Cape Feare" provided him with a slightly altered version of the main theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapeFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapeFear">Cape Fear</a></em> as part of the episode's parody of the iconic film. The show continued to use the music in most of Bob's subsequent appearances. Over time, as <em>The Simpsons</em> continued to stay in the spotlight while <em>Cape Fear</em> faded into obscurity, many younger fans would know the song only as "Sideshow Bob's theme", not realizing that it was a homage to an older piece.
</li><li> The 1978 album <em>Dr. Heckle &amp; Mr. Jive</em> by England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley is notable for containing a Covered Up song (their version of "Love Is The Answer", originally written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToddRundgren">Todd Rundgren</a> and recorded by his band Utopia, was a Top 10 hit in the US) and two songs that went on to be Covered Up by other artists ("Broken-Hearted Me" by Anne Murray, "What's Forever For?" by Michael Martin Murphey).
</li><li> The evocative theme of the 1972 Solaris film is not composed by Eduard Artemyev, even though he performed it. It's a performance of a Bach piece, BWV 639.
</li><li> When people unfamiliar with Japanese culture hear the song <em>Inu no Omawari-san</em> (the policeman dog), they tend to call it the opening theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Frogger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Frogger">Frogger</a></em>. Said song has actually been around longer than the game, being a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in "10 FAMOUS SONGS You Didn&#146;t Know Were COVERS!" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MatthewSantoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MatthewSantoro">Matthew Santoro</a>, where Matthew talks about famous songs that, unbeknownst to most people, are actually cover songs.
</li><li> Something like unintentional covering up often happened in the 19th century. Romanticism was fashionable then, and lots of composers relied on folk tunes for inspiration - which unfortunately meant that whenever the author of the melody could not be established immediately, it was deemed to be folk tune. To their credit, the composers generally acknowledged the borrowing as soon as they learnt the identity of the true author, but by that time the tunes they used had been firmly covered up - to the point that the names of the original composers themselves are rather obscure nowadays. Examples include Sebasti&aacute;n Yradier, who wrote habanera "El Arreglito" later covered by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgesBizet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgesBizet">Georges Bizet</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen">Carmen</a></em>; B&eacute;la K&eacute;ler, who wrote a cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannesBrahms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannesBrahms">Johannes Brahms</a> as "Hungarian Dance No. 5"; Luigi Denza, whose "Funicul&igrave;, Funicul&agrave;" managed to be mistaken for a folk song <em>at least twice</em> - by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardStrauss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardStrauss">Richard Strauss</a> (whom Denza subsequently successfully sued) and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NikolaiRimski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NikolaiRimski">Nikolai Rimski</a>-Korsakov alike (though by now the original song is probably more well-known - if not its author).
</li><li> Perhaps the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">zigzagged</a> example ever is "Hard Times", a song by a group called The Jetzons that dates back to 1981, but was an unreleased track until <em>2009</em>. After the band broke up, however, their keyboardist, Brad Buxer, collaborated with a number of big-name artists, most frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>&mdash;including on that long-rumored but at-the-time unconfirmed uncredited contribution to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a></em> soundtrack, which features what is unmistakably an instrumental version of "Hard Times" as the theme for the Ice Cap Zone. (Asked about this, Buxer said that Jackson asked to be uncredited because he didn't want his name associated with the low quality of music that the Genesis could produce. Buxer was also credited on "Stranger In Moscow", the then-unreleased Jackson track that served as the game's credits theme. So to summarize, the most recognizable version of the song is an instrumental version in a 16-bit video game, essentially still by the original artist, 13 years after the song was originally written but 15 years before the original was ever released.
</li><li> Carl Orff's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana">Carmina Burana</a></em> is an interesting case which could arguably be considered this. The collection of 12th century poems, songs, and stories which Orff arranged as a symphonic cantata had little in the way of musical notation, and the notation which was used was so old that modern musical scholars aren't certain just how they would have been performed. As a result, Orff was free to arrange the music however he liked, and while he did make some attempt to work out the original arrangements, for the most part the 1936 work was an entirely original score.

</li><li> "Take Me Down" and "The Closer You Get" were first released by Exile. Both were hits for Alabama only a couple years before Exile reinvented itself, transforming from a one-hit wonder pop band to a successful country band.
<ul><li> Additionally for "The Closer You Get," two acoustic ballad versions were recorded, one by an obscure country artist named Don King (whose version hit the top 30 in the fall of 1981), the other by Kris Kristofferson's wife Rita Coolidge, who also released a version that did not reach the country charts but did make the top 20 of the Canadian adult contemporary charts. Alabama's country rock version, however, was the one that took hold.
</li></ul></li><li> "Touch Me When We're Dancing" was originally a pop and AC hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters">Carpenters</a>. And before that, by a Muscle Shoals band called Bama. Confused yet?
</li><li> Alabama had the original version of "I Want to Know You Before We Make Love," an album cut on their 1985 album <em>40 Hour Week</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a> released it as a single and reached No. 1 in the fall of 1987.

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Although Bach's works have often been Covered Up by other musicians, Bach himself Covers Up some older musical pieces.
<ul><li> The myriads of Lutheran church chorales used by Bach for his chorale cantatas and chorale preludes have often been misattributed to Bach, except probably <em>Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott</em>, a hymn by Martin Luther that is way too famous to be eclipsed by anything, even Bach's equally amazing chorale cantata based on that hymn.

<ul><li> "Anna (Go to Him)" , originally by Arthur Alexander.
</li><li> "Boys", by the Shirelles.
</li><li> "Chains", by the Cookies.
</li><li> "Devil in Her Heart", originally "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">Devil in His Heart</a>" by the Donays.

She took so long to record her version that the Beatles decided to record it themselves. While Franklin's version was released first, it was overshadowed by the Beatles' version, so they pretty much covered themselves up.

</li><li> "Drive South" which was first recorded by its writer, critically acclaimed singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and later covered by the Forester Sisters (whose version featured the Bellamy Brothers)
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> An alarming number of people think "Proud Mary" is a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TinaTurner">Tina Turner</a> rather than original band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, from their album <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BayouCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BayouCountry">Bayou Country</a></em>. It doesn't help much that John Fogerty has basically said she can keep it (his oily manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint">screwed him out the rights to all of Creedence's music</a>, so his lack of attachment to the song is understandable). Happily, the combination of Fogerty eventually regaining the royalties from his work with CCR and the band becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> means that even if it isn't quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstAndForemost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstAndForemost">First and Foremost</a>, the original recording of "Proud Mary" is certainly not forgotten, either.
<ul><li> Creedence themselves, meanwhile, did covers of the obscure blues numbers "Midnight Special" and "Suzie Q" that are far better known than the source songs.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelSilverstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShelSilverstein">Shel Silverstein</a> had already released his own version of "A Boy Named Sue" before Cash recorded it.
</li><li> "Folsom Prison Blues" was closely based on a Gordon Jenkins song called "Crescent City Blues"
</li><li> "I've Been Everywhere" is now thought of exclusively as a Johnny Cash song, but it has a complex history. It was written by Australian songwriter Geoff Mack in 1959, using Australian place names. Then his publisher gave him an atlas and asked him to write a version with American names. Hank Snow recorded that version in 1962, and it became a country music standard. When Cash recorded it in 1996, his younger fans weren't familiar with the song.
</li><li> "Ring of Fire" was first recorded by Anita Carter (June's sister).
</li><li> Nick Cave echoed Trent Reznor's sentiment when referring to Cave's "The Mercy Seat".
</li><li> "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down" was written by Kris Kristofferson and first recorded by, of all people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens">Ray Stevens</a>.

George S. Davis claims it was based on "Nine-to-ten tons", an earlier song of his.

However, the song was written in 1930 for the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonteCarlo1930" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonteCarlo1930">Monte Carlo</a>,</em> and it was one of star Jeanette MacDonald's signature pieces during her career.

</li><li> "Feelin' Alright", originally by Traffic.

</li><li> "You Are So Beautiful" was written and first recorded by Billy Preston.
</li><li> "You Can Leave Your Hat On" from the movie <em>9 1/2 Weeks</em>. The song was written, and first performed, by Randy Newman.

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks">Dixie Chicks</a>' singles:
<ul><li> "Some Days You Gotta Dance" by The Ranch (a short-lived band fronted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban">Keith Urban</a>; interestingly, Urban also played guitar on their version)
</li><li> "Cold Day in July" was originally a single by Joy Lynn White in the early 1990s. Suzy Bogguss also cut it.
</li><li> Sons of the Desert were the first act to record "Goodbye Earl", but a label dispute resulted in their version becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a>.
</li><li> This occurs with all four singles off <em>Home</em>: "Long Time Gone" is a cover of Darrell Scott; "Landslide" a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>; "Travelin' Soldier" a cover of Bruce Robison (Ty England also cut it in between); and "Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)" a cover of Radney Foster.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Probably half the Dropkick Murphys' songs sound like they're ditties passed down through generations. Of course, the fact that the other half of their songs <em>are</em> tunes passed down through generations (such as "Fields of Athenry" or "The Rocky Road to Dublin") doesn't help with clarity.
<ul><li> Except "Fields of Athenry" isn't a traditional song &mdash; it was written in the 1970s by Pete St. John, and most people know it from the Paddy Reilly cover, making it another example of this trope.
</li><li> The Dropkicks have also recorded a few otherwise unrecorded Woody Guthrie compositions, such as "Gonna Be A Blackout Tonight" and "I'm Shipping Up to Boston". They didn't write them, but they were the first to perform them, thus causing some confusion.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a>:
<ul><li> "Dog Day Sunrise" was not originally a song created by the band for their <em>Demanufacture</em> album. It was originally a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialMetal">Industrial Metal</a> band <em>Head of David</em>. <em>Obsolete</em> bonus track "0~0" also counts as it was originally made by another obscure band known as "Wiseblood".
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Obsolete</em>, the album features a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman">Gary Numan</a>'s iconic song "Cars". The cover featured Numan himself on it in a duet with frontman Burton C. Bell. However, the original is the only song Numan is really known for and is considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One-Hit Wonder</a>. The Fear Factory cover was responsible for breaking the band into the mainstream and is one of their most iconic songs along with "Replica", "Demanufacture", and "Linchpin". It is also the version that is often used in commercials and video game soundtracks, notably fitting in <em>Test Drive 5</em> and <em>Gran Turismo 2</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Would you believe that the background music from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Frogger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Frogger">Frogger</a></em> is an example of this? No, really: it's a cover of "Rock River E", the Japanese theme song from the 1970s anime <em>Rascal the Raccoon</em>. Frogger's opening theme is a rendition of Japanese children's song "Inu no Omawarisan" ("Dog Policeman"). Three other anime themes can be heard, although they're just snippets: "Oshiete" from Heidi, Girl of the Alps (the part being played is the second "yodeling" part), Hana no Ko Lunlun (from the show of the same name; split into two jingles), and "Ore wa Arthur" from Moero Arthur: Hakuba no Ouji. Later ports and remakes of the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReReleaseSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReReleaseSoundtrack">featured entirely new music</a>, presumably for this reason.
</li></ul><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FooFighters">Foo Fighters</a>, formed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DaveGrohl">Dave Grohl</a> of Nirvana, have also done more than their share of covers:
<ul><li> the most notable being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Paul McCartney's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BandOnTheRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BandOnTheRun">"Band On the Run"</a> (which escapes this trope, obviously)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "Have A Cigar" from ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere">Wish You Were Here</a>"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GerryRafferty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GerryRafferty">Gerry Rafferty</a>'s "Baker Street"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>'s "Darling Nikki"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaryNuman">Gary Numan</a>'s (or more accurately Tubeway Army's) "Down In The Park"
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Swedish revue actor and song writer usually used pre-existing foreign songs with his own Swedish-language lyrics. Because of how very popular he was, his new Swedish versions of foreign tunes almost always became more well-known and popular than the originals. While Karl Gerhard did have some skill as a music composer, his enormous talent for clever lyrics made it more convenient to simply cover somebody else's song and put all his energy on the text, where his true skills lay. A few examples, from a career that produced hundreds:
<ul><li> Gerhard's most popular song, "Jazzgossen," is based on the Danish tune "En liten rystedans." Nowadays, "En liten rystedans" is pretty much never mentioned except for as the basis of the Karl Gerhard song, which&mdash;unlike "En liten rystedans"&mdash;can be found on Wikipedia in multiple languages and on Spotify.
</li><li> Gerhard's "En katt bland hermelinerna" is based on the tune of the song "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", written by Bob Merrill and first performed by Guy Mitchell. The Swedish version is <em>very</em> different from the original, both in the lyrics and the musical arrangement. Feel free to compare <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqluWfoTD-8">the cover<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYeCwknuW_g">the original<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Gerhard's "Bom" was originally called "Boum" and sung by Charles Trenet. Trenet's version is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> at one point, to the enjoyment of Swedish moviegoers who never knew that there was a French version.

</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreatBigSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreatBigSea">Great Big Sea</a>:
<ul><li> "Beat The Dream" was originally a Runrig song called "Pride of the Summer".
</li><li> "Run Runaway" was first recorded by Slade.
</li><li> "When I'm Up (I Can't Get Down)", by Oysterband.
</li><li> Many Canadians forget that "End of the World (As we know it)" was originally done by, and is more commonly known in the rest of the world as performed by, REM.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HatsuneMiku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HatsuneMiku">Hatsune Miku</a>:
<ul><li> Slightly more extreme example: As noted above, Miku's cover of "Ievan Polkka" is better-known than both Loituma's cover and the cover it's covering, Holly Dolly's "Dolly Song (Ieva's Polkka)" as both feature similar instrumentals (though Holly's is slightly more upbeat) and the lyrics are a very particular section of the original.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> has an extensive library of songs and a <em>lot</em> of leitmotifs, so this has happened a few times.
<ul><li> The most obvious example is <a class="urllink" href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/black-2">Black<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which most don't realise is actually a cover of <a class="urllink" href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/liquid-negrocity">Liquid Negrocity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> More confusingly, for the album <a class="urllink" href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/alternia">Alternia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> there was a bonus song included called AlterniaBound. Later, on an <em>album</em> named AlterniaBound, this song was covered as <a class="urllink" href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/alternia">Alternia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a song which went on to become much, much more famous than the original.
</li><li> The track <a class="urllink" href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/megalovania">"MeGaLoVania"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TobyFox">Toby Fox</a>'s self-cover of a song of the same name (sans the other 4 capitals) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHalloweenHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHalloweenHack">The Halloween Hack</a></em>. As <em>Homestuck</em> was wildly popular at the time and Toby's music for it then more widely known than his previous notoriety in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> community, the association stuck. Eventually, it too was covered by its use in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, with the association going to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sans</span> more than the character's own theme.
</li></ul></li><li> The Horrors, in their early days, tended to cover quite a few garage songs.
<ul><li> Screaming Lord Sutch's "Jack the Ripper"
</li><li> The Syndicats' "Crawdaddy Simone"
</li><li> Both "Count in Fives" and "A Knife in Their Eye" are partial examples; "Fives" underwent some controversy from the similarity of the intro and verse to "My Brother, The Man" by We The People, while "A Knife in Their Eye" has original lyrics by Horrors frontman Faris Badwan set to music by The Monks.
</li><li> Aside from garage, the Horrors pay tribute to '70s electronic duo Suicide with the "Shadazz" half of the <em>Shadazz/Radiation</em> split EP, and in the encore of their sets in 2009 with "Ghost Rider".
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a>:
<ul><li> "It Must Be Love" was a hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams">Don Williams</a> about 30 years before Alan Jackson's cover. Both versions went to #1. "It Must Be Love", along with the below-mentioned "Pop a Top" and "The Blues Man" were from a covers album.
</li><li> "Mercury Blues" (y'know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming">Crazy 'bout a Mercury</a>?) is a cover of a 1949 song by K.C. Douglas, and was originally called "Mercury Boogie". It's also been covered by the Steve Miller Band and Meat Loaf. Also by David Lindley, the version which appeared in an episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiamiVice">Miami Vice</a>.
</li><li> "Murder on Music Row," his duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a>, was first recorded by Larry Cordle.
</li><li> "Pop a Top" was a hit for Jim Ed Brown in the 1960s.
</li><li> "Song for the Life" was first recorded by its writer, Rodney Crowell, and had been recorded by at least five other artists before Alan released his version.
</li><li> "Summertime Blues" was first released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EddieCochran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EddieCochran">Eddie Cochran</a>. It was also covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a> (who covered The Who's version), and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueCheer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueCheer">Blue Cheer</a> (#14 in 1968).
</li><li> "Tall, Tall Trees" was co-written by Roger Miller and George Jones, both of whom recorded their own versions in the 1960s.
</li><li> "The Blues Man" was an album track by Hank Williams, Jr.
</li><li> "Who's Cheatin' Who" was a #1 hit for country singer Charly McClain in 1981.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Sonny James, known as "the Southern Gentleman," recorded many covers of hits that became widely known to country artists and &mdash; in more than one instance &mdash; became the definitive version, either overall or in the country genre. Examples:
<ul><li> "Young Love," his first No. 1 hit (from 1957) on both the country and pop charts. Today, it's still his signature song, and the original version by 1950s pop balladeer Tab Hunter is forgotten.
</li><li> "Take Good Care of Her," originally a top 10 pop and top 20 R&amp;B hit in 1961 by singer Adam Wade. Sonny took this tale of bidding the object of his unrequited love well on her wedding day to No. 1 in the late spring of 1966.
</li><li> Two of Sonny's No. 1 hits during his run of 16 straight (from 1967-1971) were covers of The Seekers hits, including "I'll Never Find Another You" (four weeks in August 1967) and "A World Of Our Own" (three weeks in March 1968).
</li><li> "Born To Be With You," a top 5 pop hit by The Chordettes in 1956, became a No. 1 country smash for Sonny in 1968. By now, Sonny's streak was at six, putting him alone in second place for most No. 1 songs in as many single releases behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuckOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuckOwens">Buck Owens</a>. His hit train, however, was just picking up steam ... .
</li><li> 1969 saw him really hit his peak, as all three of his single releases were covers ... and all three went No. 1, running his streak to nine. The songs that made his streak now starting to rival labelmate Buck's:
<ul><li> "Only The Lonely," covering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s No. 2 pop hit from 1960.
</li><li> "Running Bear," the remake of Johnny Preston's 1960 No. 1 hit. (The Preston original, BTW, included backing vocals by an uncredited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a>).
</li><li> Perhaps his signature country hit other than "Young Love" &mdash; "Since I Met You Baby," a faux-live cover of the 1956 R&amp;B hit by Ivory Joe Hunter that spent three weeks at No. 1 that October.
</li></ul></li><li> And 1970, three of his four No. 1 hits were covers:
<ul><li> Book-ending 1970 were covers of two Brook Benton R&amp;B classics: "It's Just a Matter Of Time" (from February, four weeks) and "Endlessly" (three weeks in December). The former, BTW, has been covered up itself, but Sonny didn't mind one bit that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyTravis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyTravis">Randy Travis</a> with his December 1989 No. 1 hit.
</li><li> Following up "... Time" was a cover of Petula Clark's then 4-year-old hit "My Love." James spent three weeks at No. 1 in May, denied a longer stay due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a>'s "Hello Darlin'."
</li></ul></li><li> 1971 saw Sonny return to the Ivory Joe Hunter catalog for "Empty Arms," the Southern Gentleman's last multi-week No. 1 hit, peaking in April and May. Later in 1971, Sonny tied Buck Owens' then-standing record of 15 No. 1 songs in a row with "Bright Lights, Big City," a 10-year-old blues tune by Jimmy Reed. (The song that set the new record of 16 in a row, "Here Comes Honey Again," was a Sonny original.)
</li><li> 1972 ... the song that interrupted the streak was "Only Love Can Break a Heart," covering Gene Pitney's 1962 hit that also peaked at No. 2 (only on the pop chart). Later in the year:
<ul><li> Sonny covered <em>himself</em> up in June, returning to No. 1 with a re-recording of "That's Why I Love You Like I Do." That remake, BTW, was the retitled "You're the Reason I'm In Love," the B-side to "Young Love."
</li><li> "When the Snow Is On The Roses," his first hit for Columbia Records, a cover of a No. 1 adult contemporary hit by Ed Ames from 1967. This became his 22nd No. 1 hit in September.
</li><li> "White Silver Sands," a No. 3 from December that had originally been a hit the Bill Black Combo in 1960.
</li></ul></li><li> 1974 brought Sonny's final No. 1 hit, "Is It Wrong For Loving You," written and recorded (and became a top 10 country hit in 1957) by Warner Mack.
</li><li> 1975 saw Sonny unearth another old favorite, a James Gilreath hit called "Little Band Of Gold." Sonny's version - complete with horn section - was a top 5 country hit early that summer.
</li><li> 1976 brought an album of old standards and folk songs, including early country music songs. Included was a top 15 hit, "The Prisoner's Song," a modernized version of the 1925 hit by Vernon Dalhart.
</li><li> 1977 brought Sonny into the top 20 once again with two more remakes: "In the Jailhouse Now" (covering an original Jimmie Rodgers composition that was far-better known by Webb Pierce) and "Abeline" (a No. 1 country hit by former teen idol and later country music mainstay George Hamilton IV).
</li></ul></li><li> Ronan Keating:
<ul><li> "If Tomorrow Never Comes" previously a #1 hit for Garth Brooks.
</li><li> "The Long Goodbye" is a curious one: Ronan Keating and Paul Brady co-wrote it for Brady's album <em>Oh What a World</em> and it was the lead single off that album; a year before Brooks &amp; Dunn covered it. Ronan then claimed it back two years after <em>that</em>, his version being the best known in the UK.
</li><li> As mentioned, "When You Say Nothing At All" by Keith Whitley, then Alison Krauss.
</li><li> "We've Got Tonight", originally by Bob Seger (whose version was itself covered up by Kenny Rogers and Sheena Easton).
</li><li> "She Believes in Me", a number 1 hit for Kenny Rogers.
</li><li> "I Hope You Dance", originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeAnnWomack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeAnnWomack">Lee Ann Womack</a>.
</li><li> "Father and Son", originally by Cat Stevens, who appears on the cover under his current name, Yusuf Islam.
</li></ul></li><li> Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips have been on both ends, with covered up versions of their originals (or other songs they've recorded popularized by someone else) and cover versions that they became famously associated with:
<ul><li> "I Heard It Through the Grapevine," more famously by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarvinGaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and given a critically acclaimed swamp rock arrangement by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>. Fewer people remember the Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips original, even though it was a No. 2 hit and extensively played in 1968.
</li><li> "Midnight Train to Georgia," originally recorded and became a minor hit by Cissy Houston (mother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a>) a year earlier.
</li><li> Two of the group's biggest hits during their 1970s hot streak were covers of country songs, both written by Jim Weatherly. In the spring of 1973, they had the pop and R&amp;B version of "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be the First To Say Goodbye)," which concurrently was a top 5 country hit for Bob Luman. In the fall of 1973, legendary country singer Ray Price recorded "You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me," which became a No. 1 hit; a few months later, Gladys and her Pips recorded a cover of the song (dropping "Your the ..." part from the title), taking it it to No. 3 on the pop charts and No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart. Depending on the genre, however, both Pips' version or the country originals remain equally famous.
</li></ul></li><li> Kirsty MacColl: Although an acclaimed songwriter in her own right, two of her biggest hits were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> versions: "A New England", originally by Billy Bragg, and to a lesser extent "Days", originally by The Kinks. Her own song "They Don't Know" was in turn covered up by Tracey Ullman - MacColl actually sang backup vocals on the Ullman version.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness">Madness</a>:
<ul><li> "One Step Beyond" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneStepBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneStepBeyond">One Step Beyond</a></em>, originally by Prince Buster.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, "It Must Be Love" by Labi Siffre. More people know it as a Madness song, but the original still gets its share of airplay.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Siw Malmkvist has covered lots of American pop classics in Swedish, and in Sweden her covers definitely were more famous than the American covers when they first came out, and sometimes remain so to this day.
<ul><li> <em>Everybody's Somebody's Fool</em> was turned into *Tunna skivor.''
</li><li> <em>Ode to Billie Joe</em> became <em>Jon Andreas visa</em>.
</li><li> <em>Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head</em> became <em>Regnet det bara &ouml;ser ner</em>.

<ul><li> Both "Love at the Five and Dime" and "Goin' Gone" were originally recorded by Nanci Griffith.
</li><li> "Come from the Heart" and "Standing Knee Deep in a River (Dying of Thirst)" were both originally recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DonWilliams">Don Williams</a>.
</li><li> "Lonesome Standard Time" was originally recorded by Larry Cordle.
</li><li> "Untold Stories" and "Walk the Way the Wind Blows" were both originally recorded by Hot Rize.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartinaMcBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartinaMcBride">Martina McBride</a>:
<ul><li> "My Baby Loves Me" was released in Canada by Patricia Conroy one year prior to Martina's version.
</li><li> "Safe in the Arms of Love". Originally recorded by Gail Davies' side project Wild Choir in 1986, followed by Baillie &amp; the Boys in 1989 and Kennedy Rose<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6xdut');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6xdut" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6xdut');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mary Ann Kennedy and Pam Rose, who wrote the song with Pat Bunch</span> in 1994. Then in 1995, Martina McBride released a successful version in the US, while Michelle Wright did likewise in Canada.
</li><li> "Swingin' Doors" was originally released by Molly &amp; the Heymakers in 1992.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebaMcEntire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebaMcEntire">Reba McEntire</a>:
<ul><li> "You Lie" and "Waitin' for the Deal to Go Down", two cuts from her 1990 album <em>Rumor Has It</em>, were both previously cut by Cee Cee Chapman in 1988. Reba released "You Lie" as a single, but "Waitin'..." became a double example when Dixiana covered her version a year later.
</li><li> "Fancy" was written and recorded by Bobbie Gentry in 1969.
</li><li> "The Night The Lights Went Out in Georgia" was originally recorded by Vicki Lawrence.
</li><li> "Somebody" was originally cut by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkWills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkWills">Mark Wills</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> made numerous covers and many of those Covered Up the original, most notably:
<ul><li> "Breadfan" and "Crash Course In Brain Surgery" originally by Budgie
</li><li> "Am I Evil", "Helpless", and "The Prince" originally by Diamond Head
</li><li> "So What?" originally by Anti-Nowhere League
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Achieved twice by Nazareth:
<ul><li> "This Flight Tonight", by Joni Mitchell
</li><li> "Love Hurts", as mentioned above.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Nirvana's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MTVUnpluggedInNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MTVUnpluggedInNewYork">MTV Unplugged in New York</a></em> live album is also subject to this, as many people are apparently unaware that many of the songs are covers of anything from David Bowie tunes to old Christian standards... <em>despite the fact that Kurt Cobain says so on the album itself</em>.
<ul><li> "Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam"; Kurt Cobain jokingly introduces it a "rendition of an old Christian song, I think [...] but we do it the Vaselines way". It's not. It's an original song by the Vaselines that <em>parodies</em> an old Christian song called "I'll Be a Sunbeam".
</li><li> Nirvana also covered up Devo's "Turn Around" - the fact that the original was a rare b-side to begin with probably doesn't help (although it's available on iTunes now).
</li><li> Nirvana were prone to covering a lot of songs by the same artist. Examples include The Wipers' "Return of the Rat" and "D-7" as well as The Vaselines' "Molly's Lips", "Son of a Gun" (both available on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Incesticide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Incesticide">Incesticide</a></em>, and the above mentioned "Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam". In an interesting take, Nirvana covered folk songs most famously played by Lead Belly but changed the titles to match the chorus ("In The Pines" became "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" and "He Never Said A Mumbling Word" became "They Hung Him On A Cross"). Nirvana's first single was also a cover being the song "Love Buzz" originally performed by Shocking Blue in 1969.

<ul><li> As mentioned below, "Operator, Operator" is a cover of Larry Willoughby.
</li><li> "I'm Gonna Get You" is a Billy Swan cover.
</li><li> "Joe Knows How to Live" is a cover of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
</li><li> "In a Letter to You" is a Shakin' Stevens cover.
</li><li> "Sooner or Later" is a cover of the Forester Sisters.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Brazilian late female singer Elis Regina has at least two:
<ul><li> &#147;Como nossos pais&#148; (translated as "just like our parents") was written and first recorded by Belchior in 1976, being recorded by Elis later in the same year. Elis&#146; rendition became much better known than his. Her intense, striking performance, either in studio or live, made it one of the songs most associated to her. Many of the covers that came after tend to be based on her rendition. The actresses/singers who play her in biopics or theater plays mostly <em>have</em> to sing this song.
</li><li> &#147;O B&ecirc;bado e a equilibrista&#148; ("The drunk man and the female tightrope walker") was written (with co-author Aldir Blanc) and first recorded by Jo&atilde;o Bosco in 1979, being recorded by Elis later in the same year and since then became strongly associated to her. Curiously, its mood is the opposite of the one from &#147;Como Nossos Pais&#148;, both in lyrics and in Elis&#146; performance&#150; while the 1976&#146;s song was aggressive and pessimistic, the 1979&#146;s song was calm and optimistic, mostly because both songs reflected the writers&#146; (and Elis&#146;) mood about Brazilian political context, which was better in 1979 than in 1976. Her intensity was nearly the same (as in most or all of her performances), but <em>the way this intensity manifested</em> changed accordingly.

<ul><li> "Black Magic Woman" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Abraxas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Abraxas">Abraxas</a></em>) was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a> song. Peter Green himself told Carlos Santana he wanted to hear him and his band play it. It ended up becoming the big hit for Santana that Fleetwood Mac would have loved to have.
</li><li> "Evil Ways" was first recorded by Willie Bobo.
</li><li> "Oye Como Va" by Tito Puente.
</li><li> "Jingo" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BabatundeOlatunji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BabatundeOlatunji">Babatunde Olatunji</a> (originally from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrumsOfPassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrumsOfPassion">Drums of Passion</a></em>)

</li><li> "All These Years" was first recorded by Mac McAnally, a frequent writing partner of lead singer Mark Miller.
</li><li> In 1997, the group had two: "Six Days on the Road," a No. 2 hit for Dave Dudley from 1963; and "This Night Won't Last Forever," a top 15 pop hit for Michael Johnson (who would later turn country) in 1979.

</li><li> The "extra life" theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrDo">Mr. Do!</a> is in fact the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>.
</li><li> A video game called <em>Domino Man</em> used Scott Joplin's ragtime song "Maple Leaf Rag".
</li><li> The main gameplay theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gyruss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gyruss">Gyruss</a></em> may sound pretty cool, but you may be surprised to know that it's an electronic rendition of a classical composition called "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" by Johann Sebastian Bach (and classical music typically isn't thought of as "cool"...). And wouldn't you know it, musicologists are now predominantly of the opinion that even this wasn't an original composition, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Bach's transcription from a version for string instrument by an unknown author</a>. The "Toccata and Fugue" (well, the toccata part, anyway) is the most well known organ piece out there, and has been appropriated in this way ever since cinemas got organs.
</li><li> The arcade game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BombJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BombJack">Bomb Jack</a></em> uses the first ending theme of "Spoon Obaasan" (based on the classic book "Mrs. Pepperpot") was used as the first level theme. The second level theme is "Lady Madonna", one of the Beatles' number one hits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phoenix">Phoenix</a></em>, for its intro, uses that Spanish-guitar classical piece "Romance de Amor". For the second and subsequent waves, the intro is Beethoven's "F&uuml;r Elise".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowIslands">Rainbow Islands</a></em> uses <em>Somewhere Over The Rainbow</em> as its main theme. Clever. Similarly, its sequel <em>Parasol Stars</em> uses the <em>Lambada</em> as the boss BGM!

Most people who have heard the song associate it far more strongly with <em>Darius</em> than with MSI.
</li><li> Most people don't realize that the main theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lemmings">Lemmings</a></em> is actually a chiptune rendition of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainSoundtrack">public-domain</a> song, "March of the Mods".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>: the "Master Sounds" radio station from <em>San Andreas</em> is apparently a conscious attempt by the developers to reverse this trend &mdash; it plays only songs which later became vastly more famous when they were covered or sampled by more popular artists.

<ul><li> The Air on the G String is actually the Air from Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major. Violinist August Wilhelmj transposed and rewrote the Air in C Major in order to play it solely on the G string of the violin. Most recordings now list the work as the Air on the G String, even if the recording is of the original Orchestral Suite version.
</li><li> "Sheep may safely graze" is the most famous movement of Bach's secular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WasMirBehagtIstNurDieMuntreJagd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WasMirBehagtIstNurDieMuntreJagd">Hunting Cantata</a></em>. In fact, the rest of the cantata remains obscure outside the realm of Bach fans and music scholars, while "Sheep may safely graze" is almost universally known. Even the original version of the movement is obscure, with its many arrangements taking the spotlight. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sG5W48EDBw">Link to original "Sheep may safely graze"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

What many people don't know is that the lyrics are <em>not</em> translated from Bach's originals. That's right, original<strong>s</strong>. The melody for <em>Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring</em> actually comes from the <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/7jh-riSkA2A?t=14m52s">sixth<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/7jh-riSkA2A?t=24m46s">tenth<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> movements of the cantata <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herz_und_Mund_und_Tat_und_Leben,_BWV_147">Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> (Heart and Mouth and Deed and Life).

To top all this off, the melodies of the two original movements in question are themselves arrangements of a Lutheran chorale which Bach himself Covered Up.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> are believed to be the most covered artist in history ("Yesterday" alone supposedly has <em>thousands</em> of cover versions), and it's a testament to their artistry that for nearly all of their songs, the original versions remain the most famous versions. One notable exception, however: Joe Cocker's version of "With a Little Help from My Friends" became so iconic (helped by having been used as the theme song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears">The Wonder Years</a></em>) that few realize it's a Beatles song at all, let alone that it was another song from <em>Sgt Pepper</em>. Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AcrossTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AcrossTheUniverse">Across the Universe</a></em>, which generally stuck pretty closely to the Beatles' arrangements of songs, made that one roughly 50/50 Beatles/Cocker.
<ul><li> A few exceptions of Lennon-McCartney compositions include covers done by, ironically enough, country artists. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnneMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnneMurray">Anne Murray</a>'s "You Won't See Me" was a top 10 pop hit (as the second side of the double-A'ed "He Thinks I Still Care," itself a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a>), and Rosanne Cash's 1989 hit "I Don't Want To Spoil the Party." Cash's hit was, by the way, the only time a Lennon-McCartney song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeeGees">The Bee Gees</a> penned a few hits for others:
<ul><li> "Rest Your Love on Me", written by Barry Gibb, was an obscure B-side for the Bee Gees. Conway Twitty covered it and took it to #1 on the country charts.
</li><li> Likewise, Yvonne Elliman's smash "If I Can't Have You" was another obscure B-side for the Bee Gees.
</li><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20403_6-famous-songs-written-by-last-person-youd-expect_p2.html">6 Famous Songs Written by the Last Person You'd Expect<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is "Islands in the Stream."

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Bonnie Tyler's 1988 album <em>Hide Your Heart</em> alone had several songs recorded more famously by other artists later on:
<ul><li> The title track "Hide Your Heart" was originally recorded by her, but covered by FOUR other artists the very next year - Ace Frehley, Robin Beck, Molly Hatchet, and (most famously) KISS.
</li><li> "Save Up All Your Tears" is best known as a Robin Beck song in continental Europe, and as a Cher song everywhere else - but it was first recorded by Bonnie on the same album.
</li><li> "The Best" became a hit for Tina Turner when she covered it one year after Bonnie's original recording.
</li><li> Separately, her own biggest hit, 1983's "Total Eclipse of the Heart," was briefly overshadowed in the 1990s by a very successful dance cover by Nicki French. Nowadays French's version is mostly forgotten, however.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Eddie Cochran was one of the great pioneers of rock. During his tragically short carreer he had several hits, many of which have been Covered Up by others. Cochran even used to be erroneously described on this very page as a "one-hit wonder".
<ul><li> "C'mon Everybody" by Led Zeppelin and Sid Vicious amongst many others, but the version best known in the UK is probably the John Lydon version.
</li><li> "Somethin' Else", Led Zeppelin and Sid Vicious again &mdash; amongst many others, again.
</li><li> "Summertime Blues" by Alan Jackson (see also the by covering musician list). Those who aren't country music fans will probably be more familiar with The Who's version, or even the Blue Cheer version.
</li><li> "Three Steps to Heaven" by Showaddywaddy.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartinDenny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartinDenny">Martin Denny</a> is an intresting example.

<ul><li> He had also made a song called "Firecraker" on the same album, which was covered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YellowMagicOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YellowMagicOrchestra">Yellow Magic Orchestra</a>'s first big hit.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode">Depeche Mode</a>:

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond">Neil Diamond</a> started out as a songwriter so a lot of his music has been recorded by other singers:
<ul><li> "Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon" has been covered numerous times, but was only covered up at the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em>, which featured Urge Overkill's rendition. Still, Neil Diamond's original is not entirely forgotten.
</li><li> The first and definitive version of "I'm A Believer" was released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a> (Diamond actually recorded his own version first but it wasn't released until later). The same was the case for three other Monkees hits: "Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)", "Love to Love" and "A little Bit Me, A Little Bit You". "I'm a Believer" has since been covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth">Smash Mouth</a> (for the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em>, giving the song a significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevivalByCommercialization">Revival by Commercialization</a> in the process) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a>.
</li><li> "Red Red Wine" first covered by Tony Tribe and then in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> by UB40, with UB40's version regaining popularity nearly 20 years after it was released. Neil Diamond later recorded a new version inspired by UB40's cover.
</li><li> "Solitary Man" was Diamond's first hit (#55 pop) in 1966. It's been covered by Jay and the Americans, Chris Isaak, T.G. Sheppard (#14 country, #100 pop in 1976), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a>, and H.I.M.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits">Dire Straits</a> have been covered many times by country artists:
<ul><li> John Anderson covered "When It Comes to You" from their album <em>On Every Street</em>, and took his version to #3 on the country charts in 1992. Anderson's version features Mark Knopfler on lead guitar.
</li><li> Mary Chapin Carpenter covered "The Bug", from the same album, a year later, and had a minor country hit with it as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJudds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJudds">The Judds</a> covered one of their earliest songs, "Water Of Love".
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Fefe Dobson wrote songs for an unreleased second album in 2007.

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> is possibly this trope's biggest victim, which has been joked about, as in the video <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1156305/no_direction_period/">No Direction, Period<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, wherein it is "revealed" that, unbeknownst to the public at large, every popular song of the last 35 years was attributable to Bob Dylan. (Conversely, on spoof news comedy <em>The Day Today</em>, many of Dylan's hits are "revealed" to have been written by British Ukelele player George Formby in the 1940s; "Dylan, who is in hospital after eating a rotten wolf, has been unavailable for comment".)
<ul><li> Even though Dylan sang "All Along the Watchtower" more often than any other song he wrote, plenty of people still think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> did it first. The confusion isn't helped any by Dylan saying that's how the song should have been played to start with, nor by Dylan altering his playing to be closer to the Hendrix version after Jimi died. Dylan himself wrote about Hendrix covering "Watchtower" in the liner notes of his <em>Biograph</em> box set:
<div class="indent"> "It's not a wonder to me that he did my songs; rather, that he did so few, because they were all his."
</div></li><li> "Blowin' In The Wind" (Peter, Paul, and Mary); "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "My Back Pages" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a>); "It Ain't Me Babe" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTurtles">The Turtles</a>) and "Desolation Row" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a>).
</li><li> "Knockin' On Heaven's Door", which some thought was originally by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a>.
</li><li> And "Make You Feel My Love," which has become something of a hit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adele">Adele</a> (not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks">Garth Brooks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>)&mdash;and proved that Dylan's 90's repertoire is as ripe for pilfering as his older stuff. In fact, though Bob Dylan wrote the song, the first version released commercially was actually by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> (under the title "To Make You Feel My Love").
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Radney Foster had this happen several times:
<ul><li> Three tracks off his <em>See What You Want to See</em> album were made more famous by other artists, and two of those happened to be by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban">Keith Urban</a>. He covered "Raining on Sunday" in 2003, and "I'm In" seven years later. ("I'm In" was also cut by The Kinleys in between.) The third was "Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)", covered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks">Dixie Chicks</a> also in 2003.

</li><li> "Once Bitten, Twice Shy" by Great White.
</li><li> "Ships" by Barry Manilow.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Marcus Hummon had two tracks covered from his debut album <em>All in Good Time</em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a> took "One of These Days" in 1998, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts">Rascal Flatts</a> covered "Bless the Broken Road" in 2004 (although Melodie Crittenden also released a version in between &mdash; and strangely, she recorded another version with Christian group Selah in 2006 based on the success of the Rascal Flatts version).
</li></ul><ul><li> Mac McAnally:
<ul><li> Pretty much every track on his 1989 album <em>Simple Life</em> has been recorded by at least one other artist. Among those that were singles for someone else:
<ul><li> "Company Time" by Linda Davis in 1994.
</li><li> "Southbound" by Sammy Kershaw in 1995.
</li><li> A rather strange example is "Back Where I Come From". Mac's version made #14 on the country charts in 1990. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney">Kenny Chesney</a> recorded it for his 1996 album <em>Me and You</em> but did not release it as a single, included a live version on his first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits Album</a> five years later, and regularly sings the song in concert. Although Kenny never released it as a single, many radio stations play either of his versions while shunning Mac's.
</li><li> Chesney also released a cover of "Down the Road" (which Mac originally recorded on that album and later included on <em>Knots</em>) in 2008, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">had Mac sing and play guitar on it</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mac also recorded "All These Years" on his album <em>Live and Learn</em> a few months before Sawyer Brown covered it.

</li><li> "You've Always Got Me": Later an album track for Aaron Tippin.

<ul><li> "Hard to Handle" by Black Crowes. This is especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">head-screwy</a> if you don't know it's a cover and you watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyraBreckinridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyraBreckinridge">Myra Breckinridge</a></em>, in which (a very old) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeWest">Mae West</a> of all people sings it.
</li><li> "I Can't Turn You Loose" is more well known as the chase theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBluesBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBluesBrothers">The Blues Brothers</a></em>. There are people who don't realize that the song has lyrics (or that the Blues Brothers song is actually a medley of "I Can't Turn You Loose" and "Time is Tight" by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s.)
</li><li> "Respect" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin">Aretha Franklin</a>. Since Aretha's version has become iconic as a theme for empowered women, it's ironic that the song was written <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheGender">from a man's point of view</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Bruce Robison:

</li><li> "Travelin' Soldier" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks">Dixie Chicks</a> (although Ty England also recorded it in between). Bruce's sister-in-law, Emily Robison, happens to be one-third of the Dixie Chicks.

<ul><li> There's probably plenty of people who think Kurt Cobain wrote "Love Buzz".
</li><li> "Venus" is possibly more famous in its cover version by Bananarama, although both versions were hits.

<ul><li> Not a true covered-up, as Patti co-wrote the song with Bruce (he wrote the music but couldn't come up with lyrics, so he gave it to her to finish).
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CatStevens">Cat Stevens</a>:

</li><li> "Wild World" by Jimmy Cliff, and in some circles by Mark Cohn.
</li><li> "Here Comes my Baby" by Sons of Admirals (at least in the Youtube community)
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Sonny Throckmorton wrote several songs for other artists from the 1970s to the 1990s, but four of his songs were covered up by someone else within a year:
<ul><li> "I Wish You Could Have Turned My Head (And Left My Heart Alone)" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOakRidgeBoys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a>
</li><li> "Smooth Sailin'" and "Last Cheater's Waltz", which Sonny released as a double-A-side. Both were covered up by T.G. Sheppard.
</li><li> "Friday Night Blues" by John Conlee
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Allen Toussaint
<ul><li> Better known as a producer and songwriter, the New Orleans legend has had three of his songs as a performer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a>:
<ul><li> "Java", recorded as Al Tousan in 1958, became a Top 10 hit for Al Hirt in 1964.
</li><li> "Whipped Cream", which Toussaint wrote and recorded with his band The Stokes in 1964 (partly to capitalize on "Java"'s success) became the title track of Herb Alpert's hugely popular <em>Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights</em> album the next year, in a note-for-note cover.
</li><li> The title track of Toussaint's 1975 album <em>Southern Nights</em> became a #1 hit for Glen Campbell two years later (in a radically different arrangement).
</li><li> Interestingly, Hirt's "Java" and Alpert's "Whipped Cream" are both better known now for being used by others: "Java" in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">Muppet</a> sketch, "Whipped Cream" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDatingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDatingGame">The Dating Game</a></em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomWaits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomWaits">Tom Waits</a>:
<ul><li> A cover of "Downtown Train" (originally recorded for Waits' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RainDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RainDogs">Rain Dogs</a></em> album) by Rod Stewart in 1989 made it to #3 on the American pop charts, making it the highest charting version of a Waits song ever (Waits himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder">has no charting singles</a>). Bob Seger also recorded a cover that same year, but was not released until 2011 because Stewart's became a big hit.
</li><li> Rod Stewart also covered Waits' "Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda)" (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmallChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmallChange">Small Change</a></em>) for his <em>Unplugged</em> album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a> covered "I Don't Wanna Grow Up", originally on Waits' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoneMachine">Bone Machine</a></em>, and Waits has since covered two of the Ramones' songs.
</li><li> "Jersey Girl" was originally written for Waits' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeartattackAndVine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeartattackAndVine">Heartattack and Vine</a></em>, but most people know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> cover.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEagles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEagles">The Eagles</a> covered "Ol' '55".
</li><li> Thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>, the Blind Boys of Alabama's version of "Way Down in the Hole" is now at least as famous as the Waits original... And it might even be better. The Waits version was used as the theme in Season 2, but the Blind Boys' was the theme in Season 1 and also played over a montage at the end of the final episode.
</li><li> Then there is the matter of "Whistlin' Past the Graveyard", which was written by Waits, but was intentionally supposed to sound like it was written and performed in the manner of Screamin' Jay Hawkins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAdaptation">Then Hawkins covered it</a>, and that version was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong">used in a commercial</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Two tracks on Bryan White's debut album were covered by other artists: "Nothing Less Than Love" by The Buffalo Club, and "Going, Going, Gone" by Neal McCoy.
</li></ul><ul><li> Trent Willmon has two Covered Up songs, both on his <em>Broken In</em> album:
<ul><li> "The Truth" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonAldean">Jason Aldean</a>
</li><li> "There Is a God" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeAnnWomack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeeAnnWomack">Lee Ann Womack</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TearsForFears">Tears for Fears</a> have their fair share of covered songs
<ul><li> "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" was covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">Lorde</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesCatchingFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesCatchingFire">The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</a>.</em>
</li><li> "Mad World" was famously covered by Gary Jules for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em>.
</li><li> And multiple artists have covered "Shout", such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert">Adam Lambert</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Disturbed">Disturbed</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Larry Willoughby (cousin of Rodney Crowell) had this happen with two of his three singles. "Operator, Operator" was covered by Eddy Raven, and "Building Bridges" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a> (Nicolette Larson also had a version).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RandyNewman">Randy Newman</a> started as a songwriter and essentially never stopped, even when he started recording. Notable examples include "You Can Leave Your Hat On", "I Think It's Going to Rain Today", "Mama Told Me Not to Come", and "Louisiana 1927" (a charity single by Aaron Neville after Katrina). Three Dog Night in particular loved covering his songs.
</li></ul><ul><li> Curtis Wright's late-1989 debut single "She's Got a Man on Her Mind" was released in 1991 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a>, whose version was Twitty's last Top 40 hit. In 1992, Wright released his self-titled debut album, from which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClayWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClayWalker">Clay Walker</a> took "What's It to You", his chart-topping debut single. (Both Wright's and Walker's version even had the same producer.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne">Avril Lavigne</a> had a hand in writing at least three songs that became famous for versions sung by other artists: "Breakaway", sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>, "I Will Be" sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonaLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonaLewis">Leona Lewis</a> and "Dancing Crazy", sung by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MirandaCosgrove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MirandaCosgrove">Miranda Cosgrove</a>.
</li><li> Ewan MacColl's song "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" is far better known as sung by other performers, most notably by Roberta Flack. His radio ballads, such as "The Shoals of Herring" and "Thirty-Foot Trailer" have such a traditional feel that there are singers who don't know he wrote them, much less give him credit.
<ul><li> Ewen MacColl is not the only victim of this trope in folk; A great many modern folksongs are thought to be traditional even though they are original compositions. Another well-known one is Jim McLean's "Glencoe Massacre."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a> has been covered by many artists and has tribute bands like Australian based, Bjorn Again&#133; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod">lauded</a> the original male members.
</li><li> Karla Bonoff wrote several songs that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindaRonstadt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindaRonstadt">Linda Ronstadt</a> recorded. After discovering that she had included some of them on an album of her own, some outraged fans wondered how this Karla Somebody had the nerve to rip off Ronstadt.
</li><li> Even most metalheads might not know Finnish prog band Vanishing Point, but most everyone in the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PowerMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PowerMetal">Power Metal</a> side of things knows their song Two Minds, One Soul, as covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SonataArctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SonataArctica">Sonata Arctica</a>.
