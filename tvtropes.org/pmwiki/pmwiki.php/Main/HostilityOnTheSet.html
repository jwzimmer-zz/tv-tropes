</p><p>In some cases, some actors may be at each other's throats during filming or even a director with one or more actors. While this does not always show on the big screen, it can cause issues like a lack of chemistry between the actors. On the other hand, if the characters they are playing are antagonistic to each other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">this can help add authenticity to their performances and increase their respect for each other</a>.

Two people may be the best of friends in the regular world but constantly butt heads when in a stressful, professional setting like a movie set. As such, while there may be hostility that doesn't mean they actually hate and despise each other. There are many instances where in interviews people try drumming up that drama and they will be the first to defend their co-star.

<ul><li> A bit of a downplayed example, but rather notable for an industry that tries its darndest to project a cheerful image 24/7: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AyaneSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AyaneSakura">Ayane Sakura</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshitsuguMatsuoka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshitsuguMatsuoka">Yoshitsugu Matsuoka</a> are something of a real life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis">Sitcom Archnemesis</a> to one another. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seiyuu/comments/8ucjgh/eng_sub_matsuoka_yoshitsugu_gets_harassed_by/">As reported by seiyuu watchers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, they have a history with each other due to having been peers in the same voice acting training school in the late 2000s. With Matsuoka having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> at the time, he made a terrible first impression on her, and as the years have gone by, her reactions to his presence have grown more and more negative (such as rolling her eyes or pretending to gag when he gets brought up), while he seems to be intimidated by her in general (despite being almost 8 years older). They have been cast in many anime together and are able to be professional around each other then, but things tend to get awkward on offset events such as web radio broadcasts. There is speculation this supposedly terrible relationship between them may be heavily exaggerated by their agents and the hosts for these types of events as a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> with a core of truth to it that straddles the line of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a>.
</li><li> Longstanding friction between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a> and the editors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em> contributed to the demise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>. Despite the exposure having his story featured in <em>Jump</em> afforded him (with <em>Bleach</em> at one point being considered part of the magazine's "Big Three" alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>), Kubo resented what he saw as the editors' attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">interfere in the story he wanted to tell</a> and was not afraid to publicly say so. How the editors at <em>Jump</em> felt about Kubo's sentiment can be gleaned from Ichigo's gradual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillingDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillingDisplacement">Billing Displacement</a> on <em>Jump</em>'s covers over the years, despite him being the main character of what was ostensibly one of the magazine's major titles. This chilly working relationship (along with Kubo suffering from exhaustion and health problems) contributed to his decision to end the series in 2016.
</li><li> One-time example: During a break in recording for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoichiYamadera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoichiYamadera">K&#333;ichi Yamadera</a> - who was new to the <em>entire</em> seiyuu industry at the time, not just the series - mused out loud about Amuro Ray being a "good guy" and Char Aznable being a "bad guy"; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShuichiIkeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShuichiIkeda">Shuichi Ikeda</a> (who plays Char) gave him a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-01-02/shuuichi-ikeda-yelled-at-kouichi-yamadera-while-recording-mobile-suit-gundam-char-counterattack/.110507">rather nasty earful<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in retaliation, insulting Yamadera for being unable to realize that <em>Gundam</em> thrives on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality">Gray-and-Grey Morality</a>. Thankfully, Ikeda apologized afterward.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> anime didn't get a second season because mangaka Natsuki Takaya and director Akitaro Daichi didn't get along and refused to work with each other ever again. The anime was later rebooted in 2019 without Daichi's involvement.
</li><li> English dub examples:
<ul><li> Tristan MacAvery had a massive fallout with Matt Greenfield, resulting in him no longer getting work at ADV Films. He hasn't worked in anime since, and his role of Gendo Ikari in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">taken over</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSwasey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSwasey">John Swasey</a> in further media.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>'s original dub from Optimum Productions had a lot of backstage drama involving producer Nicole Thuault, who was notoriously very difficult to work with. She had fallouts with every single director on the project, including Tracey Moore (who was also the first voice for the title character), Roland Parliament, and John Stocker, resulting in all of their departures, one right after the other. She then took on directing duties herself with the <em>S</em> and <em>SuperS</em> seasons, despite the fact that she only spoke French. This is usually blamed for the decline in quality in the dub for those seasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephanieNadolny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephanieNadolny">Stephanie Nadolny</a> lost her ongoing roles of Kid Goku and Kid Gohan in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise amid some kind of fallout between her Funimation, possibly involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">Christopher Sabat</a>. The exact nature of the fallout isn't clear, but she claims that she hasn't been able to even audition for the studio since 2009 because of drama that took place.
</li><li> An affidavit written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckHuber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckHuber">Chuck Huber</a> in 2019 during the height of a scandal surrounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VicMignogna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VicMignogna">Vic Mignogna</a> about alleged sexual misconduct towards coworkers and fans claims that in the decades before his eventual firing from Funimation, Mignogna had hostile relationships with his fellow Funimation voice actors. According to Huber, these said voice actors often bullied Mignogna for his religious and political beliefs while speaking negatively about his success. Many of Mignogna's supporters have cited the affidavit as proof that his accusers (namely Jamie Marchi, Monica Rial, Sean Schemmel and Chris Sabat) conspired to destroy Mignogna's career out of jealousy. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a></em>: Christian Rub, the voice actor for Gepetto, was a <em>Nazi sympathizer</em> (at the beginning of World War II no less) and frequently upset the cast and crew members by going on tangents where he praised Hitler's actions. The crew members eventually got revenge on him when it was time to film him on a rocking boat set for the animators to use as reference. They apparently apparently rocked the set so hard, they gave him "the ride of his life".
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand">The Allman Brothers Band</a>'s last album, <em>Win, Lose or Draw</em> was aptly titled for a session that was marked by constant fighting amongst the band. It had started with Gregg Allman missing the first day and the other band members, all as coked up as he was, angrily confronting him over his commitment to the band in the face of a solo project (Dicky Betts was one to talk about that, as he had his own solo project beckoning). Eventually it got to the point where the producers had to put together the last, and universally reviled as the worst, album of the band's original run, from whatever jams the band did do together early in the session and those parts that individual members could get done themselves later on (even still, rumor has it that the producers had to do some of the rhythm parts themselves).
</li><li> Tensions between Joey Belladonna and his fellow members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Anthrax">Anthrax</a> peaked during production of <em>Persistence of Time</em>. Joey was resistant to prodding from the others to alter his vocal style for the album; Scott Ian said, "I hated what he was doing and at the same time it was like we were pulling teeth to even get that out of him."
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicKitten">Atomic Kitten</a> were on their third album, tensions between Natasha Hamilton and Jenny Frost were very high. Natasha was dealing with postnatal depression and her commitments to the group had slipped - leading to her no-showing several publicity events. Right before a photoshoot, Natasha turned up with a new hairstyle identical to Jenny's. Things got very heated once they went on their tour - and Natasha even no-showed a gig in Dublin because she'd had a fight with the other two.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> had periods of this:
<ul><li> Recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RubberSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RubberSoul">Rubber Soul</a></em> revealed signs of growing conflict within the group &#150; "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious", he wrote, and "as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right".
</li><li> By the time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe">Let It Be</a></em> came about, the already tense relations between the band members reached a breaking point:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> tried to organise and encourage his bandmates, but his attempts to hold the band together and rally spirits were seen by the others as controlling and patronising.
</li><li> McCartney and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> got into a heated argument during the recording of "Two of Us".
</li><li> Harrison got into a blazing row with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> over creative disengagement from the band. According to journalist Michael Housego of The Daily Sketch, this descended into violence with them allegedly throwing punches at each other. Harrison denied this in a 16 January interview for the Daily Express, saying: "There was no punch-up. We just fell out."

Simonon might as well have left or been forced out as well, given his minimal contribution to what, on the face of things, looked like a Strummer solo album&#151;most of the other instruments were played by unknown musicians the band had hired through anonymous ads in <em>Melody Maker</em> for a hundred pounds a week.
<ul><li> However, Strummer and manager Bernie Rhodes fought bitterly, with Rhodes as determined to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">make a more contemporary Clash</a> that could keep riding the musical tides for another several years as Strummer was to get back to where they once belonged. Rhodes was able to win and record the album <em>his</em> way by stealing the master tapes and adding plenty of synthesizers and effects to most of them; Strummer was so disgusted that, late in production, he tried to get Jones to come back.
</li><li> The result was an end to a once-great band as bitter as <em>Let it Be</em> or <em>Win, Lose or Draw</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> It's common knowledge that conflicts between the members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> permeated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of their final album, <em>Mardi Gras</em> (1972), but the precise details are a matter of dispute. Either way, the tension eventually led to the breakup of the band after the album's release:
<ul><li> The part of the story that everybody basically agrees on is that Doug Clifford and Stu Cook were not big fans of John Fogerty's leadership &mdash; either because Clifford and Cook were envious of all the attention Fogerty received or because Clifford and Cook were fed up with Fogerty's dictatorial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">I Am the Band</a> tendencies, depending on the source. It was because of John's egotism that his brother Tom quit CCR before the recording of <em>Mardi Gras</em>.
</li><li> According to Clifford and Cook, Fogerty tasked them with composing their own individual songs for <em>Mardi Gras</em>, despite their reluctance to contributing more to the album than they were used to. To hear it from them, this was Fogerty's attempt to set them up to fail and be seen as inferior musicians; to reinforce this point, Fogerty did not involve himself in either of their songs.
</li><li> In his autobiography, Fogerty states that it was Clifford and Cook's idea to individually contribute to the album, and that they basically forced him to give them greater power in the band's creative process.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06h61');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note06h61" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06h61');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fogerty refers to this incident as the "night of the generals"</span> When <em>Mardi Gras</em> was released, Fogerty says, his bandmates blamed him for their songs being panned by critics.
</li><li> No matter how exactly things went down, the failure of the album heralded the end of CCR not long afterwards, and the surviving members have literally spent the decades since suing each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a> were so stressed from heavy touring when they went right back into the studio to do <em>Who Do We Think We Are?</em> that before production was over, it had reached the point where none of the members were willing to be in the studion with each other, necessitating careful scheduling by the producer and engineers to get the album finished. They were able to make up afterwards, although the experience contributed to Ian Gillan's departure after the ensuing tour.
</li><li> The reason why drummer Chris Pennie left the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDillingerEscapePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDillingerEscapePlan">The Dillinger Escape Plan</a>. Chris and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">band leader</a> Ben Weinman's relationship went south after <em>Miss Machine</em> released and couldn't work together on a personal or professional level. Tensions got so bad between the two Ben temporarily left the band during a tour with AFI cause he couldn't stand being around Chris. Chris eventually left the band to join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CoheedAndCambria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CoheedAndCambria">Coheed and Cambria</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/79IBM_-xbxk">Singer Greg Puciato explains more about the drama in this interview.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Also, it's never been out right stated, but its been heavily implied that Ben and Greg's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">worsening relationship</a> played a small part in the band breaking up in 2017.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoobieBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoobieBrothers">The Doobie Brothers</a> similar constant touring/recording schedule had brought them considerable success, but at great cost to their personal relationships. By the late 1970s, according to bassist Tiran Porter, "we were all pretty sick of each other", allowing replacement lead singer Michael McDonald to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">dominate the band</a> by the time <em>Minute by Minute</em> was released. But those sessions and the subsequent tour cost them more members, and after their next album, <em>One Step Closer</em>, they were little more than McDonald's backing band.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles">Eagles</a> were definitely this over the years. Especially towards the end. Glenn Frey had a reputation for being difficult to say the least, and had a hard time getting along with EVERYBODY in the group (from initial producer Glyn Johns to bandmates Bernie Leadon and Don Felder). Even his relationship with Don Henley (who co-founded the group with him and was arguably his biggest ally in the group) was fraying.
<ul><li> During the recording of their final original album, <em>The Long Run</em>, Felder at one point told Frey "When this is all over, I'll kick your ass". Months later, late in the band's last concert, with three songs left, Felder looked at Frey, held up three fingers and said "three songs left", to which Frey replied "I can barely wait". Then the two joined for a harmonious rendition of "The Best of My Love". After the show the knock-down drag-out indeed happened, leaving quite a bit of damage in its waking.
</li><li> And then the band still had to do a live album, which required some studio overdubs. Frey and Henley worked from studios on opposite coasts, unable to even be in the same state with each other. The joke was that the Postal Service deserved a producer credit on the ensuing, well-received <em>Eagles Live</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EmersonLakeAndPalmer">Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</a>'s minimal output during their last years can be explained by their even more minimal willingness to work with each other. <em>Love Beach</em>, their last and worst album, came about only because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualObligationProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualObligationProject">contractual obligations</a>.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s notoriously volatile period when everyone was breaking up with and/or cheating on everyone else in the band, the music videos for "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAbfPDZdEBU">Hold Me<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" and "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJOKBURlI1M">Gypsy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" were both filmed when various band members couldn't stand to be around each other. The former uses a lot of close up shots to disguise that they weren't actually near each other and shot their scenes separately, while the latter had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieNicks">Stevie Nicks</a> be made to dance with Lindsey Buckingham, who she didn't want to be in the same room with, and she looks visibly uncomfortable doing so.

<ul><li> Nadine later revealed that the early days of the group, when she was the one chosen to get the most lead vocals, led to a lot of bitterness between the girls.
</li><li> Sarah ended up losing contact with Nicola, Kimberly and Cheryl after the split - remaining only in contact with Nadine.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJacksons">The Jacksons</a>' Victory Tour was rife with this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael</a> had been roped into doing the tour by his mother to help his brothers out and greatly resented doing so; his disgust with the soon-abandoned lottery ticket system didn't help. The brothers attempted to get some sort of unity with a rule that only they could ride in the vans to shows, but Michael soon broke it; by the time he let <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JulianLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JulianLennon">Julian Lennon</a> fly with them on the helicopter to Giants Stadium, they were all glaring at him silently. Eventually it led to separate limos to shows for all of them, Michael even staying in a separate hotel, and Michael and Jermaine letting their lawyers stand in for them at the increasingly frequent meetings between the band, Don King and promoter Chuck Sullivan later in the tour as things started going really sour. Michael saved the coldest dish for last, telling the crowd at the rain-soaked tour finale in Dodger Stadium that this was to be the brothers' last performance together, stunning not only them but King and Joe Jackson, who had been all set to take the tour to Europe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a> have had some tense periods when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">brothers Ray and Dave Davies were squabbling</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15ivt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15ivt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15ivt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sometimes Dave would play badly <em>on purpose</em> to antagonize his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">I Am the Band</a> brother</span>
<ul><li> Dave and drummer Mick Avory were often at odds. In the most notorious (and widely mis-reported) incident, at the Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, South Wales, in 1965, Avory hit Davies with his drum pedal (not the cymbal stand, which, according to later interviews with Avory "would have decapitated him"), in reprisal for Davies kicking over his drum kit as revenge for a drunken fight the previous night in a Taunton hotel, apparently won by Mick. He then fled into hiding for days to avoid arrest for grievous bodily harm. On other occasions, fuming, he would hurl his drumsticks at Dave. According to Ray, their problems began during the time Mick and Dave shared a flat in London for a short period in early 1965. This resulted in Mick leaving the band. They eventually buried the hatchet.
</li></ul></li><li> While it wasn't why he was fired, this was most certainly the case with CJ McCreery and the rest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LornaShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LornaShore">Lorna Shore</a> for a solid year or so before he was fired. While they got along well at first, relations with him started to go downhill by the end of 2018, and when the band went to the studio to record the rest of <em>Immortal</em> in early 2019, he managed to piss off Adam De Micco and Austin Archey by showing up for three days (as opposed to the month-plus that they spent working on it) with poor-quality lyrics and delivering numerous poor takes that had to be cleaned up and stitched together. Once they started doing the year's tours, Adam and Austin (plus newcomer Andrew O'Connor) quickly grew to despise him for his trashy and embarrassing conduct on tour and his habitual laziness and tendency to try and lie and manipulate his way out of everything, as well as his rudeness towards fans and other bands, and when they ended their final tour for the year, they were so sick of him and hated him so much that there was serious talk of firing him. When the allegations against him came out at the end of the year, they mostly just accelerated the inevitable - he had to go for the sake of the band's emotional wellbeing either way, and the allegations just forced their hand early. CJ's old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SignsOfTheSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SignsOfTheSwarm">Signs Of The Swarm</a> bandmate Bobby Crow also went on record to say that the same was true for CJ's time with them, as he regularly displayed all of the same behaviors there and was such a toxic presence and caused so many problems for the band that, in the months before CJ quit to join Lorna Shore, there was a very real possibility of Bobby leaving the band because he could no longer deal with CJ.
</li><li> When recording <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFinalCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFinalCut">The Final Cut</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters">Roger Waters</a> and David Gilmour couldn't stand to be in the same <em>studio</em> as each other, recording their parts in separate studios (Richard Wright having been fired in 1979 during the sessions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>). Waters left the band shortly after its release, declaring Pink Floyd a "spent force," but Gilmour had the last laugh with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AMomentaryLapseOfReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AMomentaryLapseOfReason">the massively successful follow-up</a>.
</li><li> The members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a> hated each other so much that they frequently had physical altercations backstage. The final straw came when they couldn't agree on which drum machine to use for a session (drummer Stewart Copeland had broken his collarbone in a horseback riding accident and was unable to play drums). Andy Summers saw Sting and Copeland arguing about this one morning, so he left and decided to skip most of the day. When he returned to the studio in the late afternoon, his bandmates were still having the same argument, as passionately as they had in the morning, without either of them ready to give in.
<ul><li> Sting so disliked the instrumental "Behind My Camel" from <em>Zenyatta Mondatta</em> that not only did he refuse to play on it, he tried to bury the master tape. Didn't stop him from accepting the Grammy the band won for it, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis">Oasis</a> is notorious for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">acrimonious relationship</a> between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, coming to a head when a backstage fight resulted in the band's breakup.
</li><li> Band relations in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a> were often tense:
<ul><li> Tension between Joey and Johnny colored much of the band's career. The pair were politically antagonistic, Joey being a liberal and Johnny a conservative. Their personalities also clashed: Johnny, who spent two years in military school, lived by a strict code of self-discipline, while Joey struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcoholism. In the early 1980s, Linda Danielle began a relationship with Johnny after having already been romantically involved with Joey. Consequently, despite their continued professional relationship, Joey and Johnny had become aloof from each other. Johnny did not contact Joey before the latter's death, although he said that he was depressed for "the whole week" after his death.
</li><li> Tommy quit the band after being "physically threatened by Johnny, treated with contempt by Dee Dee, and all but ignored by Joey".
</li><li> The tensions among the group members were not kept secret from the public as was heard on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheHowardSternShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheHowardSternShow">The Howard Stern Show</a></em> in 1997, where during the interview Marky and Joey got into a fight about their respective drinking habits.
</li><li> A year after the band's breakup, Marky Ramone made disparaging response against C.J. in the press, calling him a "bigot," a statement he would reiterate a decade later. C.J. would later respond that he was unsure as to why he would make negative comments against him in the press though he denied that it had anything to do with his marrying Marky's niece. He also denied being a bigot. Many years later, C.J. mentioned that despite being the two surviving members of arguably the band's most commercially successful era, and despite reaching out a few times to join him on stage, he and Marky were no longer in contact
</li></ul></li><li> While there were no hostilities in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SClub7">S Club 7</a> during their first run together, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> when Bradley, Jo and Paul toured together as 'S Club 3', Paul eventually stopped appearing with them citing tensions between himself and Jo.
</li><li> The shoot for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur">Tupac Shakur</a>'s "Hit 'Em Up" video was as intense as the actual song. He was engaged in an argument with someone, who was heard telling him "You'll get shot." His armed bodyguard assured him that he had nothing to worry about. He also broke up a fight involving his friend Muta during the filming and fired a production assistant on set. The assistant was answering Shakur's pager and returning his personal calls without his consent. Many callers were confused or angry that a female assistant was answering Shakur's calls. The assistant had mistakenly lost the pager, and with Shakur already growing wary of her, fired her for that reason.
</li><li> Why Woe, Is Me was only around for about four years. A lot of interpersonal conflicts, drug issues, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">an inability to keep a stable lineup</a> led to the band leader Kevin Hansen ending the band after <em>Genesis</em> released in 2013.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LouThesz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LouThesz">Lou Thesz</a> had a longstanding rivalry with/hatred of "Nature Boy" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers">Buddy Rogers</a>, beginning when Rogers made derogatory remarks towards Thesz's manager and longtime friend, wrestling legend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EdStranglerLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EdStranglerLewis">Ed "The Strangler" Lewis</a>. When Rogers was booked to lose the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> World Title to Thesz, Thesz straight-up told him that he was leaving with the belt "the easy way or the hard way." The two would reconcile before Rogers' death in 1992.
</li><li> The professional turned personal rivalry between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rikidozan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rikidozan">Rikidozan</a>'s proteges, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> known as BI Cannnon, eventually lead to them splitting Rikidozan's company, JWA, in two after his death, with Giant Baba going on to found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AntonioInoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AntonioInoki">Antonio Inoki</a> founding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>. While the rivalry was no longer on set, All Japan vs New Japan became legendary in pro wrestling circles, with Super World Of Sports basing half of its programming around it when it poached both of their locker rooms.
</li><li> Thesz had similar, but lesser, problems with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino">Bruno Sammartino</a>, mostly related to the fact that Thesz despised Sammartino's main backer, Joe "Toots" Mondt, and swore he would never make one of his proteges look good in the ring. After kayfabe was destroyed Sammartino came to Thesz's defense on the subject of never winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, saying Thesz would have gone through with dropping the belt to him if it meant gettting the WWWF back in the alliance but Sammartino himself refused to put up with the NWA World Heavyweight champion's schedule if he wasn't at least given Sundays off.
</li><li> While not the main factor(that might be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualtyInTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualtyInTheRing">unfortunate story</a> of Plum Mariko), a split right down the locker room starting with boxer Rumi Kazama and The Beauty Pair's Jackie Sato almost certainly contributed to JWP's inability to effectively compete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanWomensProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanWomensProWrestling">All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling</a>. While the difference in philosophy between Kazama and Sato was the driving force of the divide, Shinobu Kandori ended up being the first person Sato shot on in the ring, and not because she derided Sato as an "entertainer" rather than a "wrestler" but because Kandori called Sato a sloppy wrestler after injuring Kandori. After being injured twice, once deliberately, Kandori warned the staff not to allower her to be booked against Sato again, but they let it happen and Kandori beat Sato into retirement before herself leaving pro wrestling for five years to try <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a>(see Tiger Mask below) before becoming the ace of shoot style promotion and JWP breakway LLPW.

Lawler was a co-owner of the Memphis based USWA promotion, which featured past-their-prime talent and rookies working Memphis and associated towns for very low payoffs.

Both Shooto and Rings ended up being relatively obscure to MMA fans, considered the failed first steps of MMA's toddler years, due to Sayama and Maeda continuing to be pains in the asses of their new business partners and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">locker rooms</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BruiserBrody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BruiserBrody">Bruiser Brody</a> used the ring name "King Kong Brody" out of respect for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DickTheBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DickTheBruiser">Dick the Bruiser</a> in areas where Dick The Bruiser was already established. But do not mistake "respect" for "fondness", as Brody did not like Dick, at least not after Dick became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">a promoter in addition to a wrestler</a>. In one match between them Dick pulled Brody's hair after being specifically told not to touch it. Later in the locker room where Dick expected to be giving Brody payment for the match Brody instead bashed Dick with a chair.
</li><li> Bruiser Brody apparently got along with two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">formerly</a> legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestling">Garbage Wrestling</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a>, The Invaders, apparently having a falling out with Invader #1 after #1 became the booker of CSP/WWC. Regardless of when their falling out happened, Brody was supposed to make Invader #1 look good on a CWC/WWWF show but instead just beat the crap out of him. Later in CSP/WWC there were again sounds of commotion in the locker room, with the assumption being Brody beating someone up again only for Invader #1 to found unscathed standing over a bleeding Brody with a knife. After Brody died from his wound it in turn lead to much hostility between several wrestlers and Invader #1, including popular draws like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk">Terry Funk</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DoryFunkJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DoryFunkJr">Dory Funk Jr.</a>, who were friends with CSP/WWC promoter Carlos Colon but refused to return to Puerto Rico on Principle. Manny Fernandez felt obligated to work with Invader #1 in an angle, but this was only after almost killing the innocent Invader #3 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution">Misplaced Retribution</a>, who he mistook for #1(they wear masks, in case you're wondering)

No less than Jim Crockett, who eventually took control of the entire NWA, hated his guts. Hence Blanchard initially wasn't part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> when it succeeded JCP, despite being a proven draw, but Arn Anderson wasn't either as he was loyal to Blanchard. But eventually Arn and Tully had a falling out too over Tully experimenting with cocaine.

Hogan claims that he and Savage made peace with each other not long before Savage's passing in 2011, but not before Savage turned down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> when Hogan appeared in the locker room to visit with friends.
</li><li> Savio Vega had it with Invader #1 after the stabbing of Bruiser Brody, which he initially avoided when founding his own company, IWA Puerto Rico, by simply refusing to allow Invader #1 to be booked. To a lesser extent he had a grudge with Victor Qui&ntilde;ones for overruling him and booking Invader #1 in IWA Puerto Rico(as it was an extension of IWA Japan, giving Qui&ntilde;ones the final say) and Richard Negrin, for overruling him and booking Invader #1 in The World Wrestling League. In the latter case, Vega and Negrin had a public burial of the hatchet before turning their hostility into an angle that resulted in Vega "breaking away" after a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">Hostile Show Takeover</a> and restarting IWA Puerto Rico after six years of inactivity.

As behind the scenes incidents of professional wrestling became more widely known, their real life antipathy was used for an on camera feud in WCW, most memorably in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">tuxedo match</a> where the two men ignored the stipulation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">convinced fans</a> they had decided to settle their differences then and there.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJack">New Jack</a> had issues with the bookers of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SmokyMountainWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SmokyMountainWrestling">Smoky Mountain Wrestling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">Extreme</a> Championship Wrestling, with the former in fact trading him to the latter after deeming him an ill fit. New Jack believed Jim Cornette to be a racist, and while it would be a stretch to call Cornette a white supremacist, when cutting promos and as a booker Cornette had no problem using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectvillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectvillain">politically incorrect</a> stereotypes for the purpose of building heat and had only a tiny respect for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NWordPrivileges">N-Word Privileges</a>. Cornette, for his part, viewed Jack as a violent trouble maker, and while Jack will argue his actions were justified, even sensible, he did admit to trying to kill an opponent during a match once. With Paul Heyman, Jack took his work being relegated to non televised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffScreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffScreenMomentOfAwesome">dark matches</a> personally and was offended when they were later put back on television in an effort to get TNN to cancel ECW. Jack also refused to work with a few wrestlers Heyman was intent on pushing, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Tazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Tazz">Taz</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2f9eh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2f9eh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2f9eh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Taz himself would ask Heyman for permission to shoot on wrestlers he did not like but unlike Jack, Heyman could still trust Taz to do as he was told</span> For what it's worth, Jack would eventually rebuild his bridges with Cornette after their semi retirements. And even when their relationship was at its worst, Jack said doing business with Cornette was never difficult.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan">Konnan</a> became a breakout star in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a> and became more familiar with the booking and promoting sides of lucha libre, he developed a rather strong dislike of Mil Mascaras for his absolute refusal to job to pretty much anyone up to and including multiple opponents at once.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> had a laundry list of people he would never work with in the ring when he was on top. Notable names include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> (who claimed his Austin 3:16 slogan was blasphemy on a RAW promo, something Austin feared could tank his merchandise sales), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> (Hart broke Austin's neck doing a tombstone piledriver, very nearly permanently paralyzing him; to make matters worse, Owen not only did the move in a manner Austin told him not to (he dropped to his butt, instead of kneeling, and Austin's head was too low for the former), but never apologized for it) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarcMero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarcMero">Marc Mero</a> (who Austin <em>was</em> going to at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squashmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squashmatch">squash</a> until Mero jobbed to Sable).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a>:
<ul><li> During her first run with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, she reportedly let her popularity go to her head and couldn't even be spoken to directly on the phone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LunaVachon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LunaVachon">Luna Vachon</a> claims that she was supposed to be Women's Champion but Sable refused to drop the title or claimed she hadn't brought it with her.

</li><li> In the second run <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson">Torrie Wilson</a> says that they were initially friendly, but after they posed for <em>Playboy</em> together their relationship soured.

</li><li> Juventud Guerrera has publicly accused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan">Konnan</a> of trying to monopolize the lucha libre industry of Mexico and of shitting in his bag. Konnan actually confirmed the bag shitting incident, but passed the blame to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/XPac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/XPac">X Pac</a>, stating he merely did nothing to stop it because he found it funny. Regardless, it lead to a fight between the two that had to be stopped by Jack Evans when Guerrera grabbed a chair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> alienated a lot of people shortly before her departure from the WWF. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a> was irritated by her multiple times during their program for Chyna's lack of professionalism - condescendingly asking her if she knew how to do a hair-pull slam, covering her disrespectfully after their title match at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> X-Seven</em> and not being quiet about how she viewed the women's division as being beneath her.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyCarter">Stacy Carter</a> (best known as Miss Kitty or The Kat) the nastiest person in the WWE (or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAttitudeEra">The Attitude Era</a> specifically) was Janet the make-up artist. Stacy recalls her one day locking the Godfather's Hos inside a dark room and wouldn't let them out. Josette Bynum - who encountered Janet during some of her tryout matches - confirms this, saying that Janet would attack her for being in a certain area of the building (that she had been told to be in by agents).
</li><li> Gabe Sapolsky's dislike of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi">Low Ki</a> and Steve Corino explains why they had shorter pushes than their popularity would suggest in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>, where he did the booking. Still, Sapolsky found them nothing if not reliable until Ki legitimately knocked out Ahtu on an EVOLVE card, where Sapolsky was again doing the booking. He also described <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Steen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElGenerico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElGenerico">El Generico</a> as "difficult" to work with, though still used them in an effort to establish ROH in Quebec, which for better or worse didn't pan out.
</li><li> The WWE Diva Search was a gimmick thought up in 2003 where they would audition a lot of models, actresses and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms Fanservices</a> to find a new Diva for the company. The first winner just won a photoshoot for a magazine, but the next year it was upgraded into a search for someone who would join the company and earn a contract worth $250,000. The talent were not happy with a non wrestler immediately making more than most of them, and this was exacerbated when the contestants were told not to bother them backstage - earning them reputations for being aloof and snobby (Amy Weber later left the company after suffering too much bullying from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>). Within the contestants themselves, Carmella DeCesare earned a lot of heat by acting rude towards everyone else. In a segment titled 'Diss the Diva', allowing the remaining contestants to have a live mic and trash talk their opponents - the other three gave Carmella a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonYouSuckSpeech">"Reason You Suck" Speech</a> each (compared to the more playful teasing they gave the others). Ironically when they turned this into a storyline, Carmella's kayfabe rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristyHemme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristyHemme">Christy Hemme</a>, was the one girl she appeared to get on with (in her 'Diss the Diva' promo she said "Christy, I hope you win" and sincerely congratulated her when she won).
</li><li> Teddy Hart entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> with baggage from an earlier feud with Steve Corino, warning Gabe Sapolsky that he would beat Corino up if he signed Hart. Instead of that promised confrontation, Hart picked a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, decided to back out of it when Punk showed up, then changed his mind again and tried to rearrange Punk's face before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sabu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sabu">Sabu</a> separated them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fjys');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3fjys" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fjys');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hart has bipolar disorder and refuses to medicate it, so his behavior can be erratic, Punk probably should have just left before he got manic</span>. This, along with several other backstage incidents in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> and several unplanned scramble cage dives in ROH got Hart blackballed by both companies <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4uueu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4uueu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4uueu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">ROH brought him back for one night appearances after proving he could behave himself "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cameo">as a fan</a>". TNA tried to bring him back but that just lead to more trouble</span>. Contrary to popular belief, Punk was not fired for his part in the fight but willingly left TNA over a contract dispute when TNA tried to bar him from returning to ROH after the Rob Feinstein scandal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Mistico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Mistico">M&iacute;stico</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">Dos Caras Jr</a> haven't exactly made their disdain for each other secret. The former actually pulled a gun on the latter during a locker room confrontation. This didn't stop Jr from later threatening to beat down Mistico after the latter called for referee stoppage during a match they had in WWE, and later still their mutual hostility caused Mistico to leave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AAA">AAA</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a> hasn't exactly made his feeling of betrayal for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata">Katsuyori Shibata</a>'s departure to form "Big Mouth Loud", where he would bash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> while Tanahashi was trying to save it, or his distaste for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KatsuyoriShibata">Katsuyori Shibata</a>'s style of wrestling a secret. While the two might not be professional enough to keep their mouths shut, it hasn't lead to any locker room fights or match breakdowns; they do business together well enough.
</li><li> Back in 2005 after he was traded over to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">WWE SmackDown</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> was <em>very</em> unhappy about this, stating that the "B" show roster was lazy because they knew if they goofed up on Tuesday, they could just edit it to what they wanted before the Thursday broadcast. This won him zero respect backstage and the tension continued while filming promos for that year's <em>SummerSlam</em> with him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a> getting into it which culminated with the latter knocking the former down with a single punch.
</li><li> In 2006 the tag team MNM had to be split up, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">Johnny Nitro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Melina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Melina">Melina</a> moved to Raw because tensions in the stable between them and Joey Mercury were just too high. In fact, Melina in general was a nuclear heat magnet, to the point where she was taken to Wrestler's Court and yelled at until she cried.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichelleMcCool">Michelle McCool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix">Beth Phoenix</a> were a mild example. They worked a match together in 2008 that ended with Michelle getting a concussion due to a botched Glam Slam from Beth. The latter never said anything about it afterwards, leading Michelle to believe she hadn't realised. Then over a year later when they began feuding on-screen, she read an article in a magazine that showed Beth did know she had injured her after all. Their 2010 program was apparently marked with a few moments where Beth went to the office to get some of their segments changed. Beth did, however, thank Michelle in her Hall of Fame induction speech in 2017.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> became a hostile working environment for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> after the former had an affair with the latter's wife that lead to a divorce, and a custody settlement that ended up being more public than Angle wanted. This one ended up being turned into an onscreen angle, but not before TNA's financial backer Dixie Carter flipped and suspended Jarrett from tapings. When TNA stopped making a profit as Carter exerted more and more control over it, Jarrett attempted to buy back the company from Panda Energy but opted out of the deal after Carter's parents insisted Dixie remain in a visible place with some level of authority.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AustinAries">Austin Aries</a> has a long running feud with TNA management in general and Impact Vice President Don Callis in particular, at one point showing up at ROH shows "as a fan" in protest to TNA contract terms and signing an ROH contract on the spot the moment he was fired long distance for it. Another case was he and Davey Richards actively trying to have an underwhelming match after leaving Impact Wrestling, again, on not so well terms. His most visible instance of defiance though was on an Impact Wrestling pay per view where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">no sold</a> starship pain, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a>, just to give an offensive gesture to Callis, leaving Morrison bewildered. To a lesser extent, Aries has a vocal feud with Jim Cornette, who was in TNA, ROH and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MLW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MLW">MLW</a> with him, though it was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">usually</a> docile Carrie Silkin who ultimately fired Aries for mouthing off about not getting paid enough, even if Cornette was the one who had issue with Aries getting more money than every other wrestler in ROH while doing the least work.

In an interview with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DivaDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DivaDirt">Diva Dirt</a></em> Mercedes said that things got to the point where she suffered a concussion in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">War Games match</a> at the 5th Anniversary Show and, despite warning Jessicka, the latter still hit her with her finisher anyway. That said, Martinez worked out enough with Havok to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SHIMMER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SHIMMER">SHIMMER</a> title defense against her in a cross promotional event(Garly Pop's <em>Life Love And Lady Wrestling</em>) without incident and a lengthy program with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllysinKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllysinKay">Allysin Kay</a> in SHINE.

<ul><li> After her famous 'Pipe Bombshell' promo on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> cast, there was legitimate heat between AJ and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidheart">Natalya</a>. The latter was genuinely offended by AJ's words, feeling it had invalidated all her hard work to make it to WWE (as she was the only non model-turned-wrestler in the cast).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Cameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Cameron">Cameron</a> has said that AJ was very difficult to work with and seemed unwilling to help guide a greener opponent in the ring.

</li><li> Subverted with Nikki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella</a>. A lot of dirtsheets reported that Nikki was the Diva offended by the above promo, while Nikki later clarified she was simply annoyed with how little mic time Brie got in the subsequent feud with AJ (Brie would never say anything when AJ would get lengthy promos trashing her, making her look quite weak). It was however rumored that Nikki's final promo before their match at <em>WrestleMania 31</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a> ("we've seen you less than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>") - referring to AJ's lack of appearances and interest in the division for several months. She did however say in a 2019 podcast with Paige that a dream match would involve the twins getting to team with her and AJ.

</li></ul></li><li> Yoshiko admitted that she and Act Yasukawa didn't get along after she turned the latter's shot at the World Of STARDOM into a shoot so ugly Kyoko Kimura had to throw in the towel to prevent a repeat of Kandori and Sato. This in turn lead to animosity among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WorldWonderRingSTARDOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WorldWonderRingSTARDOM">World Wonder Ring STARDOM</a>'s owners, as their inability to come to a consensus on how to punish Yoshiko split the company in two, Nanae Takahashi forming SEAdLINNG with her half. Nanae <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">thrashed</a> Yoshiko in the SEAdLINNG ring...before becoming her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> partner and then pushing YOSHIKO as the singles champion, as she had in STARDOM.
</li><li> Lee Cahalane - promoter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CelticChampionshipWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CelticChampionshipWrestling">Celtic Championship Wrestling</a> in Ireland - was not a popular man.
<ul><li> Raven Creed confessed in 2019 that as soon as she had turned eighteen, Lee tried to kiss her in a nightclub. Months later when she was the victim of a drink being spiked, Lee tried to kiss her again while she was barely conscious. Her boyfriend Matt Skylar threatened Lee to never do that again, and was punished by not being booked for six months.
</li><li> LJ Cleary and Valkyrie eventually stopped working for CCW after Lee refused to pay them for their matches (they initially had travel costs covered, but asked for actual payment after they'd had more bookings). Lee eventually granted this but told Raven Creed to stiff Valkyrie in retaliation for this. He had only booked Valkyrie in the first place in the hopes of sleeping with her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DarrenBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DarrenBurns">Darren Burns</a> referred to the promotion as "a cancer to Irish wrestling" and only wrestled there because it was too far for him to travel to train at other promotions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KateyHarvey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KateyHarvey">Katey Harvey</a> was constantly clashing with Lee, first for being booked in an embarrassing 'Hairspray on a Pole' match that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">embarrassed of to this day</a>. Then for unsafe working conditions - she publicly denounced them when Lorcan Wood got a broken jaw thanks to his inexperienced opponent. She continued working for them for a few more years, but eventually stopped after a show where a botch led to an opponent getting a broken neck.
</li><li> Marion Armstrong claims he witnessed the first attempted molesting of Raven Creed, and Lee then tried to kiss him to cover it up. The last straw for him was a debacle of a press conference to promote a show where only six people turned up. After said show, he took the CCW roster with him and set up a new promotion in <em>Phoenix Wrestling</em>.

Steiner was infuriated when Page's then-wife Kimberly implicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TammyLynnSytch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TammyLynnSytch">Tammy Lynn Sytch</a> for drug possession, leading to Sytch's departure. After Steiner returned to the locker room, Page confronted him and they started fighting backstage. In a departure from many recollections of backstage brawls and real fights of professional wrestlers, Page freely admits that he was no match for Steiner.

Cornette is a wrestling traditionalist, while Russo, well, isn't, so there were many creative differences between the two. To this day, Cornette has nothing but unbridled disdain for Russo (and Russo isn't too fond of Cornette either), to the point where Cornette's life goal is to outlive Russo so that he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDisrespects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDisrespects">piss on his grave</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonMoody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonMoody">Ron Moody</a> noted that several members of the original West End stage cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Oliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Oliver">Oliver!</a></em> (1960) did not get along saying: "It was not a happy company". He personally had a poor relationship with Georgia Brown, who was the original Nancy. When the film came to be made, Brown blamed Moody for her not being cast as Nancy. However, Moody categorically denied this, saying he had no say or influence whatsoever over the casting of the film and he himself was far from the first choice to play Fagin despite his success on stage.
</li><li> In the 1970s, Nicol Williamson and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenMirren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenMirren">Helen Mirren</a> co-starred in a disastrous production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> where they absolutely hated each other. Years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBoorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBoorman">John Boorman</a> cast them as enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Excalibur">Excalibur</a></em>, believing that their natural animosity would be perfect. Neither realised the other was in the film until they'd signed on. Mirren recalled that they got on very well once they were "freed from the shackles of <em>Macbeth</em>".
</li><li> Nicol Williamson was a habitual offender. His history of backstage misbehavior was so notorious that when he was cast as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBarrymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBarrymore">John Barrymore</a> in Paul Rudnick's comedy <em>I Hate Hamlet</em> in 1991, it was against the express advice of the casting director. In a 2007 <em>New Yorker</em> article, Rudnick recalls Williamson binge-drinking, sexually harrassing the stage manager, offering unsolicited "direction" to co-stars, and&mdash; eventually&mdash; jabbing Evan Handler, who played the lead, in the buttocks with a prop sword during a swordplay sequence. (Handler walked off the production that night and did not return to the role.)

This spilled over into filming as they repeatedly stopped the shoot to scream at each other over how they wanted to block their scenes. They also fought with Ed Glaser (a much more experienced professional filmmaker than either of them) when he brought up the 180-degree rule, causing Ed to vow to never work with them again. Ed was later credited as the film's Director of Photography despite his protests.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Animation&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It's no secret that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> made working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> a blessing and a curse. When he wasn't holed up in his office to avoid confrontation and leaving others to the heavy lifting on his cartoons for him, he was an outright terror of a director to work for.
<ul><li> Many of the artists working on the show noted how his directions were not only hostile but often vague, with Kricfalusi often frequently ripping up artists' drawings for no better reason than it wasn't exactly what he saw in his head and forbidding them from ever deviating from the layouts. When he tore up one background because he didn't like the bright colors, calling it "fucking candy cane lane," several artists decorated the studio with a sign that read "Candy Cane Lane" and drawings of Ren and Stimpy with candy canes up one another's butts as a form of passive-aggressive protest.
</li><li> He pushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillyWest">Billy West</a> to his limits and beyond, with West even getting damage to his vocal cords from the grueling recording sessions, and would often give vague directions like "You're 98% there." West could also not be swayed by bullying (he had grown up with an abusive father), which drove Kricfalusi madder than he would already be.
</li><li> Worst of all was John's complete lack of professionalism and willingness to make his baggage other people's problems, such as firing storyboard artist Chris Reccardi solely for dating John's ex-girlfriend Lynne Naylor (Reccardi and Laylor married two years after John was fired and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">remained together</a> until Reccardi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">fatal heart attack in May 2019</a>, proving what little good this did). Kricfalusi also rewarded Bob Jacques for his hard work on "Sven H&ouml;ek" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">spending hours chewing him out over the phone for how "Disney like" the cartoon looked, and only began praising the cartoon when it became a fan favorite episode.</a> And when <em>Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksman</em> initially only credited Reccardi for directing after John was fired from the show, John was so enraged that he threatened to sue Nickelodeon for millions if he wasn't properly credited on the film (Nick relented and put his name on the credits). The day that most of the crew moved into Games Animation, he personally followed members around and verbally abused them to their faces.
</li><li> Relations between John K and everyone else on staff during the first two seasons eventually became so unbearable that Bob Camp would invite staff members into his office to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchAWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchAWall">kick the wall</a> (with a sign over it reading "John's Knees") to get aggression out. By the end of Kricfalusi's run on the show, the wall had been reduced to a massive hole.
</li><li> This was also the case during the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRippingFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRippingFriends">The Ripping Friends</a></em>. Funbag Animation manager John Shaw had explicitly told his staff to disregard John K.'s style guide and left it sitting on the front desk for weeks. When John K. came to the studio and found out, the two came dangerously close to stepping outside for "fistcuffs." Kricfalusi apologized, but was banned from the studio the next day. As a result of the banning John K. was forced to do much of the layout revisions he could from a nearby hotel room.
</li></ul></li><li> Tensions between the creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> in the original 65 episodes run were quite real. Arlene Klasky and Paul Germain clashed on creative directions; the former wanted the characters to act more like realistic babies, while the latter favored strong characterization. Angelica was the big point of argument - Arlene Klasky not wanting an antagonist and hating how mean she was, Paul Germain instead wanting to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> and explore why a child might become a bully. He ended up leaving the show before the episodes even aired. Arlene Klasky continued to be unpopular with a lot of the animators; she would speak to some of them in baby talk to illustrate how she wanted the Rugrats to act, and they made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> out of Didi's obsession with the terrible advice of Dr Lipschitz specifically to mock her - as she was a great believer in such parenting books.

<ul><li> The last part of Judith Krantz's <em>Scruples</em> involves the making of a film directed by the heroine's new husband.
