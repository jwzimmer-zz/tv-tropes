And yet, you find people using it for most of the game, despite not being the actual "best" weapon available. Perhaps the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">too hard to get</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> doesn't show up until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">five minutes before</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight.

That's the sword meant to be the best that you'll always end up replacing anyways. With this sword, you normally don't want to replace it, and if you don't do some special quest, you probably can't.

Its high power and speed will get you through a large part of the game. Later on, the Vampire Killer itself takes on this role &mdash; it's not one of the game's several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Swords</a> and you don't have to go out of your way to get it (just beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>), but many players stick with it for its ease of use and handy elemental attributes.
<ul><li> Abusing a small glitch to double jump early (which normally comes just after Nation of Fools) can get you the Nebula (a homing whip), the most powerful whip that is obtained before Vampire Killer <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note038u7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note038u7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note038u7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For some reason various other whips better than it but worse than Vampire Killer can be obtained <em>after</em> you get Vampire Killer</span>, a powerful weapon that will last until endgame unless you abuse a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a> to buy the Holy Claymore early.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></em>, there is an enormously powerful weapon called Death's Scythe that can only be found about halfway through the game and only if one is playing Hard Mode. It has more raw attack power than the bonus sword "Claimh Solais" and has the greatest reach in the game, but it's Dark element, which a lot of enemies are resistant to, and its great reach is offset by being slow and unable to hit things at point-blank. The Claimh Solais is Holy element, which nearly every enemy is weak to, has a faster swing, and has a more forgiving hitbox even if it doesn't reach quite as far.
<ul><li> Not to mention Death's Scythe is one of two weapons that annihilates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Julius Belmont</span>, who is neutral to dark and tremendously resistant to holy. The Claimh Solais is hardly more useful than Soma's <em>bare fists</em> against him.
</li><li> There is also the Balmung if it isn't Hard Mode which only slightly less powerful than the Claimh Solais and is of the Darkness type meaning its effective against that one boss mentioned above.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Fire Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a>: Blood Omen</em>. It does high damage, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Sword</a>. However, it's not a patch on the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, the Soul Reaver (which would later obtain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> status in the sequels), which can one-hit kill bosses. However, the Fire Sword is still preferable in most situations, as the Soul Reaver drains the players magic, and prevents them from casting any spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The first game</a> has the White Sword, which is more powerful than the Wooden Sword obtained at the start of the game but less powerful than the Magical Sword.
</li><li> The Master Sword from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> is like this to Biggoron's Sword, which requires an extremely long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> complete with several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Missions</a> to get. The Master Sword is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> that you obtain through the course of normal play (and a good example of Infinity Minus One Sword overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>). Biggoron's Sword being a two-handed sword that denies usage of a shield also helps, though a quick-fingered player can get around this by simply drawing another item when about to be attacked, then switching back to the sword.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, the Biggoron Sword serves as such as well, with the addition of <em>permanently</em> preventing you from continuing to repair and reuse the higher-damaging Giant's Knife, which is capable of dealing out an extra blow each time it's repaired.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Razor Sword. In the mountain area, you have to restore the blacksmith's forge by melting the ice around it with a Fire Arrow or defeating Snowhead Temple's boss, which allows him to forge the Razor Sword for you immediately. The Razor Sword is much more powerful than the Kokiri Sword, but dulls after 100 uses and can't be taken back with you through time. However, the best Sword upgrade, the Gilded Sword, can't be obtained until you've completed Snowhead Temple, opened the way to the Goron Races, completed the races in first place to win gold dust, and brought the gold dust to the forge - which probably won't happen until a few cycles later, whereas the Razor Sword is available pretty much as soon as you get to Snowhead and, despite its weaknesses, will be what you'll be using until you unlock the Gilded Sword so long as you can stomach going without the Kokiri sword for the entire day that the smiths need to sharpen the blade.
</li><li> The Gilded Sword. You can obtain it roughly halfway into the adventure and there are two more powerful swords after it. However, one requires you to complete 99% of the fourth dungeon, (and like the Biggoron's Sword, prevents you from using your shield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">because of its massive size</a>) and the other can only be obtained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperPower">by collecting all the masks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword">and it only works on boss' fights</a>. Fortunately, the Gilded Sword itself is pretty awesome with its long range and great strength.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>, the Noble Sword is this, though it's the most powerful sword the first game played can be finished with. (The Master Sword is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> of these games, and can only be obtained after linking the two games together after finishing one of them, and can only be used in the first one played after it's already beaten.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em> uses this on most everything. You not only have the Goddess Sword (and unpowered Master Sword) but you have your potions, gear, and even shields which can all be upgraded to "master" level by investing tons of time collecting bugs, ore, and goop. And speaking of shields, each one has their own weaknesses and strengths. The Wooden Shield will burn up if Link is set ablaze and its durability is quite low, but since wood is an insulator it blocks electrical attacks. The Iron Shield has more durability than the Wooden Shield, but it can't block electrical attacks because it's conductive. The Sacred Shield is the game's Infinity -1 shield, being a step below the unbreakable, block-everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Hylian Shield</a>; the shield resists fire, electricity, cursed attacks, has self regeneration, and it can cause undead monsters to cower in fear, but its durability (without upgrades) is worse than the Wooden Shield.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>, the Tempered Sword can be had fairly early the Dark World with some minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> and is what you'll wind up using for the majority of the game's dungeons, as the Golden Sword doesn't become available until shortly before the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Master Sword is given to you roughly halfway through Legend Mode. It has an attack stat of 300, at a point in the game where most of your other weapons will probably only have around a third of that. Eventually is does get surpassed by other Level 3 weapons, but those all require significantly more time and effort to acquire. Once you have all the Level 3 weapons, you can upgrade the Master Sword and raise its attack power to 500, giving it the highest raw damage in the game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1uarb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1uarb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1uarb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though due to its lack of skill slots, other weapons can still be situationally better</span> making it both the Infinity Minus One Sword <em>and</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. It also helps that it alters Link's moveset to grant him the ability to fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">energy waves on attacks</a> when he's on full health, essentially making most of his attacks hit twice, if not more times if he's undamaged. If an attack already fires a projectile, it fires more.
</li><li> Most characters (including Link with his other weapon types) require an excess amount of grinding to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">perfect</a> weapon. First you've got to get one with both the highest attack power and maximum skill slots, which unfortunately can only be obtained through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops">Random Drops</a>. Then you've got to find all the skills you want and probably transfer them over from other weapons, which requires you to grind both thousands of kills to unlock the skills and hundreds of thousands of rupees to transfer them over and delete unwanted skills off the perfect weapon. Oh, and did we mention there's over thirty different movesets in this game and you have to do this for every single one? For most players, it just isn't worth the time investment for the marginal improvement, except maybe for their favorite character. So for most characters you're just going to make do with whatever 5 star level 3 weapon you happen to have on hand, even though it's probably not optimal.

Acquiring the Master Sword only requires you to have 13 heart containers. The sword itself only has an attack power of 30 and it runs out of energy after 40 hits. Unlike other weapons that break, the Master Sword goes on a 10 minute cooldown when its energy runs out. Because of its low attack power, most players will only use the sword on weak enemies or to cut grass. Thus, it functions as the Infinity -1 Sword. However, the sword powers up if you're in the presence of a Guardian, a Blight Ganon, or Ganon himself. During its powered up state, the sword's power is doubled to 60 (which is on par with some high-end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">zweihanders</a>) and its durability is boosted to an insane 11,400 (<a class="urllink" href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Master_Sword#Breath_of_the_Wild">no, we're not making that up<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). Thus, it functions as the Infinity +1 Sword, but only in certain situations. Fully completing the Trial of the Sword DLC will keep the Master Sword's double strength and enhanced durability permanently, but that's a fifty-four-floor dungeon in three parts; thus, it functions as the Infinity +1 Sword, with all the struggle that entails.

The strongest of them on paper was Zodiac, costing 1500000 bolts (and another 10k a shot), making R.Y.N.O.II, at a price tag of mere <em>million</em> bolts and available much sooner than Zodiac, <em>technically</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a>. The true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Arsenal</a> however would be the trio of Bouncer, which was so broken it could clear any room by itself save for flying enemies (obtainable on 8th planet for 100k bolts), Plasma Coil (available one planet later for 150k bolts), which fully upgraded could also clear a room full of enemies, <em>including flying enemies</em>, and Shield Charger (100k bolts and available 3/4ths into the game), which enabled shield that provided invulnerability until it dissipated.

<ul><li> A curious example of a weapon both fulfilling this trope <em>and</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a></em> is Sora's Blades from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games">.hack//Outbreak</a></em>. To elaborate, while each of the .hack Quadrilogy features their own version of Infinity Plus One Swords obtainable only through post-game dungeons, Outbreak features a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em> reference quest in which you rescue Sora (or at least, his apparition) from Skeith's wand, referring to the last SIGN episode. As a reward, you are given the eponymous Sora's Blades. While its raw stats aren't as good as the game's purported Infinity +1 Sword, its status effect Death reduces a target's HP to 10% and triggers randomly on every non-Skill hit. It is so effective that it functions as Outbreak's true Infinity +1 Sword. Even better, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">carries over</a> to Quarantine, the last of the Quadrilogy, where it becomes this trope, as even the strongest weapons on Volume 4 cannot match the brokenness of Death effect.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">Kirkhammer</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> can be obtained after killing a single boss, staggers just about anything in its transformed mode and has a fast one-handed sword as its alternative mode. The three starter eapons could also be considered this since they all can easily carry one through the entire game, depending on your build.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> has the infamous Zweih&auml;nder, affectionately referred to as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Bass Cannon</a>, which, while nowhere near being the most powerful weapons in its class, has very low stat requirements, doesn't weigh a lot, deals reliable damage and can stagger all but the biggest of non-boss enemies (and can reliably perma-stun the likes of Smough/Giant Ornstein) with its heavy attack, making it also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke">Disk One Nuke</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em>, several powerful weapons can be obtained extremely early. Besides the master weapons, Wellow's Pickhammer and the Cutlass Bluetane (the legendary pickhammer and cleaver respectively) can be obtained before doing a single quest and will serve well for most of the game. Similarly, the legendary longsword, the Harbinger, can be obtained halfway through the game and is the third strongest one handed weapon in the game. While the Sword of Aeons and Avo's Tear are tied for strongest, both can only be obtained after beating Jack of Blades, leaving either only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a> or expansion left to enjoy them.
<ul><li> For two handed weapons, exploiting the Hero Save function makes it possible to obtain the Murren Greathammer, the third highest damage weapon and containing one of the few experience augmentations in the game, before doing the Trader Escort mission.
</li><li> With the addition of DLC content in Fable: Anniversary, the weapons Axel the Axe and Sophia's Sword are now available, though expensive, from the very beginning of the game, and both feature extremely high damage, comparable to end-game legendary weapons like the Katana Hiryu or the Bereaver.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has a few of these.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">First game:</a> the Oblivion. And to an extent, the Lionheart thanks to its easy unlock requirements, and stats.

<ul><li> If you want to make a short trip to the library in the same world, you might even end up preferring Divine Rose over Oblivion.
</li><li> If you're interested in maximizing your magic power, Lady Luck is available from Wonderland, after the first battle against Riku in Hollow Bastion. It has the strongest magic stats, barring the Diamond Dust won from a difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. The magic strength matches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ultima Weapon</a>, making it helpful for quickly plowing through Olympus Coliseum rounds and general farming with enhanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> magic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>: Oblivion again, and / or the Decisive Pumpkin <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ddth');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2ddth" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ddth');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ultima Weapon and Fenrir are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">plus-ones</a></span>.

Once you obtain the Oathkeeper it WILL be in the offhand slot of your Drive Form of choice, despite its lack of raw stats.
</li><li> The Final Mix version added another in the form of Two Become One. While it has <em>slightly</em> less physical power than Oblivion and Decisive Pumpkin, some players may nonetheless prefer it due to its balanced stats, having both solid strength and magic.
</li></ul></li><li> Each of the three protagonists has their own minus-one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em>, that has stats tailored to their personal strengths. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Aqua</a> gets Brightcrest, which significantly boosts her magic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Ven</a> gets Lost Memory, which has balanced strength and magic. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Terra</a> gets two of them; either Chaos Ripper, which has incredibly high strength stats but actually <em>reduces</em> magic, or Ends of the Earth, which is still strength-focused, but has no magic penalty. Aqua only gets Brightcrest in the Final Episode, though: in her storyline, this role falls to Stormfall or Pixie Petal, the former having balanced stats but the latter boosting her magic higher.
</li><li> <em>Re:coded</em> has the Zero/One, won for defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a> a hour or so before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. It has good abilities attached for boosting magic and strength, while the reward for beating the Final Boss has solely defense-oriented abilities and Keyblades that outperform Zero/One are acquired in the difficult optional system sectors.
</li><li> If you're not one to go out of your way in the slightest, you'll likely be using Counterpoint for the entire final level of <em>Dream Drop Distance</em>. If you're reasonably skilled enough and willing to spend about ten minutes gathering the remaining A ranks for each dive segment, however, the Divewing outperforms it in magic and crit rates. It's relatively worth the effort, considering obtaining any better weapon would require hours of special portal grinding or Flick Rushing<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, and/or struggling against superbosses that only show up after you've already finished the game</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII">Overlord II</a></em> has The Reaper, which is an axe that absorbs health every time it connects an attack. In case The Apocalyptor is too expensive for you and you want to save up the finite Dark Crystals for other stuff (armor or Minion upgrades), it'll do perfectly unless you want to be a full-on Sauron clone.
</li><li> A few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em>, it ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">disadvantage</a> to use the final Weapon Orb for certain weapons due to the lack of weapon bonuses. The Gigas Axe ends up being stronger than the Doom Axe across the board due to the five point strength boost. The Doom Bow and the Shuriken both end up doing more damage than the Garuda Buster and the Ninja's Trump due to their high critical hit rates.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em> has the Eternal Sphere/Aeterna.

In fact, it's so powerful, it's arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> for certain playstyles.
<ul><li> The other protaganist, Rena's, ultimate weapon is supposedly the synthesisable Emprezia, and it does have the highest physical power of any of her weapons. However, her role as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> means she'll get much more use out of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">knuckles of plot advancement</a> the Fallen Hope Knuckles/Knuckles of Hope which give the same magic power bonus as the Emprezia (the highest she can get from any weapon), a boost to her defense stat, and <em>halves the cost of all of her spells</em>. Since the Emprezia can be created fairly soon after arriving on Nede, while the Knuckles of Hope are obtained in a plot event near the end of the main-game, it creates the unusual situation of the infinity+1 weapon being used as a placeholder for the infinity-1 weapon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfBlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfBlackMagic">Celine's</a> Silver Moon rod has a magic stat only slightly lower than the Dragon's Tusk, and periodically restores her MP. The player also doesn't have to worry about her customization skill since one can simply be stolen from her during a Private Action in Armlock.
</li><li> Dias's Crimson Diablos has a lower attack stat on paper than the Cromlea Sword he gets from the battle arena in Fun City. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">The game doesn't mention</a> that the Crimson Diablos gives a free Atlas Ring effect, doubling Dias's attack power.
</li><li> Leon's Ancient Wisdom tome is only slightly weaker than his ultimate tome, periodically restores some of his MP, <em>and</em> halves the cost of all of his spells, making it the weapon of choice for many players even in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em>, most players stick with the Chaos Blade, the second-most powerful one-handed sword. The Rune Blade has better overall stats, but the Chaos Blade takes a lower Forging Skill score to make and has a raft of nifty status effects to boot (including HP Absorb, Paralysis and 30% crit rate). It's also far faster and easier to use than any two-handed sword, war hammer, or battle axe of similar crafting level (and has a wider attack range than any non-sword). And all that is assuming they haven't finished the main quest with the Heaven Asunder before they're even able to forge the Chaos Blade.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> has a weapon called "Laser Weapon", which can be purchased any number of times, and which any character can equip. Interestingly enough, these are only a little weaker than the character's ultimate weapons, and require significantly less work. Also, since any characters can use them, they are often buffed using the in-game item-synthesis to make a beat-down stick to swap between characters. They also deal standard damage, while some characters' final weapons deal elemental damage, making them more useful while in areas with enemies who have resistance or immunity to elemental effects.
</li><li> The Violent Light sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a> IV: Mask of the Sun</em>. It's not even found until near the end of the game, well after obtaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>, which is required for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. And nearly all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">gimmick sword magics</a> suck anyways.
<ul><li> The Silver Sword, Armor and Shield in <em>Ys I</em>, which are all the second most-powerful of their kind. You can gather the whole set by the halfway point of the game, and while you'll find more powerful versions of each in the last stretch of the final dungeon, you once again can't even <em>scratch</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> without equipping the whole set.

Unfortunately getting things like the Boink Hammer and Excalibur requires levelling up Phantoms to Level 20 and converting them, or winning your way through the difficult arena battles. As well the mightiest summonable creature and spells requires a unique rune that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> (specifically it required the Japanese guidebook). But much earlier, you can summon Dragons which are the 2nd most powerful creatures in the game and unlike the Fynus, is fairly easy to the runes for them (additionally the Dragon is the longest-ranged creature in the game, while the Fynus are pure melee only).

<ul><li> The M16 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a> 2</em>. Once you get it, you won't really be using anything else, except maybe the flare gun for the Zealots, Gideon and Ishmael's original body, the Chain Gun for bosses, Napalm for Goddamn Bats and maybe the Sniper Rifle for avoiding direct confrontation. Everything else is either rendered obsolete by it, useless entirely, or just there for novelty purposes, like impersonating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phantasm">Tall Man</a>.
</li><li> Because of the way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrops">Random Drops</a> work in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> series, it can take hours if not days to see a legendary weapon drop, especially in the sequels&mdash;favorites like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Infinity</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">Cobra</a> can take <em>ages</em> to appear because of the way the game reads drop rates. Conversely, it's a lot more reasonable and practical to do a few side missions and keep an eye out for any with a blue or purple reward icon&mdash;those usually indicate some sort of unique named item which, while not being as absurdly powerful as a legendary item, are <em>much</em> easier to get and still have some sort of very handy ability, such as how Moxxi's weapons tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">heal you when damaging enemies</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em> series has the trio of 9x39mm weapons. A silenced sniper rifle (VSS Vintorez), a silenced assault rifle (AS Val), and an assault rifle with an attached grenade launcher (OTs-14), each of them hits like a truck. The ammo they use is heavy and hard to find in large amounts before the endgame, but the weapons hit so hard that small amounts of ammunition are all you really need. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Gauss Rifle</a> still wins for sheer damage output, but by the time you get it, you're probably already stocked up with 9x39 weapons.
<ul><li> In <em>Call of Pripyat</em> you can just simply get the AK-74 or the AN-94 (which you can get within the first half an hour of the game from some random corpse or a zombie), upgrade it to maximum, and then it will easily rival most NATO rifles and even sniper rifles (if you attach a scope to it), making it a do-everything gun, while still using a very common ammunition. Basically, having an upgraded AK, enough ammo and maybe a backup shotgun is more than enough to beat the game.
<ul><li> Speaking of shotguns, the Armsel in <em>Call of Pripyat</em> is one of the most powerful general-purpose bullet-spitters in the whole game. It's unstoppable with the right mods (particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">the full-auto</a> upgrade) and anything that isn't a Chimera, a Pseudogiant, or a goon in an Exoskeleton will die quickly before it, and shotgun shells are dirt cheap. The only issue is the strenuous reload. How do you get one? You can either get one in the first area by doing some artifact-hunting for a couple hours and buying one from Nimble, or get one in the second area by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">shooting the Bandit leader Jack in the face</a> and swiping his.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Many of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>'s stock weapons are, in fact, the best ones. Some unlockables are more useful than the stock weaponry, but obtaining them either requires unlocking achievements, trading them between other players, crafting them, or getting a lucky random drop. This means that many of the stock weapons are the Infinity -1 sword for their respective class. For example, take the Scout: he rarely uses his Bat by default- the Scattergun does far more damage at close range. The Atomizer gives the scout the opportunity to triple jump while wielding any weapon (costing 10 hp each time) at the cost of dealing less damage, which rarely, if ever, matters. The Sandman reduces the scouts health by 15 but gives him the opportunity to launch a ball that can stun foes- unlocking it requires the player to get several Scout achievements.

<ul><li> There are a lot more powerful swords available in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> than Griswold's Edge - but those are all random drops, whereas Griswold's Edge is guaranteed if you get the right quest, and it does do decent damage and knock back enemies. In addition, its additional damage is fire damage, which is the only energy type that's of any use in the final level.
<ul><li> Regular magic weapons in the original Diablo carry over into new game +, while unique weapons do not.

<ul><li> The Chicago Typewriter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRisingChopTillYouDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRisingChopTillYouDrop">Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop</a></em> is easier to get than the Mega Buster, and can take out any boss you can use it on with less than a clip's worth of ammo.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series, the shotgun tends to fit nicely into this role. While not as powerful as the magnum or grenade launcher, and definitely no rocket launcher, it tends to be obtained fairly early in the game and with minimal fuss, with high enough damage output and plentiful enough ammo to become your staple weapon and allow you to take on hunters, lickers, and the Nemesis.
<ul><li> The Infinite Rocket Launcher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>. Costs the same as the Chicago Typewriter, useless up close due to it being explosive, and a worse firing rate than the other two secret weapons. But at the same time, all you need to do to get it is beat the game once. Assignment Ada and the Mercenaries minigames are required if you want to get the other two guns and that will take up at least <em>some</em> time, and it sure makes all those bosses you fought before much easier to kill. Many of the standard guns can also become this. After upgrading them full you get an exclusive upgrade that gives the Striker a magazine of <em>100 rounds</em> for example. Another good example is the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Red9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Red9">Red 9</a>, which gains a very high firepower, together with a stock making it steady and as it's available early on, you will probably have upgraded it fully once you reach the end. As it's a handgun you will never have to worry about ammo either.
<ul><li> Infinite rocket launchers from the prior games are shoulder-fired and won't let you aim them up or down, meaning you can't really use them as your only weapon because they aren't able to hit small, quick enemies like crows and dogs. The launcher from the 2002 REmake, however, fires off the hip and lets you aim up or down as you please, making it an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> instead.
</li></ul></li><li> You will find many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> players using an infinite rocket launcher rather than a rifle, which is even less useful, because if you miss (and if you're on chapter 3-3, you will), you either have to wait for the weapon to re-scope or blind-fire it. Also, many people use the SIG 556, an assault rifle with lower firepower but a higher capacity than the AK-74 (but the capacity becomes moot when you unlock infinite ammo), and the "Lightning Hawk", which is the weakest magnum, is middle in capacity, but has the highest reload speed (again, a moot point when you have infinite ammo). Both of these guns have to do with recoil, which is not measured by the game. The M3 is the Infinity Minus One Sword of shotguns: it <em>technically</em> has lower firepower than the Hydra (M3 has 900, but the Hydra has 550 for each of the three barrels it fires), but has the benefit of not blocking your field of vision when you aim it with Chris.
<ul><li> Give the best magnum to the computer controlled character, because they will never miss. Keep the lesser magnums for yourself because they reload faster and have less recoil.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, Tech 2 weapons are these. At first glance they seem to be the top weapons in the game and require that players train a whole upper tier of skills to use effectively, but they are not the best damage dealers when compared to rare officer-modified Tech 1 weapons. The top level officer weapons are quite a bit more devastating, but they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">extremely rare</a> to find and thus cripplingly expensive to buy from other players in the game. The Tech 2 weapons also have the advantage of being able to use Tech 2 specialty ammunition that can boost range, weapon accuracy, and damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>, the <a class="urllink" href="http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Frozen_seal_spine">frozen seal spine<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is significantly stronger than other weapons that you can get at level eight, easily obtainable, heals and restores MP every turn, and can be dual-wielded. Only Seal Clubbers can take advantage, but it's more beneficial to them than even to other classes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> the Silver Sword of Gith definitely qualifies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Cool Sword</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyShapedSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyShapedSword">Oddly Shaped Sword</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>. But it's entirely possible to forge and enchant weapons on your own that have it beat on damage output. Two factors are to blame: A, the weapon has no type, so your weapon skills feats have no effect on it whatsoever. B, the Sword is incomplete (there are still chunks missing). It is far deadlier when it reappears in <em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>, though still crippled by having no type.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a> has the </em>The Godsword, a level 75 two-handed sword which can be fitted with one of four different hilts, each one giving the weapon a different special attack. It is the highest levelled non-degrading melee weapon in the game, and is widely used in player-killing because of its array of special attacks.
<ul><li> There's also the level 70 Abyssal Whip, which was for many years the most effective weapon in the entire game for a large variety of popular tasks, until Dungeoneering introduced the aforementioned Chaotic weaponry. One advantage of the abyssal whip is that it is tradeable, unlike Chaotic weaponry, and costs far less than many other tradeable weapons of similar level, not to mention it does not degrade unlike stronger weapons. That being said, the Abyssal whip is still one of the more effective options for those without the Dungeoneering requirements for Chaotic weapons, or a big enough wallet to afford the up-front or upkeep costs of level 90 weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> Quel'Delar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>: Wrath of the Lich King</em>. It was the best level 80 weapon you could get without ever going to a raid or the arena (and better than weapons from the lesser raids), and as a bonus comes in different versions for different characters.
<ul><li> Basically any weapon weapon drop in raids where one could also find material for comparable legendary weapons - while the material for legendary weapons was limited and it took weeks if not months to complete just *one* item, one only needed a single final boss kill and some luck to get a slightly worse weapon (the exception being the legendaries in TBC that actually were little more than exceedingly rare boss drops).

Oh. There's also comes in four copies. All of which can be bought from the same blacksmith. While there are at least two swords out that that are way more destructive, one of them is two-handed and the other is cursed, and comes with ridiculously huge penalties.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Pyrotechnic Axe</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Arcanum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Arcanum">Arcanum</a></em> for any Tech-oriented melee character. It can be crafted in the first major city with minimal effort if your character is trained in Smithing (or you recruit Magnus), deals a ton of bonus fire damage and doesn't suffer from weapon degradation when attacking rock monsters (which come up a lot in the game).

</li><li> The silver vorpal sword also sees a lot of use: the enchantment level is sub-par, but it's good enough for anything except bosses and the chance for an insta-kill isn't to be sneezed at. You only get it in chapter six, however, so whether it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> or Infinity Minus One Sword depends on how much of the game you did back in chapter two. In <em>Throne of Bhaal</em> it is a definite Infinity Minus One Sword, however, since you start the game with it and it has a chance to instantly kill any non-boss enemy.
</li></ul></li><li> In the iPhone game <em>Battleheart</em>, you can get this by upgrading a weapon to the max for a Tier 7. (Well, that would actually be a Infinity Minus Two Sword as you can get Tier 8s from the arena) The Infinity Plus One Sword is unlocked by doing extremely well in the arena.

Umbra &mdash; provided you can find and kill the Orc who wields it, Magebane &mdash; a glass claymore which lies within the Urshilaku burial and can be taken with just a telekinesis or levitate spell, and the Scourge mace, which lies in one of the main quest destinations and only needs a powerful unlock scroll and bit of stealth skill to get. Alternatively, once you've leveled enough, you can simply kill monsters in shrines or in the Grazelands until you find a Daedric sword, or you can train your Conjuration skill so you can summon Daedric swords all the time.

</li><li> If you're after paralyzation effects, you might as well get the Daedric Crescent, which has the same enchantment, packs a wallop, and looks much more cool. You do have to kill the guy who wields it to get it, though.
</li><li> The shack in the corner of the Dren Plantation, where lurks a guy with a Daedric Daikatana, the most powerful unenchanted weapon in the game... right from the beginning of the game, requiring no quests, and only enough levelling (or skill) to shank the guy. Actually enchanting one of these can take it up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> status.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> <strong>Armor:</strong>
</li><li> Dragonplate Armor. Daedric Armor is strictly better, but the materials to make it include Ebony Ingots (expensive unless you know where to look) and Daedra Hearts (rare). Much easier to get Dragonplate, since it uses those Dragon Bones and Dragon Scales you've been saving up all game. Also, there's a point at which the extra armor points for daedric don't matter because damage reduction is capped at 667 AR, which isn't too hard to get.
</li><li> For efficiency's sake, there is a perk which greatly boosts the effectiveness of Dwarven armor to just under that of Daedric, and the smithing perk for Dwarven gear is one of the first in the tree. The only issue then are the weapons.
</li><li> In fact with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">enough skill, perks, and Fortify Smithing bonuses from potions and enchantments,</a> pretty much any armor set can hit the 80% damage reduction cap, which coupled with perks that reduce encumbrance for your preferred armor type, make it so that you can wear whatever armor you want with only cosmetic differences.
</li><li> Until you max out your smithing and enchanting skills, the Shrouded Armor / Thieves' Guild armor are this for stealthy light armor users, and you can get them very early into the Dark Brotherhood or Thieves' Guild quest lines respectively.
</li><li> <strong>Weapons:</strong>
</li><li> Skyforge Steel will serve you well for the majority of the game, and you can get a Skyforge Steel Sword for free in the second town (and purchase Skyforge Steel versions of whatever weapon you prefer for a reasonable price).
</li><li> The Ebony Blade is this for anyone who uses greatswords and isn't too strong in Enchanting. While its damage is relatively subpar (nothing skill and smithing can't fix), it's the lightest greatsword of the game and comes with a nifty Life Drain enchantment that can be enhanced and is <em>infinite</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4xjtz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4xjtz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4xjtz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Save for another weapon, all weapon enchantments are limited in time and must be recharged</span>. Obtaining it will take you 15 minutes tops (a bit longer if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Balgruuf is no longer jarl</span>) and it's in a familiar place (Dragonsreach) the only prerequisites being a level 20 character and the innkeeper of Whiterun must be still alive.
</li><li> Bound weapons (summoned, ethereal daedric blades and bows) aren't quite top-tier, but they're weightless, can't be stolen, lost, or disarmed, never need to be recharged, and level the Conjuration skill. Their cost (both in gold to learn the spell and magicka to cast it) is very reasonable and they can be bought or found quite early in the game. Many characters will never use anything else, and for convenience, they can't be beat.
</li><li> With the enchanting and alchemy fortification going back and forth... any weapon/armor can become like this and may even reach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> status if kept at it enough times.
</li><li> If you have the Dawnguard DLC, Crossbows are extremely easy to get (either by joining the Dawnguard and doing one really easy sidequest, or just straight up killing a Dawnguard member) and even the basic crossbow has stats that are superior to every other bow except named ones and the Dragonbone Bow (the strongest bow in the game). If you further follow up with the quest, the Enhanced Dwarven Crossbow is basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">infinity plus one bow</a> in the game in terms of raw damage, and it's <em>four tiers stronger than the basic Crossbow</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> The hunting rifle and its unique version, Ol' Painless, qualify. Solid, dependable, capable of ludicrous accuracy, common drops for repair and some of the most common ammo in the wasteland. Sure, it's no Alien Blaster or Gatling laser, but the enemy is just as dead.
</li><li> If you have an Average or better Science skill, the Scoped .44 Magnum can be found in the Chryslus Building near the main quest's first subway station, although its ammo is less common. The quest to obtain the unique Blackhawk version can also be done rather early.
</li><li> For melee characters, the Shishkebab (a homemade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Sword</a>) can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">created within the first few levels</a>. The schematics are available for purchase at one of the traveling caravans for a reasonable price or as a quest reward for an easy early side quest that's not hard to stumble onto, and the ingredients aren't terribly difficult to find either. It starts out superior to the baseball bats and pool cues you're likely to be using at the time, and with the proper perks and upgrades it continues to be useful through the entire game. The only melee weapon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">that out-damages it</a> is a unique variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainSword">Ripper</a> called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Jack</a>, which can only be found in a cave infested with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">deathclaws</a> in an out-of-the-way corner where it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">unlikely to be discovered by chance</a>. But Jack degrades quickly and can only be repaired by cannibalizing the incredibly rare standard Ripper for parts or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney">spending hard-earned caps at a merchant</a>, rendering it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>; even those who prefer it are well-advised to keep a Shishkebab around as a backup in case it breaks down in the middle of a long quest.
</li><li> The Combat Armor is the apparel equivalent of this. Unlike the previous two games where you obtain it after the Leather and Metal Armors, in <em>3</em> you can find it randomly generated at Craterside Supply&#151;<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">the first store in the game</a></em>&#151;after only a couple visits. Once you get to Rivet City, you can find Combat Armors in bulk quantities for repairing, as well dozens on the backs of dead Talon Company mercenaries. Even when you do finally gain the ability to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, most of the varieties you find offer negligible increases in resistance and are much heavier, with drops in movement speed and inventory that aren't worth it. Without the DLCs, chances are you'll end up beating the game in it.
</li><li> Not only that, but if you complete the side quest involving Reilly's Rangers with all 3 members still intact, you get to choose between either the Ranger Battle Armor or a special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">minigun</a>. Most players end up taking the Ranger Armor because it's essentially the best non-Power Armor in the game due to it raising many defensive stats for the player and they can easily pickpocket the special minigun from one of the NPCs in their headquarters. Furthermore, unlike the Power Armor, the Ranger Armor can easily be repaired by the more common Combat Armor, at least until they get training to wear Power Armor.
</li><li> The Victory Sniper Rifle, while significantly weaker than the Gauss Rifle from <em>Operation Anchorage</em>, has the same effect of knocking down the enemy upon a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of which, the <em>Operation Anchorage</em> Gauss Rifle. While its long firing and reload time makes it worse in close combat and its reliance on merchants and alien epoxy to repair it are major drawbacks its very high base damage and super-high <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> (which it always gets with the Finesse Perk) is very useful against the unfairly tough DLC enemies such as Swampfolk, Super Mutant Overlords, Feral Ghoul Revers, and Albino Radscorpions as the high damage and Knockdown effect means less shots to kill them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The <em>Dead Money</em> DLC has the holorifle, the third most damaging energy weapon in the game behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Gauss Rifle</a> and its unique variant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">YCS/186</a>. The holorifle can load four shots (the gauss rifle and YCS are single-shot), only uses one unit of ammo per shot (compared to five and four), can be modded so that it almost never needs repairs, and it's dropped into your inventory as soon as you begin the DLC.
</li><li> For sniper fans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> the Anti-Materiel Rifle is the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of sniping. Accurate, hits like the fist of God and can set things on fire with the right ammo. However, it's fragile, only available at later levels, expensive to buy and fire, and the strength requirements are hard to meet. The Gobi Campaign Scout Rifle, while slightly less damaging, uses inexpensive, easily-available .308 ammo, is actually usable in VATS, more durable, less restrictive in terms of required stats and skills, 3 times lighter <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">available at about level 8 or so if you know what you're doing</a>.
</li><li> Likewise for the COS Silenced Sniper Rifle from <em>Old World Blues</em>, which can be easily picked up just outside the location "Little Yangzte", it even spawns some mooks for target practice.
</li><li> The Ratslayer is essentially a unique Varmint Rifle with all of the modifications installed (extended magazine, scope, silencer). What makes it stand out from its more powerful counterparts that you will eventually come across later on is its obscenely high critical hit chance multiplier of x5. This means that you will be able to score multiple critical hits at a particular target even with a low Luck stat. Combined with Sneak Attack Critical hits, the Finesse and Better Criticals perks, and [optionally] the Built To Destroy trait, you will be able to one-shot kill anything below Deathclaw level. Also, with the Jury Rigging perk, you can simply repair it with any two-handed non-automatic ballistic gun such as the aforementioned Varmint Rifle. Add to the fact that it uses the rather common 5.56mm ammo and chances are this will be your most used sniper rifle throughout the game. The thing is, the gun itself is located in a cave full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Rats</a> and somewhat leaking of radiation, which can be rather troublesome for low to mid-level players.
</li><li> Maria, Benny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingBlingBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingBlingBang">unique</a> Browning Hi-Power, can be acquired at the halfway point in the main quest (which can be very fast, depending on how quickly you get to New Vegas). It fires 9mm ammo, which is extremely common especially at the beginning of the game, making it likely that you'll have a small stockpile of rounds (and non-unique versions of the extremely common 9mm pistol to repair it with) by the time you find it. It has excellent damage for a handgun, a high rate of fire, good accuracy for most gunfights, and high durability. Once you get Maria, you can spend a good portion of the game never needing another sidearm, and the commonality and cheapness of the ammo and replacement parts allows for it to be used as a primary weapon in some battles. Game mods that increase the damage of weapons to realistic levels and make even a common 9mm deadly will turn Maria into a powerhouse.
</li><li> The .44 Magnum is an excellent high damage pistol in the mid-late game, although quite a bit weaker than the hunting revolver which uses .45-70 govt ammo. However, the magnum has many advantages over the hunting revolver: it comes with 6 chambers where the hunting revolver requires an upgrade to go from 5 chambers to 6, the magnum is much more durable and won't wear out as quickly (and has an upgrade to increase its durability even more while the hunting revolver does not get one), magnum rounds are much more common to find or buy, the magnum can be kept hidden on your person when you go into a casino while bigger guns including the hunting revolver cannot be hidden, and finally the .44 magnum takes far fewer action points in V.A.T.S. to fire.
</li><li> Get to Vegas, kill a few Fiends and take their shoddy Tri-Beam laser rifles. Repair them into one good rifle, and with a good Energy Weapons skill you can easily do 100+ points damage per shot. It's a bit expensive on ammo (3 beams - 3 charges) but you'll be doing a lot of one-hit kills, so it evens out.
</li><li> The Blade of the West in <em>Lonesome Road</em> is a literal Infinity Minus One Sword, being a slightly weaker but faster version of the Blade of the East, which can only be obtained from a unique enemy after the main game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>.
</li><li> And lastly, you can find a near-broken Fat Man carried by a dead super mutant master in a Nopah Cave, southeast of Chance's Map. What makes this better is the mutant respawns every few days and dies on one shot from almost anything making this an easier way to grind for Fat Mans to sell.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a>:</em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Spray N' Pray</a>, a unique submachine gun that deals an extra 15 points of explosive damage in an area of effect. It can be purchased relatively cheaply (under 3000 caps) from a wandering merchant and comes with most of the really useful upgrades already, like a fast-reload drum magazine, high-powered receiver for maximum damage, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSilencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSilencer">suppressor</a>, allowing for <em>triple</em> damage if both are maxed out. As it's both an automatic weapon and an explosive weapon it gains damage boosts from both perks. Its only real disadvantages are its lack of accuracy at long range and the rate at which it burns through ammunition (it only takes a few seconds fire to burn through a full 100 round ammo drum).
</li><li> Several mundane weapons can be very damaging if you fully upgrade them at workbenches and take a few levels in the relevant perks. For example, the Laser Rifle, Combat Shotgun and .44 Pistol can all do over 150 damage at maximum power. For context, 150 is the base damage of the Missile Launcher. Level locking of skills and perks prevents a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a> scenario.
</li><li> The Laser Musket you get in the first town you enter at the start of the game can eventually be upgraded to do over 300 damage per shot, and it runs on basic fusion cells. It's perfectly serviceable as either a rifle, a sniper rifle, or a shotgun/blunderbuss, though the long reload isn't for everyone.
</li><li> At first, the Righteous Authority is really nothing special - it's just a laser rifle with a unique mod, right? Not quite. That mod, combined with a high luck build, easily pushes the laser rifle into relevance past the level 30, until you can get some of the later science mods. It's available basically from the start of the game, as, while the side quest might be a bit out of your level range, you're escorted by a man in power armor. You also encounter so much ammunition for the laser rifle on that side quest that you'll probably never want for ammo again.

</li><li> Shandor's Darkstaff in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny">Sonny</a> 2</em>. It can be acquired as a random drop from the boss of the third area, meaning it comes before the annoying fourth area and the very difficult fifth area. It gives tremendously large boosts to Speed, Instinct, and Vitality all at once - so large that any one of the boosts it provides are often more than the rest of your equipment at the time combined. And if Sonny is running a Strength-based setup, you can simply give the Darkstaff to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Veradux</a>, who will make tremendously good use of it.

Then all you need to do is reforge it...
<ul><li> <em>Boktai 3</em> has the La Vie En Rose. It levels up with you and steadily gains power as you do, has a devastating 5 hit combo, never breaks or blunts (very few swords in the game don't), and can be obtained <em>practically at the very start of the game</em>. The only thing keeping this from being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is that, when compared to other weapons at it's (current) level, it is comparably weak.

</li><li> Ditto for the Spectral Swallow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>, for the same reasons.

The Metal King set of equipment is typically the strongest equipment in the games they are in, but are often relegated to difficult sidequests, long chains of alchemy, or bought with large amounts of casino tokens. The legendary equipment, which is often only slightly weaker and sometimes have unique traits the Metal King set lacks, is usually given out by the plot. Furthermore, said legendary equipment is usually unique to the main character, whereas several characters can typically use Metal King equipment, so oftentimes is is better to keep the hero in their legendary equipment and give the strongest equipment to the next best character instead.

The Kikuichimonji and Tisiphone Edge are classed as "light blades", meaning the only people in your party who CAN'T wield them are the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> Mia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagicianGirl">Black Magician Girl</a> Sheba, while the Excalibur has a 5% chance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">being forged from the rarest forgeable material in the game</a>, and has the potential to do more damage than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>.
<ul><li> They are, however, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> weapons of choice for Ivan and Jenna, who can't use heavier equipment.
</li><li> Excalibur and its evil twin, the Darksword, can serve as this for Isaac and Felix. Overall they're less powerful than the Sol Blade <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6y45g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6y45g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6y45g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the Darksword actually has higher base attack, but a weaker unleash, while Excalibur's unleash can potentially outdamage the Sol Blade's but only has a 60% chance of tripling damage compared to the Sol Blade's 100%, making it less reliable in the long run</span>, but you can't get that until halfway through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, while the forged weapons can be obtained almost immediately after completing Jupiter Lighthouse if the player knows what they're doing.
</li><li> The Nebula Wand is the Infinity -1 staff for Mia. She is not meant to cause damage, so a water-elemental unleash that also restores her PP will serve her better than any of the alternatives.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em>, the Levatine is the better weapon for Tyrell in practice than the above mentioned Excalibur and Darksword even though it's significantly weaker due to the changes in the unleash system. The Verdant Sword is much easier to obtain than the Tisiphone Edge, and when equipped on Karis in her base class line its power can potentially be doubled because it's powered up by the user's Jupiter power. Rief will get more use out of the Clotho's Distaff than any other end-game weapon since every attack will have a chance to restore his PP and he's not meant to cause physical damage. Despite being only the third strongest light blade, the Masamune may serve Amiti better than the others due to the already powerful Rising Dragon unleash running off his high Mercury power and being capable of affecting multiple targets. The only superior option is obtained in the bonus dungeon after the final boss has been defeated.
</li><li> The Gaia Blade serves as this in both <em>The Lost Age</em> and <em>Dark Dawn</em>. In the former, it's the previous game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> and is what Isaac is certain to be packing when he rejoins the party late in <em>The Lost Age</em>. It's still very powerful, synergizes well with Isaac's Venus alignment due to being directly boosted by the wielder's Venus power, and can only be safely replaced with the weapons mentioned above. In <em>Dark Dawn</em>, Matthew finds it about three quarters through the game, and it's gotten an attack buff since Isaac's era; once again, it stands well above anything you will reasonably have at that point, and can only be safely replaced by the Sol Blade.
</li></ul></li><li> The Seraphic Weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>. They're only useful for the element they correspond to, and mostly only for fights where you can exploit elemental weaknesses, but they're comparatively easier to obtain and upgrade than the Infinity Plus One Swords such as the Bahamut or Xeno weapons.
</li><li> If you farm Ashas (The tentacled shell enemies) in the Moth Forest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeCocoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeCocoon">Jade Cocoon</a></em>, they'll eventually drop a Nightglow sword. It has a high chance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">poisoning an enemy</a>, which drains 1/10 of a monster's max hit points per turn, reduces their attack and defense, <em>and</em> can even be inflicted on bosses (Provided they don't use poison themselves, then they're immune). Although it's weak, you'll use it for the rest of the game since you can just land a blow or two as Levant to poison the enemy, then whip out one of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">mons</a> to do the rest. <em>And you can get this sword less than half-way through the game...</em>

It's technically not quite as good as the maxed out Challenge Hammer (160 vs 165 extra attack power respectively), but it's far, far more practical to use due to one minor catch... To max out the Golden Hammer, you just need to be holding a lot of money. To max out the Challenge Hammer? You need to beat ALL the Expert Challenges. Which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> to the nth degree and damn near impossible in some cases. Oh, and to get the Golden Hammer? You merely have to complete SOME Expert Challenges, which means that using the Challenge one in comparison to it means doing about 30-50 MORE challenges than are needed to get the Golden Hammer!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth">Nocturne: Rebirth</a></em> has the Roshule Sword for Reviel and the Wind Spirit spear for Luna, which are their best non-sorcerous weapons. The former is obtained via the story while the latter is obtained by beating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shylphiel</span> at level 32 or lower. Unlike most examples, these two weapons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Swords</a>, which drain the wielders' HP.
</li><li> All the "plus ones" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> are obtained by weapon-fusing very high level (the lowest one is 73) Personas, many of which require maxed out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5">Social Links</a> to create and are often complicated 5 or 6-way fusions. There are a few special weapons that, while nowhere near as powerful, are much easier to obtain.
<ul><li> The Gae Bolg is obtained by weapon fusing Cu Chulainn, a Lv 40 Persona that doesn't require any Social Links to be completed. It has 260 ATK, far more than anything obtainable at that point. It's only weakness is dealing Wind element damage, making it useless against enemies immune to Wind.
</li><li> Mjolnir, Laevatein and Balmung are obtained by weapon fusing Thor, Surt and Siegfried respectively. While all three <em>do</em> require maxed Social Links, they're among the easier links to max out and all are obtainable at a comparatively low level. All weapons have 300 power, putting them on the level of most endgame ones. Mjolnir and Laevatein have the same issue as the Gae Bolg, dealing elemental damage, but overall they're still very good weapons for the time they're available.
</li><li> On the higher end, Deus Xiphos is only slightly weaker than the ultimate sword, Lucifer's Blade (both have 450 power, Lucifer's Blade gives +10 to all stats while Deus Xiphos only give +10 to Magic). It requires weapon fusing Michael, a Lv 75 Judgement Persona who doesn't require a special fusion or any maxed Social Links, while Lucifer's Blade requires, well, Lucifer, who's a complicated fusion of multiple high-tier Personas in the low to mid 80's, including one that requires the Star Social Link to be maxed out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> has several weapons only available on Christmas Eve from the Airsoft Shop, shortly before the party enters the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a> leading to the final battle. They may not be as powerful as weapons created by itemizing Personas, but they can be purchased en masse as opposed to only one itemization per in-game day, and do not require the player to have fused the prerequisite Persona.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> <em>Royal,</em> the Lucifer Persona is this compared to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satanael,</span> who can only be fused in New Game+. Lucifer is still a beast by himself though: immune to physical and gun attacks, resistant to four different elements, drains Curse, naturally learns skills to cover his Bless weakness and has a trait which cuts the cost of magic attacks by 75%. He is the most powerful Persona one can fuse during their first playthrough.
<ul><li> Satan can, in turn, be considered this to Lucifer himself. Compared to Lucifer, Satan only resists Gun and repels a couple elements, and his trait only reduces the cost of Ice attacks. On the other hand, fusing Lucifer not only requires maxing out the Star confidant (which requires max knowledge), but Justice and Moon as well, since the ultimate Personas of those Arcanas are needed to fuse him, with one being required just to get the other, as well as many other high-level Personas, making his fusion rather expensive and complicated. Satan, by contrast, has no weaknesses, still has plenty powerful skills, can be summoned by regular fusion, and is unlocked by completing the plot-mandated Judgement confidant.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Every main series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> game has these. In addition to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">base-stat-680 "boxart legendaries"</a> that every game features, which can often only be caught in the post-game, every generation also introduces a "legendary trio" of Pok&eacute;mon, all with a base stat total of 580, not quite as powerful as other legendaries, but easily outstripping all but a handful of fully-evolved Pok&eacute;mon, and which can be caught at a much earlier stage in the game.
<ul><li> Articuno, Moltres, and Zapdos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red, Blue and Yellow</a></em>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remakes</a> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>.

</li><li> Regirock, Regice, and Registeel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</a></em>.
</li><li> Azelf, Uxie, and Mesprit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pok&eacute;mon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</a></em>.
</li><li> Terrakion, Virizion, and Cobalion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em>. (Tornadus and Thundurus have the same base stat total, but cannot be found as early).
</li><li> There are also the starter Pok&eacute;mon, as in the first Pok&eacute;mon you get at the beginning of the games. Not only do you get them without much effort but they are also very unlikely to ever leave your party. The reason that a player would be hard-pressed to ditch the starter Pok&eacute;mon is because such Pok&eacute;mon have respectable stats and also gain access to powerful moves exclusive to them later on in the game. It is not unheard of people beating the games with their starter and a band of low-level HM slaves.
</li><li> Then there are the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> mons. With a stat total often in the mid-500's, evolve in the 20's or with another way that can be exploited to get them easier, they are a staple of many teams and remain useful even when the legendaries come into play.
</li><li> Finally, there are Pseudo-Legendaries - Extremely powerful Pok&eacute;mon with three-stage evolutionary lines, a base stat total of 600, and (usually) are Dragon-typed or otherwise fierce looking that evolve at high levels. Most, if not all of them are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> mons, with extremely weak base stages (often with almost nonexistent learnsets and TM options) that evolve very late into their secondary stages.
<ul><li> The first evolutionary line, Dratini, Dragonair and Dragonite, were the first and only Dragon-types in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em>. However, unlike later Pseudo-Legendaries, Dragonite was cute and whimsical in appearance rather than fearsome. Among its fellow Pseudo-Legendaries, it was once a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> with all-around good stats with slightly higher physical attacking power, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> made it into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em> introduced Larvitar, Pupitar, and Tyranitar, set the trend of Pseudo-Legendaries being vicious-looking in their final stages - which is rather strange considering the general trend for Second Gen Pok&eacute;mon was being cute. It starts off as a Rock/Ground type, but Tyranitar, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, is a Rock/Dark type, and focuses around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">taking hits from faster enemies and ripping through enemies in return.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> introduced <em>two</em> lines - the first is the Bagon, Shelgon and Salamence line. Basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a> of the Dragonite and Tyranitar lines, it has Dragonite's typing with Tyranitar's fierce nature, and sacrifices the former's defenses for greater speed.
</li><li> The other Third Gen Pseudo-Legendary line, Beldum, Metang, and Metagross, is the odd one out of the Pseudo-Legendaries. A Steel/Psychic-type line, Metagross resembles a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderTank">Spider Tank</a>. It's also the first Pseudo-Legendary line without a dual weakness to any type. Much like Tyranitar, it relies more on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">its defenses</a> to let it hold up in a fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> introduced one of the most infamous Pseudo-Legendaries: the Gible, Gabite and Garchomp line. These Dragon/Ground-types were based on the concept of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandShark">Land Shark</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Its outrageously high offenses and speed, as well as surprisingly good defenses and great offensive typing</a> led it it swiftly being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> to the unofficial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Uber tier</a>.
</li><li> Perhaps to compliment Tyranitar's affiliation with Godzilla, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em> introduced Deino, Zweilous and Hydreigon. Hydreigon, a Dark/Dragon-type, is obviously based on Godzilla's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, King Ghidorah. Unlike most Pseudo-Legendaries, it excels at Special Attack rather than physical (though its physical Attack is nothing to take lightly). Its great movepool allows it high versatility (it can learn offensive moves from all types but the Grass-type) to perform well at taking out a variety of foes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em> introduces a rather strange Pseudo-Legendary, in the form of Goomy, Sliggoo, and Goodra. These unusual Dragon-types are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Blob Monsters</a>, but, fitting for their basis, learn plenty of Water-type moves, can heal off status effects in the rain, and only fully evolve in an area that's raining. What's even more unusual is that the line's highest stat is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Special Defense</a>- most Psuedo-Legendaries have an offensive stat as their highest. They're also very friendly and cute (Goomy in particular is quite popular), ending a trend of fearsome psuedo-legendaries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em> introduces the Jangmo-o line, Fighting/Dragon critters that use weaponized scales to battle. The final form, Kommo-o, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">fairly well-rounded stats</a>, with Defense being its highest and a slightly higher Attack.
</li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em> comes the debut of the Dreepy line, a series of Dragon/Ghost-types based on the prehistoric reptile <em>Diplocaulus</em> combined with a stealth bomber. Dragapult, Dreepy's final evolution, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">the highest Speed of all pseudo-legendaries, high attack stats, and relatively low defenses</a>, giving it great use as a sweeper. Design-wise, the line occupies a space somewhere between Goodra and Hydreigon, being cute, bizarre-looking, and a little intimidating.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition, <em>Sun and Moon</em> also introduce Wishiwashi, a small, non-legendary Water-Type critter with an absurdly low 175 BST... that, starting at level 20, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicallyUnusualClass">mimics</a> evolution by automatically transforming into it's much stronger School Forme upon entering the field. At 620, School Forme Wishiwashi has a higher BST than the aforementoined Pseudo-Legendaries, and in fact it is stronger than any of Alola's <em>actual</em> Legendary Pok&eacute;mon except the two cover Legendaries.
</li><li> And as far as <em>moves</em> go, people tend to gravitate towards attacks with a base power between 75 and 95, even though nearly every type in the game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7bo0d');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7bo0d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7bo0d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dark is the exception</span> has at least one easily obtainable move whose power is well beyond 100.

</li><li> Generation IV gave love to some relatively powerless pokemon through the medium of evolutions, quickly boosting them up to have base stat totals ranging from 510-545, which is on par with most starters and feature useful movesets the only downside being the aversion-based methods of obtaining said pokemon that vary from generation to generation, ranging from trade with an item you find in-world, or racking up points in the challenging post game battle arena. Notable examples include: Roserade - the evolution to Roselia, which hits like a freight train with its absurd Special Attack despite its lack of physical defenses; Electivire, Electabuzz's evolved form, the single strongest non-legendary or Mega Evolved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Electric</a>-type Pok&eacute;mon when it comes both to base stat total and second strongest in attack; Magmortar, which evolves from Magmar, and can decimate its enemies with its amazing Special Attack; and finally, Togekiss, Togetic's evolution, whose nice defenses, brutal Special Attack, decent Speed and large moveset make it one of the best Pok&eacute;mon around even despite its horrible physical Attack stat.

So some just settle for weapons that work like the Eternal Sword, like the Mystic Sword and Gaia Clever. Or the easy to get Last Fencer which is the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> in every aspect <em>but</em> sheer power...

While the coliseum prize weapons and the ones you can forge in Din's Shop may be statistically inferior, you can get them pretty much as soon as you unlock the coliseum (depending on your mastery of the battle system or what your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> bonuses are) or get your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship">Global Airship</a> working, both of which happen reasonably early in the game.

While it's not substantially stronger than other weapons even at the time you get it, and quickly becomes beaten by even store-bought weapons in sheer power, one of its abilities is Accelerate, which reduces attack lag. The sheer speed of this weapon makes infinite combos possible, and even without them, this speed makes it far more useful than the brute force of the later weapons. The only other weapon in the game that has Accelerate is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Nether Traitor</a>, so most players will be using the Echo Tracer for a long, long time.
<ul><li> Also from the same game is Marta's War Chariot. This can be acquired right around the same time as the Echo Tracer, and has the effect of randomly casting Fire Ball every time Marta attacks. Note that Marta's standard combo on the ground can be up to <em>nine hits</em>, the fireballs come out immediately from wherever she is straight to the enemy and with no cost whatsoever, based on her magic stat (which, considering she's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a>, means they will be <em>very strong</em>), and there's nothing stopping Marta from getting multiple fireball casts in one combo. Comically, this means that the best way to deal damage with Marta (before you get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Speed Cast 3</a>, anyway) is to have her swing at empty air. There are two other weapons with similar instant-cast effects, but the Energy Arc requires a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Philosopher's Stone</a> to make, while the Millstone is found in a chest in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>. Another possible Infinity-1 Weapon for Marta is the Trick Bind, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Kismet</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">so hard to get</a>; it has the second highest magic attack power of her weapons, and its Concentrate 2 trait makes it harder for enemies to interrupt her spells.

It will get outclassed later, but even then it remains a nice suit to give to some of your other pilots.
</li><li> The dragoon armors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em> are unusual in that they're acquired considerably later in the game than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorOfInvincibility">best armor</a>: the Armor of Legend and Legend Casque. The dragoon armors negate damage of the wearer's element, have decent all around defenses, and aren't particularly expensive. The Armor of Legend and Legend Casque have over twice as much defense as the next best armor and offer a 50% chance for either magic or physical attacks against the wearer to miss completely. However, each only has defense for physical or magic (Armor and Casque respectively) and provides no defense to the other, also each costs ten thousand gold in a game where most enemies drop a couple hundred at best. In the time it takes to farm the sixty thousand gold needed for just the main party, players will likely have considerably out-leveled the final boss.
<ul><li> When it comes to attacks, each character (except Rose and Kongol) has an Addition that deals impressive damage while also giving a reasonable amount of Spirit Points<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9sl3o');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9sl3o" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9sl3o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Crush Dance for Dart, Hammer Spin for Meru, Rod Typhoon for Lavitz/Albert, and 5 Ring Shattering for Haschel</span>. While weaker than their final Additions, said Additions are great for fighting bosses while leveling up the others on random encounters.

Probably the straightest example, however, is the Rune-Covered Trident, a guaranteed artifact given as a reward for a particular side quest. It has excellent damage stats, slays demons and undead, grants several useful intrinsics, and gives a hefty boost to Dexterity. The only downside is that characters not born under the Raven star sign get it at level 36, by which point it might not be so impressive. Raven-born characters, however, get it at <em>level 16</em>.

It gives the user 2-5 hits of a standard Grass-type attack in a row while working at a distance in a straight line, making most boss fights an absolute joke, even though most of the game's bosses resist or double-resist Grass-type attacks. And it&#146;s obtainable pretty much as soon as you start getting TM&#146;s, roughly around the time of the fourth dungeon from shops and rescue rewards (it's available as of the sixth dungeon onward as a random drop, which is still pretty early). And that&#146;s even if you don&#146;t use Wonder Mail to just generate it as a custom rescue reward, which you can do right after the completion of the second dungeon. While there are better attacks available late-game or to certain evolution lines, Bullet Seed is prolific, easily obtainable, and exceptionally powerful while being available to many of the game's starter and partner Pok&eacute;mon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>'s strongest artifacts, such as the undead- and demon-slaying silver saber Grayswandir and the handy-in-hell long sword Frost Brand, can only be found by expending a wish, or a once-in-a-blue-moon random drop. On other hand, Excalibur can be obtained as early as level 5 by knights and lawful valkyries and will carry you though to the endgame. It is, however, a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Artifact</a>, in that its damage is less than impressive in late-game, and wielding it draws monsters to you like moths to a flame.
</li><li> The Serpentine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunlessSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunlessSea">Sunless Sea</a></em> is a unique engine that provides decent speed, some good stat boosts and has a very good fuel mileage for its engine power. It's not quite as fast the most expensive engine you can purchase and doesn't hold a candle to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">The Fulgent Impeller</a>, but obtaining The Serpentine doesn't require you to finish a sidequest that spans as long as an Ambition. Unfortunately, <em>unlike</em> The Fulgent Impeller obtaining The Serpentine is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> that can only be done once per captain.
</li><li> The Agravain-class Juggernaut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunlessSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunlessSkies">Sunless Skies</a></em> can be obtained the moment you hit Albion (the game's second location) and is a very good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a> locomotive that will carry a player through the mid-to late game. It's not <em>as</em> good a combat vessel as the Medea, as good an explorer as the Moloch or as good a trading vessel as the Altani, but it does all three roles decently without requiring twice the price-tag or to dive into the game's hardest region early on.

It's possible to play multiple games without ever seeing one. The Large Frigate has inferior stats, but is still powerful in its own right, and one can easily be gained just by finding and taking down Henry Morgan.

The Lava Katana, on the other hand, can be obtained from Marlon's shop after reaching the bottom of the mine. While it doesn't have the raw Attack power of a Galaxy weapon, it does offer helpful boosts to Defense and Critical Hit Rate that the others lack, making it useful against the tougher enemies in the Skull Cavern.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series has the Typhoon Missile. It is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveAmmo">eight-warhead tracking missile</a> that deals 240 megajoules of damage total, with each warhead dealing 30 megajoules to stack up the damage. To put things in perspective, there are no ships below the class of corvettes that can mount shields at 200MJ or higher, with the only exceptions being the Argon Eclipse and some models of the Teladi Falcon, especially the Sentinel version (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">it is the only non-capital ship in the games that can fit 400MJ of shielding, or two 200MJ shields</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">This means that fighters are going to get easily vaporized by the incoming swarms of these mildly overpowered missiles</a>.

While the Typhoon is restricted in its usability to be only carried by capital ships, capships themselves that aren't of Kha'ak and Terran/ATF design make really good use of the missile by inflicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a> against enemy fighters, especially if it comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">Teladi capship</a>.

Not only is the missile an economical weapon in most combat situations, its factories can be purchased at any available shipyard that is not in Terran territory.

The Heavy Gauss does 15 more damage than the Gauss Rifle, but is less accurate and sacrifices auto-fire while greatly increasing weight. Compounding those problems is the fact that, despite the damage increase, the Heavy Gauss is still less powerful than the Sonic Blasta-Rifle. The Sonic Cannon, on the other hand, is the second most powerful weapon in the game, with 130 points of damage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note096om');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note096om" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note096om');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the most powerful weapon, the Disruptor Pulse Launcher, does 200 damage, but is explosive rather than a single shot</span> and a bit more accurate than the Sonic Blasta-Rifle. However, it takes 50% of a unit's time units to fire a snap shot, and 80% to fire an aimed shot, meaning you'll get at most two shots from it, and only if you do literally nothing else. The Sonic Blasta-Rifle is less powerful and slightly less accurate, but because it lacks significant drawbacks, is the best weapon for 90% of the game.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">first game</a> has the humble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Laser Rifle</a>.

As an added bonus, it's a required stop upon the research tree to Laser Cannons, which are the Infinity Minus One Sword for your ships (and pocketbook).

The best fighter that needs no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">elerium</a>. Enough speed to catch all UFO types, but two. Enough hit points, agility and firepower to fight biggest UFOs &mdash; battleships &mdash; one-on-one and survive (more often than not). And best of all, you can get it before your enemies start getting serious. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11wkdc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11wkdc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11wkdc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The game starts in December 1996, UFOs start attacking in January 1999, the technologies can be researched as early as spring of 1997, although mid-1998 is more sane.</span> Still, it cannot help against infiltrations or enemies that don't use flying craft.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlasmaCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlasmaCannon">plasma weapons</a> represented the undisputed apex of XCOM's weapons technology, but then the <em>War of the Chosen</em> expansion came along and with it the three eponymous Chosen, dangerous bosses that wield unique and extremely powerful weapons. These weapons can be taken from them upon their final defeat, and they remain just as unique and powerful in the hands of your operatives, thus relegating plasma weaponry to ISMO status instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>'s relic units - most prominently found in the <em>Dark Crusade</em> and <em>Soulstorm</em> expansions - are immensely powerful units at the very top of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree">Tech Tree</a> that can only be built under specific conditions, and you can only ever have one at a time. Some like the Baneblade superheavy tank have almost as much firepower as the rest of your army combined, with the durability to match, while others rely on special abilities over raw damage output instead. However, unless you're playing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">Easy</a> or your opponent is exceptionally inept, no relic unit is powerful enough to win a battle on its own. They <em>will</em> turn the tide of battle if your enemy doesn't have a relic themselves and you send in yours to support the rest of your troops, but without this support they will die quickly in the crossfire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> A general rule of thumb is that most B or A rank weapons will be this.
</li><li> Most of the time, the Silver weapons for their high attack power and the Killer weapons for their critical rate are the preferred choices to bring through the whole game for boss killing purposes. They are usable by almost every character in the game as long as they have the sufficient weapon ranks to use them, and can be purchased in some mid-late game stages. In a series where your Infinity Plus Ones are generally tailor made to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, these weapons are really useful. The Javelin and Hand Axe also tend to see use for a very long time, as they allow melee characters to fight and counter at range (and as your character grows faster than the enemies, they actually tend to get <em>more</em> effective as the game goes on).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Fire Emblem Gaiden</a></em> and its remake <em>Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</em>:
<ul><li> The Royal Sword. It's exclusive to Alm, but it's the most powerful sword he's going to get on his route, it has a 20% boost to crit rate that is only matched by a few weapons, and it even gives Alm a little HP recovery. It's even stronger in <em>Shadows of Valentia</em>; it gives Alm access to the Double Lion skill, which turns the Royal Sword into a brave weapon (an ability only shared with the Killer Bow, the hard-to-get Ladyblade, and the DLC Trainee's Lance and Wayward Lance), and the Scendscale skill, which gives him three range and is only shared with the Falchion. The Royal Sword will carry Alm clear through to the final battle with Duma, and can even see use in <em>Shadows of Valentia</em>'s post-game due to Double Lion.
</li><li> In practice, the Beloved Zofia also acts like this. It serves as Celica's personal weapon and can first be forged at about the same time Alm gets the Royal Sword (midway through Act 3), with approximately the same stats. It serves as a fine weapon for Celica, and is the best for her to use unless you can find a spare Ladyblade or two.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>, we have:
<ul><li> Sigurd's Silver Sword. He gets it at the end of the <em>prologue</em>, turning a character who was already the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a> into a godlike unit that can smash almost anything that faces him. Since you can repair weapons for a relatively low fee in this game, he can tear up the rest of the 1st generation chapters with it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButWaitTheresMore">But Wait, There's More!</a> The sword picks up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical skill</a> after racking up 50 kills, which becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingWeapon">increasingly potent</a> for the next 50 kills after that. On a character who has mounts, and is needed to seize a castle, Sigurd is more than expected to be exposed to a lot of combat. This sword can then be passed down to his son Seliph in the 2nd generation. Bottom line: that Silver Sword may not be one of the Holy Weapons, but for practical purposes it's damn close.
</li><li> Finn's Brave Lance. He gets it near the beginning of Chapter 2 and instantly starts kicking ass with it. Although Finn leaves at the end of Chapter 3, the Brave Lance can be sold and bought by Ferry, who doesn't leave. She can also pass it down to her daughter Fee, and, like the Silver Sword, it's easy to rack up the necessary 50 kills to grant it the Critical skill. And if you leave it with Finn, he will still have it when he returns in Chapter 7.
</li><li> Lex's Brave Axe. Though obtaining it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moment, it's found right near the end of Chapter 1. This turns Lex from a mounted wall to a mounted dealer of death. The Axe is effectively exclusive to Lex, as only two other first generation units can use axes, and neither can do so before promotion. Even better, if it was obtained in the first generation, it can be recovered from a boss early in the second and given to one of Lex's nephews.
</li><li> Ayra's Brave Sword. She can get it right in the beginning of Chapter 3. Combined with her Astra skill, Ayra becomes one of the most powerful characters in the game. The sword isn't exclusive to her and Sigurd can make great use of it, too. The sword can also be passed down, most notably to Seliph through Sigurd, or to Ayra's daughter Larcei, who both join right in the beginning of the second generation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> we have a few more:
<ul><li> Osian's signature axe, Vouge. Picture a throwing axe with high attack power, as much crit as a killer weapon, REALLY accurate, a whopping 60 uses, used by a unit that already gets an insane number of critical hits by himself, including an ability that ensures guaranteed critical during counterattacks. You get this amazing axe in chapter 1, for a unit that you get a large portion of the game to train and make uber who started off with amazing stats even by <em>Thracia</em>'s standards. If the game in general weren't so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">notoriously difficult</a>, it'd be a bonafide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> The Brave weapons has the ability to perform 2 attacks at once, and have good hit rates alongside relatively low weapon ranks. They are weaker than the Master weapons (which have the same ability to perform 2 attacks at once, including a bonus of 1-2 range attack except for the Master Sword), except lighter, more accurate, much more limited in quantity in exchange of triple amount of the usage, much easier to get, and better availability.
</li><li> The Brave Lance is the signature weapon of Finn, who returns from <em>Genealogy</em>, a powerful character who joins in Chapter 1 and is only absent during the Manster Prison Break. It is by far the best out of the three since it gives an additional +10 Luck which works well with his Prayer ability. The only downside for this weapon is the fact that it is unusable indoors, and most of the late game chapters are indoor chapters. That being said, you have no reason not to use it throughout the earlier chapters to help you in capturing and killing some of the tougher opponents in the game.
</li><li> The Brave Axe is a D Rank Axe, which means it is usable by almost every character who can use Axes. You get it in Chapter 1, by visiting a specific village with Havan. Havan is basically Osian, with the ability to attack first during enemy phase, better chance to critical hit outside the enemy phase, and SLIGHTLY worse stats.
</li><li> The Brave Sword is acquired during chapter 4x and is a rank C sword. This weapon is helpful during the Manster Prison Break, and, with the right character, is a deadly weapon that can be a massive help for capturing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade</a></em>, you can get a few of the legendary weapons much earlier, unlike in <em>The Blazing Blade</em>. Most notable is Durandal, which is obtained in Chapter 8x and can be wielded by anyone with an S rank in swords. Be careful though, as it only has 20 uses, and it cannot run out of uses if you want to access the true ending.
</li><li> Most players of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade</a></em> will let Eliwood and Lyn continue using their early-game unique weapons (Rapier and Mani Katti, respectively) even after they each get legendary weapons (Durandal and Sol Katti) to replace them. This is because neither of them have the constitution to use their legendary weapon without massive speed penalties, so unless you absolutely need the legendary weapons' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> anti-dragon</span> properties, it's often better to use their normal weapons so they can still double-attack (or at least, avoid <em>being</em> double-attacked by the enemy). Hector doesn't have the same problem (Armads fits his constitution perfectly), but his Wolf Beil's combined anti-armor and anti-cavalry properties are still incredibly useful no matter where you are in the game. Even then, the Rapier and Mani Kati have the same anti-armor and anti-cavalry abilities as the Wolf Beil, as well as decent critical hit rates for non-Killer weapons, so they're still very useful at any point in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>, you can buy a Beast Killer knife for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Sothe</a> as early as chapter 1-4. While this immediately comes in handy on that same chapter (which is filled with beast laguz, and the Beast Killer does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>), you'll quickly find that the beast-killing is just a bonus. It has a Might of 9, which is a lot for a knife weapon (only three of them have a Might over 10), and a Crit of 20 (only the rare Killer weapons offer more than that, and as there is no Killer knife, well...). Its only weakness is its low Hit%, which doesn't matter for Sothe who is virtually guaranteed to hit everything anyway. Considering that you don't get the second-best knife until the endgame, and don't get the best unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">you know what you're doing</a> (and on a chapter very close to Endgame anyway), odds are that the Beast Killer will be Sothe's best weapon for a long, long time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Falchion isn't exactly the most powerful of swords, but it's still an adequate weapon on the field for Chrom; it's available from the start of the game, it does extra damage against dragon enemies, and most importantly, it <em>never breaks</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucina's</span> Parallel Falchion fits the trope even better, as it has a Might of 12 (one point greater than the Silver Sword), a Hit Rate of 80%, and a 5% crit boost plus the same dragon-smiting abilities and unbreakable nature as the Falchion and the ability to use it like an item for an effective 20 HP recovery. The only requirement to get it is to complete Chapter 13 to gain access to the character who has it.
</li><li> Frederick's starting Silver Lance also counts (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">especially on higher difficulties where he is effectively the only thing standing between you and total annihilation</a>), as you don't get access to more Silver weaponry until at least halfway through the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingWeapon">first upgrade</a> for the Yato in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>. It's acquired roughly at the halfway point of each route, and gives the Yato a slight power boost as well as granting small stat bonuses as long as Corrin has it in their inventory. There's another upgrade for it, but it can only be gotten in the very final chapter of each route. As long as Corrin stays in a sword-wielding class, the Noble/Grim/Alpha Yato will likely be their go-to weapon for a good chunk of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> has the base form of the Sword of the Creator, which will serve you very well until it automatically upgrades into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Sublime Creator Sword</a> midway through Chapter 10.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Person Shooters&nbsp;</div><div id="folder14" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em>, the three best weapons are the assault rifles - the Kalashnikov, MP5, and M4 Carbine. However, the handgun Desert Eagle is arguably superior with decent power, a decent rate of fire when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">Dual Wielded</a> (an ability exclusive to the second game), and it has great accuracy. With proper use of bullet time and good aim, the player can headshot most Mooks with it and kill them with one hit. As well, the Desert Eagle, like most shotguns and handguns, is quite common in the first 66% of the game or so while the three assault rifle weapons are rare. Not to mention they <em>are</em> assault rifles, and thus you use up a lot of ammo fast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersFallOfCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersFallOfCybertron">Transformers: Fall of Cybertron</a></em> has around twenty weapons available of varying degrees of power and availability. Until you find then unlock better weapons and gear (at which point you may use them in the earlier portions of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>), your arsenal is severely limited and you won't have access to the really destructive tech. However, you <em>will</em> have access to the Path Blaster from the start of the game&mdash;Optimus even begins with one. While it's not as capable of mass destruction as the Glass Gas Gun or the Riot Cannon, it's a fast, fairly powerful, reasonably accurate, decently supplied medium-range magnum-like weapon that will drop any standard Decepticon trooper in two shots (or just one if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">blow their heads off instead</a>). You can also purchase an upgrade that randomly inserts a high-powered explosive charge somewhere in your current magazine, which causes a gigantic explosion if it hits anything. The Path Blaster can handle pretty much any situation the game might throw at you up until you acquire and upgrade the Riot Cannon, which happens far later in the game.

Most players therefore settle for more easily available planes like the F-22 or Su-37.
<ul><li> One can even go farther back than that, unlike <em>Air Force Delta</em> stats tend not to count so much in <em>Ace Combat</em>, indeed you really only want to focus on Mobility and Attack (use less mini-missiles) unless the level specifically calls for a lot of hopping back and forth between locations. It is actually easier to take out enemies with a slower but far more maneuverable plane in the pure dogfight levels. You basically make yourself into a floating turret and blast everyone that overshoots. Any plane before the superplanes but after the Tiger II/Crusader/A5 can generally be this. All about playstyle. You might even be able to consider the F2/MIG31 the infinity minus one sword if you are crazygood with rockets.
</li></ul></li><li> For many players of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em> series (and by extension the native <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> tabletop wargame), the top tier of weapons consists of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun">Clan ER-PPC</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">Gauss rifle</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Autocannon-20</a>. All of these weapons are massively powerful, but come with major drawbacks such as high heat generation, immense weight, vulnerable components (particularly their ammo stowage), rarity limiting availability, and especially cost. Players who still want some punch without having to make such sacrifices tend to pick equipment out of the second tier of weapons, which consist of things like standard PPCs, large lasers, and Autocannon-10 variants. These weapons lack the apocalyptic firepower of their top tier counterparts, but they weigh less, don't heat up as much, carry more ammo, and are generally cheaper and more readily available. Most importantly, the majority of these second-tier weapons meet or exceed the all-important 10-point damage threshold, which is exactly the amount of damage needed to remove all the armor from a 'Mech's head in a single hit, as well as possibly kill the pilot.
