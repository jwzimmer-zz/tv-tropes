<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts">ACME Productions</a> have been working for the past year on their hit television show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Alice and Bob</a></em>. The past several seasons have been a total hit with audiences, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfMemes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfMemes">just about every memorable quote has become a meme</a>, and everyone is just counting down the days until release. Everything is going very well, and ACME are about to hit the metaphorical button to launch their newest season!
</p><p>But then all of a sudden, it somehow wound up on the internet. Somehow, someway, all of the new season's episodes and content have suddenly become downloadable due to being purloined and posted on piracy websites. In a few short hours, all of the careful preparation and marketing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">is now common knowledge</a>.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> In 2010, episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Heroman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Heroman">Heroman</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippuden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoShippuden">Naruto Shippuden</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OccultAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OccultAcademy">Occult Academy</a></em> were leaked on YouTube before their broadcast by a fake official account with the username of "TVTokyoatYT". It is believed to have been an internal leak, considering there were no subtitles or watermarks on the leaked videos, and in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Heroman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Heroman">Heroman</a></em>, the leaked episodes were <em>months</em> ahead of the Japanese broadcast.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Creator:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> has had multiple incidents involving content being leaked from their servers, in part due to poor security (at least one episode was leaked simply by changing the episode URL, where the next episode was already publicly accessible but unlisted).
<ul><li> Episode 9 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistBrotherhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemistBrotherhood">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em> was leaked from Funimation's servers the day before the English subtitled version was set to be simulcast. However, the episode had already aired in Japan.
</li><li> Episode 403 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, the first episode that was going to be simulcast by Funimation, was leaked a day before the episode aired in Japan, with both a Funimation watermark and English hard subs confirming it was sourced from their servers.
</li><li> Episode 10 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhantomOfInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhantomOfInferno">Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~</a></em> was leaked from Funimation's servers the day before it was broadcast in Japan, again with both a watermark and English hard subs.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to Funimation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadmanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadmanEntertainment">Madman Entertainment</a> has had some problems with content being leaked from their server.
<ul><li> Episode 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Coppelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Coppelion">Coppelion</a></em> was leaked hours before it was broadcast in Japan.
</li><li> Several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> were leaked from Madman's servers hours before they were broadcast in Japan, which led to their simulcast being pulled.
</li><li> The Japanese version of the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em> was leaked from Madman's servers the day before the English version was broadcast in America and <em>two days</em> before the Japanese broadcast.
</li></ul></li><li> Several manga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em>, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Major" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Major">Major</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, and <em>One Piece</em>, have been leaked before their release dates in the magazine on file-sharing services and YouTube slideshows. Some arrests have been made because of these leaks, the most recent of which was in 2010 of a 14-year-old student.
</li><li> A document from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioBONES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioBONES">Studio BONES</a> was leaked online in 2008 which referenced the then-unannounced <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> season 2 and "Fullmetal 2" (<em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>). The president of Bones claimed this document was fictional and that the anime listed on it had not "been decided yet" (though both did eventually occur).
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Work:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The last six minutes of episode 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> season 2 were accidentally leaked onto YouTube five days before being broadcast in Japan by Bandai Channel, who were actually testing a system meant to block copyrighted videos of the anime from being posted when the leak occurred.
</li><li> Episode 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em> was leaked from Anime News Network's servers a day before it was broadcast in Japan, which led to the simulcast being temporarily halted.
</li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em> was leaked from the French website KZPlay, who had the simulcast rights to the series and accidentally released it two days early.
</li><li> Due to miscommunication between the American and Japanese sides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimeNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimeNetwork">Anime Network</a> accidentally premiered the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru Darkness</a></em> a day before it was broadcast in Japan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em>:
<ul><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em> was announced for license in France, an image of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiraKiraPrecureALaMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiraKiraPrecureALaMode">Kirakira&#9733;PreCure a la Mode</a></em> was used instead. Come June, and it's revealed that <em>A La Mode</em> was supposed to be released after <em>Futari Wa</em>.
</li><li> The profile section of the website for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HealinGoodPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HealinGoodPrettyCure">Healin' Good&#9825;Pretty Cure</a></em> was accidentally put up a few hours earlier than the rest of the site. It was only accessible by a hidden link (as the website had the "teaser image" put up instead of the final homepage) that quickly spread across the Internet, to the point where Google had it as a top link when you searched the show's name in Japanese.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian Animation&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Due to briefly being unlisted and hidden, some episodes of the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/PleasantGoatAndBigBigWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/PleasantGoatAndBigBigWolf">Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf</a>: Mighty Little Defenders</em> uploaded by the series' official English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel were found by fans a few days before their intended release date. Once these episodes were privated until they were intended to come out, fans made copies of them early.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film &#151; Animation&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frozen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frozen">Frozen</a></em>:
<ul><li> Prior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">first film's</a> release, a lot of early production concept art and story points were leaked. These included the long haired, "Snow Queen"-looking Elsa in a hat and plot details from when Elsa was still the villain.
</li><li> Promotional images of Anna and Elsa's near-finalized designs were accidentally leaked in early 2013, weeks before they were meant to be revealed. As these were <em>leaks</em>, they weren't even the official models. The images used older, less polished (alternatively, "more ugly") models, more specifically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamworksFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamworksFace">Dreamworks Face</a> image was used for Elsa. This caused some fan backlash until their smoother looking official designs were revealed a bit afterwards.
</li><li> In mid-January 2020, exactly a month and a half after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FrozenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FrozenII">the film's sequel</a> was released in theaters and a week before the sing-along release of that film, two different high-quality rips of the film were illegally leaked onto the Internet: one with English subtitles burned into the file and the other without them.
</li></ul></li><li> A high-quality rip of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfOzDorothysReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfOzDorothysReturn">Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return</a></em> sourced from United Airlines' in-flight entertainment library was illegally leaked online a month before its' Blu-Ray release.
</li><li> An unfinished rough cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasAndTheMagicRailroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasAndTheMagicRailroad">Thomas and the Magic Railroad</a></em>, along with many screenshots that were given to a few fans by one of the film's producers, was leaked online in May 2020, a month before the film's supposed original 20th Anniversary Blu-ray release from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShoutFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShoutFactory">Shout! Factory</a>. Uploads of the leak were quickly reported and taken down due to severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> and anger from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas &amp; Friends</a> fandom, especially from those yearning for the official release of the film's director's cut. Thankfully, it didn't affect the Blu-Ray release, as the deleted scenes will still be legally included as a bonus feature when it comes out on September 29, 2020.
</li><li> An interesting case happens with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBearsTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBearsTheMovie">We Bare Bears: The Movie</a></em>. The movie was meant to come out on digital on June 8, 2020, but was then moved to June 30 at the last minute. However, sites like Amazon and Fandango were not informed of this, and the movie went up during the overnight hours of the original date; it was reverted to pre-order status during business hours that day (movie purchases made during that period are still availble).

<h3><strong>By Studio:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The 2014 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures">Sony Pictures</a> leak saw the compromise of several unreleased films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annie2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annie2014">Annie (2014)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StillAlice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StillAlice">Still Alice</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrTurner">Mr Turner</a></em>, and <em>To Write Love On Her Arms</em>, a leaked script from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>, and several documents detailing behind the scenes incidents during the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></em>.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Work:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> A screener for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGangster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGangster">American Gangster</a></em> had a leaked a couple of weeks before the film was released.
</li><li> A famous example was the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie">American Pie</a></em>, which had a workprint (bearing the original title of the film, "Great Falls High") released in-between its theatrical run and DVD release. The workprint leak eventually led the Weitz Brothers to release both a rated-R and "unrated" version of the film, which utilized some of the material found in the workprint.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dolittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dolittle">Dolittle</a></em> was illegally leaked online two weeks after its theatrical release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables3">The Expendables 3</a></em> got leaked almost a month before it was released.
</li><li> Screeners for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHatefulEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHatefulEight">The Hateful Eight</a></em> were leaked online some days before it began its theatrical run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHurtLocker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHurtLocker">The Hurt Locker</a></em> was leaked 5 months before it released in the United States.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEliteSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEliteSquad">The Elite Squad</a></em> leaked two months before release, and became a piracy hit. It still got great box office upon its official release, nevertheless.

<ul><li> The first trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> was scheduled to release during an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, but it leaked online nearly a week early. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelStudios">Marvel Studios</a>' response was to tweet "Dammit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hydra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hydra">Hydra</a>."
</li><li> Marvel and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolland">Tom Holland</a> later staged some announcements as Holland "accidentally" leaking information, as jokes on how he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotKeepASecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotKeepASecret">Cannot Keep a Secret</a>. First he revealed the teaser poster for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em> (and only afterward saw the note that it was confidential). Then he gave a status update saying they were about to begin the second <em>Spider-Man</em> film, but he didn't have anything to share because he only just got the script &mdash; which was clearly labeled with the title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em>.
</li><li> On April 15, 2019, five minutes of footage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, including clips taken from the second and third acts of the film, were leaked online with Arabian subtitles, a full ten days before the film was officially released. The Russo brothers issued a letter telling fans again not to spoil the film to others and used the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame.
</li></ul></li><li> A version of the script of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em> got leaked a few months before its release. It's unclear if it was the shooting script or a draft but it was verified as accurate when the movie came out (albeit with some tweaks).
</li><li> Screeners for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRevenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRevenant">The Revenant</a></em> were also leaked online some days before it began its theatrical run.

John Boyega's shooting script was also stolen and placed on eBay, but in this case it was recovered before any damage could be done.
<ul><li> This didn't start with the final film in the Sequel Trilogy. Months before the official release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a>, the vast majority of the film's plot was online.

With a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">unfinished visual effects shots</a> included in this version, viewers have argued that this version is actually better than the theatrical release, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">albeit for the wrong reasons</a>.
</li><li> Cinefex Issue #170, which was written and prepared before theaters shut down globally and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNewMutants">The New Mutants</a></em> was delayed for the fourth time, featured high-quality scans of certain scenes from the movie, such as a shot from Magik's confrontation with the Demon Bear, and multiple plot spoilers. The issue was originally planned to release after the movie did, but due to the magazine's publication schedule, it came out on the date it was already scheduled for with no adjustments to the content that was included.
</li><li> Screeners for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDarkThirty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDarkThirty">Zero Dark Thirty</a></em> got leaked about 2 weeks before this film was released.

She felt so betrayed over the whole thing that she scrapped the whole project and posted the leaked chapters on her own website. However, years later she finished the novel, and it was published in 2020.
</li><li> When teasing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorDogs">Survivor Dogs</a></em>, HarperCollins' plan was to keep secret what animal the new series would be based on, so that it would be a big hyped-up reveal. Fans discovered on HC's own online catalog a poorly-labeled image of a cardboard stand for bookstores, with the first book's art and the text "the time has come for dogs to rule the wild" across the top. They removed the image after fans began to spread it around.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>, as HarperCollins doesn't set strict embargo dates on the books, some stores sell them before the release date, and spoiler threads prior to release used to be a regular thing on official and fan forums. According to one of the official forum's mods, it was legal and they'd allow such posts; it was just that if HarperCollins figured out which stores did it regularly they might delay shipments to that store until after the release date.

Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> asking for people to not reveal anything, one newspaper revealed spoilers from the episode, including the reveal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt">John Hurt</a> as a new Doctor.

</li><li> The Season 8 premiere episode, along with several scripts for the season, leaked online due to a breach at the BBC's Latin-American affiliate station in Miami, FL. Interestingly, the leaked episode (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath">"Deep Breath"</a>) was a workprint copy that was in black-and-white, still retained previous Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a>'s credits sequence (instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>'s) and had unfinished effects. The BBC later claimed that the breach (which also included uncontextualized scenes from workprint episodes for the first half of the season) was caused by someone mistakenly leaving the materials on a publicly-accessible part of the Miami server.
</li><li> A clip featuring the Thirteenth Doctor from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E1TheWomanWhoFellToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E1TheWomanWhoFellToEarth">"The Woman Who Fell to Earth"</a> leaked onto the Internet in July 2018, prior to the episode's broadcast in October 2018.
</li><li> On November 21, 2018, Amazon Prime subscribers in the US who tried to watch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E7Kerblam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E7Kerblam">"Kerblam!"</a>, the then-most-recent episode, were instead treated to the <em>next</em> episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E8TheWitchfinders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS37E8TheWitchfinders">"The Witchfinders"</a>, which was set to air that coming weekend.

</li><li> An early cut of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em> pilot leaked online three months before the episode was due to air. The leaked version is nearly identical to the final version with mostly minor differences to the editing and special effects (such as a darker version of the opening credits). The only major alteration to the aired episode is an additional scene of Peter Bishop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">"questioning"</a> a suspect.

<ul><li> Four screener copies of episodes from the fifth season were leaked online weeks before their official airing. Notably, this trope was brought up when Alexander Siddig (who played Prince Doran) <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1559239/a-game-of-thrones-actor-just-accused-hbo-of-leaking-its-own-episodes">accused HBO of intentionally leaking the episodes in order to hype up fan demand<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The Season 6 premiere was accidentally leaked by HBO's Nordic division one day earlier than expected, and snatched up by enterprising fans just before the company pulled it off their streaming service.
</li><li> The main plot points of season 7 were leaked on Reddit in 2016.
</li><li> The network's India branch had an internal break-in midway through the seventh season, with a staff member leaking nearly all remaining episodes of the season (save for the finale), as well as scripts and other information, for everyone to view well before their intended airdate. This led to several spoiler-spreading troll campaigns on social media sites and caused HBO to film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoilerFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoilerFootage">fake ending scenes</a> for Season 8 so that no one could spoil it.
</li><li> Season 8 has mostly been kept totally under wraps, but Germany's HBO branch accidentally uploaded the second episode to their Amazon service early. The error was corrected quickly enough, but not so quickly as to prevent trolls from watching it and spreading spoilers.
</li><li> While actual episodes remained under wraps, detailed spoilers about the final three Season 8 episodes did leak in the weeks before they were due to air. Many fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">dismissed</a> them, believing the twists involved were too outrageous to happen, only for every single one to come true over the ensuing airings.

When a new season of either show starts, the catalogue is usually the first thing that has <em>any</em> information about it (beyond the title, which gets leaked through trademark filings), and the next quarter's catalogue featuring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> usually drops just before the season even begins.
<ul><li> One case of a <em>Kamen Rider</em> series leaked by other means than toy catalogues is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZiO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderZiO">Kamen Rider Zi-O</a></em>, which was first revealed when a bug in <em>Kamen Rider Buttabosoul</em> arcade machines led them to start showing his advertisements early. Amusingly, the key concept of <em>Zi-O</em> is timelines and the bug was that the system clock wasn't set right.
</li></ul></li><li> A rough draft for the first episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> live-action series was posted on Scriptshadow in March 2020 and was leaked all over social media. It was eventually taken down two months later.
</li><li> The first ten(!) episodes of the fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3193409/hackers-leak-10-new-orange-is-the-new-black-episodes-after-netflix-failed-to-pay-ransom.html">were leaked by hackers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as part of an extortion attempt against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>. The leak reportedly stemmed from a production vendor whose security was compromised.
</li><li> The last three episodes of the Starz series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Power" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Power">Power</a></em>'s fourth season leaked online via a bizarre video that showed a man streaming the episodes from his phone, along with commentary throughout and an explanation of how he was able to access the episodes (the streamer had used a friend's media credentials to access the Starz press portal and see the episodes before their release).
</li><li> Several rough cut episodes in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em> were leaked online weeks before their intended premiere dates.

</li><li> The pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">Supergirl (2015)</a></em> was leaked onto the internet in May 2015, the same time CBS picked it up.
</li><li> The original pilot episode for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em> leaked months before its original airing. Notably, this episode was greatly changed after the fact in response to a then-recent school shooting, along with the recasting of Sarah's fiancee to a different actor.
</li><li> A famous case that influenced the direction of an entire season was during the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>. Several scripts leaked to a site called "Ryan's Report" detailing the direction of then-upcoming episodes, including a spoiler that government agency CTU was going to fake the death of its acting director, Ryan Chappelle. Once word of this leaked, production changed their minds and had lead character Jack Bauer execute Chappelle in a late-season episode as a response. The set of the show also faced numerous content leaks in the following five seasons, with scripts and set photos being leaked by enterprising fans (even interior sets weren't exempt from this).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>:
<ul><li> Scripts for the first three episodes of the third season leaked weeks before the season officially premiered.
</li><li> Averted by the producers, who filmed fake death scenes for the Season 7 premiere (when Negan picks a victim to beat to death with Lucille) and even paid actors who were killed off to show up on set for several months as a way to throw off fans who were staking out the set and taking photos. A "foiler" clip of Negan beating Maggie to death while Glenn screams in anguish was one of these fakes, and leaked online several days before the episode aired (the actual victims were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abraham and Glenn</span>).

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FionaApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FionaApple">Fiona Apple</a>: "Extraordinary Machine" had been recorded in 2003 but was shelved by her label. Some songs from it were leaked over the following 2 years with CD quality versions of all of the tracks being online by early 2005. It wouldn't be officially released until October 2005 though much of the album was rerecorded by then.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Bj&ouml;rk</a>'s album <em>Vulnicura</em> was leaked 2 months before its original release date. This caused the album to get released earlier than what was initially planned.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX">Charli XCX</a> got hit with this <em>hard</em> in the leadup to her intended third studio album, initially teased in 2015, with its debut single "After the Afterparty" releasing in 2016. However, before an official release date was decided, Charli's Google Drive account was hacked in 2017, spilling out hundreds of demos, release-ready recordings, and other promotional material over the course of the year onto the internet. In a combination with this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">label politics</a>, this version of the album (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a>'d <em>XCX World</em>) was sent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, and Charli decided to reboot the entire project by 2018, releasing another album in its place in 2019 titled <em>Charli</em>. Charli has since gone on record that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">the experience greatly disillusioned her view on the leaked material and that she has no interest in releasing XCX World or other leaked material legitimately anymore</a>, ironically meaning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">the leaks are the only way to listen to them now</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake">Drake</a>: All of the songs from his debut studio album "Thank Me Later" got leaked within 2 weeks before it was officially released.

It was rumoured at the time that this was why the notoriously irascible Mark E Smith had decided to have the whole album remixed and retitled <em>The Real New Fall LP</em>, but he later said that it was just because he was unhappy with the album's initial mix.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LupeFiasco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LupeFiasco">Lupe Fiasco</a>: His debut "Food and Liquor" was leaked before it was released. In between the leak and the official release, Lupe had recorded additional songs for the album.

SiIvaGunner and TurretBot have both referenced this incident by uploading remixes of faucet sounds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>: The first single from the Artpop album "Applause" was released earlier than planned as it had already been leaked multiple times.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a>: Subverted. She anticipated people would try to leak "American Life" before it was released and she flooded the internet with fake mp3 files that claimed to be leak versions of the album but were actually just recordings of her saying "What the fuck do you think you're doing?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> sued Napster after a demo of their song "I Disappear" (their contribution to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionImpossibleII">Mission: Impossible II</a></em> soundtrack) got leaked online and to radio before the official version of the single was commercially available.

In response, the album was made available on its official site before the official release. It's rumored that the source of the leak was none other than Trent Reznor himself, as a response to the RIAA sending cease &amp; desist letters to various fansites that hosted tracks that were deliberately leaked as part of the tie-in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame">Alternate Reality Game</a>.
</li><li> An early version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a>'s Comic Relief charity single <em>One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)</em> was leaked before the official release.

The recording of a recording was of such poor quality that the band released the demo as a free track, in much better resolution.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>:
<ul><li> <em>Kid A</em> was leaked 3 weeks before its original release and available through Napster. This however did not stop the album from reaching number 1 in the United States, UK and some other countries despite the lack of general promotion for the album.
</li><li> It happened again with <em>Hail to the thief</em> where demo versions of the tracks got leaked 10 weeks before the finished version was commercially available.

Interestingly, rather than push the release date up, West used the time to revise the album which led to some tracks being remixed and others being outright removed.
</li><li> After receiving a copy of the album, the Chicago radio station Q101 aired the entirety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes">The White Stripes</a> album <em>Icky Thump</em> before the album was commercially available.

<ul><li> The pinball podcast host and known leaker Kaneda repeatedly hinted at its existence in the latter half of 2019 before revealing increasingly detailed information. He started with some textual details about the game, along with the schedule for their actual reveal (a teaser video would be posted on December 22nd before the game's full reveal the next day). This was followed by him prematurely posting the game's promo video.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0a5b2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0a5b2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0a5b2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Notably, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTl85w0uYE0">the leaked video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> features a few noticeable differences from <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/F2XZFrC0Lq0?t=13">the official version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> - there are several voice clips from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">the original series</a> that are absent from the final cut, and the end screen is laid out differently.</span>
</li><li> Shortly before the video was posted, two different sources (a Pinside user and the website This Week in Pinball) posted much longer, more detailed, and very similar lists of the game's features near-simultaneously. Most all of their claims were proven correct when the game was properly announced.

Luckily Games Workshop is known to take the matter very lightly and usually answers to the leaks by giving high quality pictures of the leaked stuff, usually by making a video featuring lighthearted jabs to the leakers.

Monolith Productions later mandated that if employees were going to a computer repair shop, another of the staff had to go with them to prevent leaks.

</li><li> Early April 2020, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Crytek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Crytek">Crytek</a> was teasing an announcement for an upcoming game, but on April 16, a website for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a> Remastered</em> was discovered before it went public. This was coupled with one of Intel's Twitter accounts posting a teaser trailer for the game, and then quickly pulling it. It was made official later in the day.
</li><li> The first DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> was accidentally released a couple days early on Xbox One.

</li><li> A series of updates to the game's API accidentally leaked several armor sets from <em>Forsaken</em> in summer 2018, including the Reverie Dawn armor, whose lore spoils the existence of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Riven, the last and Taken Ahamkara.</span>
</li><li> Update 2.0 ended up leading to the discovery of all lore entries in <em>Forsaken</em>. This includes Truth to Power, which cannot be legitimately collected until a grand total of <em>30 weeks</em> after a player finds the first entry, assuming they stop to collect it at every possible opportunity.
</li><li> Similarly, Update 2.1 leaked entries for <em>Black Armory</em> and The Dawning. Moreover, it also ended up leaking a cutscene spoiling a major plot twist which would not be available in-game for several weeks after its discovery.
</li><li> Outside of datamining, the exact rewards for the <em>Black Armory</em>, <em>Joker's Wild</em>, and <em>Penumbra</em> preludes, all of which are exotic quests, were leaked before their official reveals by an anonymous source.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">The Elder Scrolls Online</a></em> had a closed beta with a strict NDA for over half a year prior to release. Someone recorded footage of one of the earlier betas with the game set to its lowest graphics settings, which put many off the game early on as it was a bad first impression. This resulted in all later betas having your username splashed everywhere in semi-transparent text across the screen so that they could catch future leakers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverybodyEdits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverybodyEdits">Everybody Edits</a></em>, leaks usually come in two forms: unfinished content left in the game intended for a future update, and text found in private update worlds through hacking.
<ul><li> Former game owner NVD accidentally leaked the names of the Gingerbread, Caroler, Elf, and Nutcracker smileys in a screenshot before they were released December 2014.
</li><li> The 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> update had some data left in that revealed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fairytale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fairytale">Fairytale</a> Pack plus three new smileys: Sick, Unsure, and Goofy. All of this properly added to the game less than two hours after this was discovered.
</li><li> A forum user found the Summer 2016 update world before it was intended, containing some private info about the content of the update, such as a new pack, three new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Avatar">smileys</a>, and new white blocks.
</li><li> The Aviator, Sleepy, and Seagull smileys were discovered in August 2016 before their proper release.
</li><li> The then-hidden badge for the Summer campaign was found on the files of <em>Everybody Edits</em>'s website.
</li><li> In September 2016, info about the Mine Pack, Textile Backgrounds, and Restaurant Decorations were leaked in addition to an unfinished version of the update's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen">Loading Screen</a>.
</li><li> The November 2016 update was leaked, including the info of a Construction Pack, Black Aura, three new smileys, and an unfinished new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadingScreen">Loading Screen</a>.
</li><li> The Spy and Devil Skull smileys were leaked November 5, 2016. A day later, the Perpetual Frustration campaign was leaked, which would give out said Devil Skull smiley as a prize.
</li><li> The existence of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityScrew">gravity-flipping effect block</a> was leaked April 7, 2016 before it was added to the game.
</li></ul></li><li> During the initial launch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, dataminers found a huge list detailing every single planned character to be implemented along with a huge amount of leftover artwork and sprites that had yet to be implemented in the actual game, allowing the fanbase to predict when characters would be released and certain parts of the story long before it would actually happen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has content leaked nearly all the time thanks to people datamining the game after each major patch goes live. The reveal of new combat jobs and even new races were leaked from the dataminers. During the last major patch for the <em>Stormblood</em> expansion, there was a content leak by complete accident due to a glitch. A specific NPC in the French version of the game had a bug that had him list off every single playable race and it also included the yet revealed Hrothgar race, which completely spoiled the surprise before the reveal at the 2019 Toyko Fanfest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sometimes, updates containing new units are released slightly ahead of the units' reveal trailers. Naturally, this leads to some fans datamining these updates and finding said units, along with their stats and skills. For whatever reason, this typically happens with seasonal banners, such as Ylissean Summer and Bridal Blessings.
</li><li> Google Play has an achievement list that leaked the focus of a near-future banner before its trailer dropped. The achievement icon for clearing Chapter 13 Book II features Flora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fates</a></em> who at the time of discovery wasn't in game yet.

</li><li> The very existence of the Switch port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a></em> was prematurely revealed by mistake by a ratings board and a datamined eShop update, a few weeks before the official reveal at E3 2018.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> With the use of data mining, social network sites and community threads, A lot of players already knew that Olivia would become a playable character weeks before Cygames made the official annoucement of her release.
</li><li> An update in March 2018 accidentally opened a free raid quest meant for high-level players. It is playable for a few hours, but had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">numerous glitches</a> such as untranslated Japanese text, Uriel's art as a placeholder, very few attack scripts, and no loot rewards. The raid in question revealed that Shiva would become a raid boss battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cygames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cygames">Cygames</a> quickly advised players not to participate in the raid for the risk of player data corruption. It was removed the day after.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></em> has something of history of this.
<ul><li> Four legendary cards from <em>Goblins vs. Gnomes</em>, Hearthstone's first expansion, were leaked a few days before their official announcement. This worked out in Blizzard's favour however - all four had (for the time period) extremely unique effects, which led to most players dismissing them as fake. Queue the hype when they were actually real.
</li><li> A Chinese news site added information about the <em>Journey to Un'Goro</em> expansion before it was actually revealed. This included a shot of the card Amara, Warden of Hope as well as an explanation of the set's headline Quest mechanic.
</li><li> Photos of eight cards from <em>Galakrond's Awakening</em> made their way onto a Japanese site some time before release, including the Shaman legendary weapon The Fist of Ra-den.
</li><li> The largest one was arguably the <em>Ashes of Outland</em> leak in 2020. Polygon mistakenly published an article covering the Year of the Phoenix updates a day early, including information about the Priest overhaul and brand new Demon Hunter class, as well as the name of the next expansion (although none of the expansion's content). It was deleted within minutes, but the damage was done and Demon Hunters and most of their cards were public knowledge a day early.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em>: At the start of 2017, a list of every hero planned for the year was posted by an anonymous user. It turned out to be almost entirely correct in both which heroes and what order they'd be releasing in. The only error was missing Alexstrasza and Hanzo, and referring to Blaze as '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle">Firebat</a>' and pinning his release between Kel'Thuzad and Junkrat rather than at the start of 2018 (he was likely delayed).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hiveswap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hiveswap">Hiveswap</a></em> had almost <a class="urllink" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413346916429201408/413346923916034049/image.png">a third<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> of its Troll Call characters leaked <em>on the second week of the features</em>, due to a glitch on the site. This also revealed that the trolls had codenames of sorts that vaguely described their characters (e.g. Wanshi, a fan of reading, had the codename of "Book Girl").
</li><li> The existence of the upcoming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> universe RPG, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, was leaked in September 2018, two years before its official announcement. Allegedly the group performing a focus group about it in a mall didn&#146;t think to confiscate the participants&#146; phones and one of them recorded what was shown and then posted it on Reddit.
</li><li> The near-entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> was leaked over a month before its official release date, as people got early retail copies.

<ul><li> After the first wave of Dream Friends was released, the game was data-mined again, leading to the identities of the Dream Friends in the next two waves getting discovered and leaked months before their official announcement.
</li></ul></li><li> On April 27th, 2020, two weeks after it was delayed "indefinitely", entire scenes and the level selection of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUsPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUsPartII">The Last of Us Part II</a></em> was posted on Youtube. All in all, about two hours of the game was leaked. While this may not seem like a lot of a twenty-plus hour game, huge plot points (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like Joel's death</span>) were part of the leak and some other scenes came from very late in the game. It was rumored to be from a disgruntled employee who wanted to get back at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaughtyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaughtyDog">Naughty Dog</a> for their toxic work environment but their parent company, Sony Interactive Entertainment, has concluded it came from a third party. This caused massive backlash on social media criticizing the plot (and surely enough, the game became one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">contested sequels</a> in the video game medium upon release over this factor) and Naughty Dog's work environment. The videos were deleted soon after. Naughty Dog made a response to it and announced a new release date of June 19th on the official Playstation Twitter account hours later.
</li><li> A glitch in the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrangeBeforeTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LifeIsStrangeBeforeTheStorm">Life Is Strange: Before the Storm</a></em>'s second episode caused it to be briefly available a week early on Xbox Live, allowing some fans with preorders and fast internet connections to download and play it before it was fixed.
</li><li> All of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>'s DLC characters up to the <em>Aftermath</em> expansion except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop">RoboCop</a> were leaked by datamining of the Switch version upon the base game's release.
</li><li> The fan-game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyLittlePonyFightingIsMagic">My Little Pony: Fighting Is Magic</a></em> saw one of their earlier beta builds get leaked by one of its testers in late 2012, starting a chain of events that ultimately led to the game being nominated for EVO 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">which saw the game get slapped with a Cease and Desist letter.</a> Over the next few years, the project was retooled and eventually became known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemsFightinHerds">Them's Fightin' Herds</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioColorSplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioColorSplash">Paper Mario: Color Splash</a></em> was accidentally leaked on the Nintendo eShop when an error with digital pre-orders allowed players to access the full game two weeks ahead of its intended launch date, prompting Nintendo to pull the pre-order file down within a day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheOrigamiKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheOrigamiKing">Paper Mario: The Origami King</a></em> was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/rumour_prolific_leaker_says_well_get_paper_mario_and_a_2d_metroid_this_year">hinted at<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by Sabi (who was infamous for leaking numerous E3 2019 plans and almost leaked Nintendo&#146;s own plans before being stopped by lawyers) all the way back in January 2020.

</li></ul></li><li> An Amazon.com error with release dates resulted in some customers who had ordered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">"Showtime" Premium Edition</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQ2NewCinemaLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQ2NewCinemaLabyrinth">Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth</a></em> receiving it nearly two weeks in advance of its actual US release date. The cart was then subsequently dumped and uploaded to the internet before it was commercially available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> has had a variety of leaks throughout its lifespan:
<ul><li> Prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Generation VIII</a>, "hidden" event-exclusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> were discovered almost immediately after their debut games' release via datamining, such as Hoopa from <em>X and Y</em> and Marshadow from <em>Sun and Moon</em>. The tradition was killed off following the release of <em>Sword and Shield</em>, which introduced event-exclusive Pok&eacute;mon via software updates rather than having them buried within the data.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em> had two prototype versions leaked:
<ul><li> The Spaceworld 1997 demo got leaked in 2018. The game came out in 1999, so of course no new features were revealed, but there's plenty of very interesting things regardless; There's a lot of unused beta Pok&eacute;mon that were discarded, some of which have become popular and have fans demanding they be made official Pok&eacute;mon, and alternate prototype versions of existing Pok&eacute;mon, among other cut features.
</li><li> In April of 2020, the Spaceworld 1999 demo was leaked to the public. It was significantly closer to the final product than the '97 demo, but it still contained several removed features. Additionally, several beta designs, most notably of Wooper and Celebi, were found, along with a cut Girafarig pre-evolution and several crudely-drawn placeholder sprites.
</li></ul></li><li> A beta build of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> got leaked to the public, revealing cut designs, features, and music that was once tightly under wraps to the public.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em> ended up having almost the entirety of its Pokedex leaked by an unknown insider source. While the leaker didn't give names of the majority of the leaked creatures, they did leak their typings, as well as giving either vague descriptions of the Pok&eacute;mons' appearance or even an illustration of what they looked like.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em>:
<ul><li> The same leaker from the <em>Black and White</em> Pokedex leak struck again. While they didn't leak the majority of the Pokedex this time, they did disclose the advent of the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">Fairy-type</a>, the typings of the new Eeveelution Sylveon and the legendaries Xerneas and Yveltal (Fairy for the former two and Dark/Flying for the latter), and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconning</a> of previous Pok&eacute;mons' typings to Fairy, with mentions going to the Clefairy and Togetic lines.
</li><li> Some game stores in Canada and Italy ended up breaking the street date for these games and sold them early. Naturally, many fans ended up snagging these games while they could and leaked just about the entirety of them online. Also naturally, many of these fans ended up getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">takedowns from Nintendo/Game Freak</a>, though by the time the companies striked, the leaks were already in wide circulation, thus rendering their efforts pretty much futile.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> had its demo datamined. It didn't reveal too much notable information... except for a new, monstrous form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Mythical Pok&eacute;mon</a> Hoopa. Aside from that, however, not much information about the game was prematurely leaked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game's existence was leaked after Game Freak ended up placing trademarks on the logos. Additionally, the Japanese names for the three Starter Pok&eacute;mon, as well as the names of the cover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> and Marshadow were revealed in the trademark leak. Notably, Marshadow wouldn't be officially revealed for about a year after the official trademarking.
</li><li> Many snippets of the game's trailers ended up getting leaked before their release, revealing Pok&eacute;mon such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Tapu Koko</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey">Alolan Raichu</a>, and the remainder of the Grubbin line. These leaks caused the Japanese versions of said trailers to be released online ahead of their scheduled times.
</li><li> The designs for the evolutions of the three Starter Pok&eacute;mon were found in some <a class="urllink" href="https://nintendoeverything.com/wp-content/uploads/pokemon-sun-moon-starter-evolutions.jpg">leaked concept art<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. While initially met with skepticism, the reveal of Mallow, the girl shown in Incineroar's art, gave more credence to the leaks before they were finally verified via the game's demo getting datamined.
</li><li> As mentioned above, the game's demo ended up getting datamined. Inside the demo were images of all of the Pok&eacute;mon in the Alolan Pokedex, including the aforementioned starter evolutions and several other unreleased creatures.
</li><li> Like <em>X and Y</em> before it, some stores ended up breaking the release date for <em>Sun and Moon</em>, allowing a handful of fans to grab the game early and leak its content. However, advancements in the 3DS hacking scene caused the ROM to get leaked online, leading to many more fans playing the game before release. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">Obviously</a>, Nintendo did not take kindly to the ROM leak, and ended up console banning people who went online with illegal copies of the game. Amusingly, the original leaker got off scot-free while they watched fans rage over getting banned online.

However, due to the leak being on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a>, many fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">dismissed it as a joke</a> before it was officially revealed. An image of the protagonist on Lapras was also leaked months before reveal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game had a bunch of fake leaks going around. There is one however that leaked "Gigantamaxing" and the existence of the two wolf legendries, among other correct information, which leads credibility to their other not 100% confirmed claims. In August, their leaks of the two rivals and the villain team was also confirmed.
</li><li> Over the weekend of November 1st-3rd, just under two weeks before the game's release, screenshots both from the game and the strategy guide began flooding the internet, revealing basically the game's entire roster of Pok&eacute;mon (which was a lot, considering that far fewer Pok&eacute;mon had been officially revealed by that point as opposed to the run-up to previous game releases). The scale of these leaks as well as the increased scrutiny towards <em>Sword and Shield</em> that followed caused Nintendo to launch a full-blown investigation into the leaks, eventually tracing them to an employee for the Portuguese Nintendo fansite FNintendo, who had leaked the content from their review copy of the game. As a result, Nintendo permanently cut ties with the website, and the leaker was fired from their job.
</li><li> Less than a week before the release date, a store in Mexico broke the street date, resulting of videos of playthoughs of the game popping up.

(There's speculation that the reveal was pushed up as a response to said leak, as it ended up being the exact same day of a highly-anticipated stream announcing details about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">Mortal Kombat 11</a></em>.)

<ul><li> Toshihiro Nagoshi, the director for the first announcement trailer, revealed on the April 2019 Sega Nama stream that because of his initial unfamiliarity with the <em>Sakura Wars</em> series, he was the one who accidentally revealed that Sumire Kanzaki will be featured in the game.
</li><li> When Koch Media released the French trailer for the game, it was actually an earlier version which included a Christmas storyline as well as Kamiyama, Sakura and Clarisse discussing about the Flower Division's potential dissolution. They removed it not long after it was posted.
</li></ul></li><li> SEGA prematurely released an update for the PS4 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> that was intended to launch with the summer release of <em>Sonic Mania <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Plus</a></em> four months away. This included new animations, stage transitions and changes to a boss fight for the main game, but did not include the DLC exclusive to <em>Plus</em> such as the two new playable characters or the game's new "Encore Mode".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> updates are often partially spoiled by IQ Fleet, a group of players that mines pre-patch data to identify new ships or missions before their official unveiling. The official forums have a ban on linking to their website.

As a result, Yoshinori Ono apologized at EVO for not having any other major announcements for the game, asking the audience to wait for the end of the year for new announcements.
</li><li> Nintendo's plans for celebrating the 35th anniversary of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, which included a compilation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, were leaked back in early 2020.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> is notable for having fake leaks as part of the series' pre-release culture, largely because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover">the nature of the game</a> means that it's easy to slap together a fake roster full of characters people want for free attention. But sometimes, someone will strike gold and reveal what they know for that sweet, sweet internet cred. Here's some particularly notable ones:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></em>: The ChaosZero leak, where the user in question revealed, among other things, the addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">He was derided at first</a> due to having a reputation as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>, but as his leak steadily came true as more things were revealed, he would become known as the game's prophet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em>:
<ul><li> The controversial Gematsu leaks, where one of the site's writers reported information delivered to him regarding the game's roster, including the outlandish addition of the Wii Fit Trainer. The leak named several characters who would go on to be revealed, but was <em>brutally</em> discredited close to the game's release - it stated that Chrom from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> would be playable, but instead it was revealed that Robin and Lucina would be playable instead, Chrom appearing only as part of Robin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Final Smash</a>. In addition, another named character (the Chorus Men from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a></em>) ultimately ended up being a bust, though there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> files within the game that suggest they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">may have been scrapped</a>.
</li><li> The game had its pre-DLC roster and several gameplay screenshots leaked by a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ESRB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ESRB">ESRB</a>. Said roster also included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Shulk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Bowser Jr.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt">Duck Hunt</a>, who weren't revealed at the time. The rater would later face legal trouble because of it.
</li><li> The return of Roy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> and the addition of Ryu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> as DLC characters was spoiled by dataminers, who found songs in the game's files that named both characters long before they were announced. These songs ended up being their victory tunes when they were properly released.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many details about the game were spoiler prior to its unveiling at E3 by Vergeben, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> user. They cited that there were no cuts from <em>For 3DS/Wii U</em> and that the long-requested Ridley of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> fame would finally be playable. In addition, they correctly stated that Simon Belmont from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestFighter">Guest Fighter</a>, Isabelle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em> would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a>, Ken from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> would be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">Echo Fighter</a> for Ryu, Incineroar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em> would be the new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> character, there would be DLC (though this would have been an easy guess), the Hero from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> and the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> would be DLC characters and Terry Bogard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em> would be the DLC character implicated by Nintendo's copyright notice goof mentioned below. The only fighters new to <em>Ultimate</em> they failed to spoil up to the first DLC season pass were King K. Rool from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>, the Piranha Plant from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1egmw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1egmw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1egmw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">An anonymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a> poster did correctly state that the Plant would be announced alongside Ken and Incineroar as the last pre-release announcements, however... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">but absolutely no one paid attention to their post until well after the official announcement</a>, given the outrageous nature of a playable Piranha Plant in a fighting game.</span>, Joker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, Byleth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2unax');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2unax" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2unax');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">whose development was held in such secrecy that the only people privy to their existance were the development staff assigned to the character and Nintendo stockholders</span> and all of the Echo Fighters (save Ken). They have since gone silent on the second season pass.
</li><li> Another example coming from <em>Nintendo themselves</em>, of all places. The night before Simon was revealed, they accidentally renamed the YouTube video for the sample of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galaga">Galaga</a> Medley" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest">"Bloody Tears/Monster Dance"</a>, spoiling that <em>Castlevania</em> would at least be getting some kind of representation. As a result, subsequent YouTube uploads of soundtrack samples have incrementing numbers as upload names to prevent a second occurrence.
</li><li> On September 21, 2018, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/images/a/aa/SSBU_Ken_Screenshot_Leak.jpg">this image<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> of Ken was posted on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a> that caused a lot of debate on whether or not it was real, especially since the Ken model was never traced back to any existing ones. Sure enough, the November 1st, 2018 direct not only confirmed Ken, but the model from the pic as well.
</li><li> Two weeks before the release day, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">entire</a></em> game, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, was leaked onto the internet thanks to Nintendo sending early copies to a Mexican mom-and-pop store that ended up selling it prematurely, and was able to be illegally downloaded from online.
</li><li> On March 30, 2019, Best Buy's website featured an ad for the Fighter's Pass which included a never-before-seen Joker render. It was removed later the next day, which blatantly confirmed it was his official render placed in the ad by mistake.
</li><li> On April 9, 2019, a TV ad for the game briefly showed Stage Builder on a menu screen in the background, a mode which had since been missing from launch.
</li><li> On September 1st, 2019, it was discovered that certain branches of Nintendo listed <a class="urllink" href="https://archive.fo/CGDzT">a DLC page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the fourth DLC fighter that carried a copyright notice for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK">SNK</a>. It was taken down within a day, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NintendoDirect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NintendoDirect">Nintendo Direct</a> on the 4th revealed that said fighter was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Terry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">Bogard</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Instagram story of one of the developers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tamagotchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a></em>'s mobile game, <em>My Tamagotchi Forever</em>, showed an image of Mimitchi eating at a table a week before her addition to the game was announced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/TeamFortress2">Meet the Spy</a></em> video was accidentally leaked a day early due to a bug on YouTube that allowed iPhones to view videos marked as Private. Amusingly, this was referenced in the officially released version of the video, changing one of the panels on the alert board from "Lost Memory" to "Leaked Video".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxSeriesXAndS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxSeriesXAndS">Xbox Series X</a> console was long rumored to have a cheaper, less-powerful counterpart called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxSeriesXAndS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxSeriesXAndS">Xbox Series S</a>. The console variant's existence was then leaked via the packaging of the Xbox Series X controller. Then someone outright leaked an announcement trailer for the console early September 2020, forcing Microsoft to confirm it and the launch details of both Series S and Series X one week earlier than intended.
</li><li> In a truly bizarre example, a demo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza6">Yakuza 6</a></em> was released by Sega a few weeks prior to its April 2018 release. Said demo was basically the full game, but set to only allow the player to play so far (the idea being that they can keep their progress and pick up where they left off after buying the full game), but an exploit in the US PS4 release allowed players to continue past this point. Effectively, they leaked the full game themselves by mistake.

<h3><strong>By Network:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Full episodes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> shows have been hosted on its website since 2015, which were very susceptible to datamining until an early 2018 security patch. Screenshots and the first two minutes of basically <em>every</em> episode of every show would be leaked almost a week before the actual episode was meant to air/be viewable online.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> was a rather conspicuous case, as quite a few episodes (several of them highly-anticipated) were leaked before going to air:
<ul><li> "Fionna and Cake" and "Hot to the Touch" were leaked ilegally on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> days before their premiere. Fans in denial about the former's ending revealing that the genderbent characters were the product of Ice King's fanfiction actually believed it was a dupe intentionally leaked by the show staff to throw fans off of a massive plot twist (alas, what they saw was what they got come Labor Day 2011).
</li><li> Some members of 4chan managed to leak not only some clips from "The Lich" before its premiere, but also the first two episodes of Season 5, "Finn the Human" and "Jake the Dog".
</li><li> Some episodes from Season 5, such as "Up A Tree", "Bad Little Boy", "Simon and Marcy", "A Glitch is a Glitch" and "The Party's Over, Isla de Se&ntilde;orita" were all leaked before their respective airdates with the latter episode being uploaded by accident on iTunes.
</li><li> On December 2013, Cartoon Network listed eight episodes from the sixth season on their website, which not only spoiled the existence of Finn's father, but also revealed that Finn was going to lose his arm (though hardly anyone was surprised given how much foreshadowing it received).
</li><li> Weeks before "Breezy" premiered, an annonymous user leaked several animation cells for "Something Big" and "Furniture and Meat" on 4chan, which spoiled Root Beer Guy's death and Finn recovering his arm. Said user also leaked some episode titles, such as "Evergreen" and "Jake the Brick."
</li><li> On May 2015, Cartoon Network uploaded "Water Park Prank" (one of the episodes with a guest animator) on their website by accident, several weeks before its premiere.
</li><li> Thanks to the security breach mentioned above, the majority of the episodes from Season 7, including the "Stakes" miniseries, were all leaked to the public.
</li><li> Not an episode leak, but a leak nonetheless: on November 2017, a former member of the AT production crew posted a photo of a shirt on social media. Said shirt contained an official artwork related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>, showing Finn, Jake, Fern, BMO, LSP, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline, Normal Man, Ice King, Betty and the silhouette of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">GOLB</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series premiere was originally meant to be viewable on Nickelodeon's website before the TV premiere, but poor cyber-security (read: an administrative account <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePasswordIsAlwaysSwordfish">with a default username and password</a>) led it to be released early. The official website release was moved up in response.
</li><li> Weeks before the season three premiere, four episodes towards the middle of the season (out of thirteen total) were accidentally uploaded to the website of the Central American Affiliate , NickMundo. This lead to the TV premiere date being moved up, and the effect this had on the ratings is often blamed for the show's last season-and-a-half being released online-only.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>: The episodes "Future Tense", "Head Poet's Anxiety", "The Mad Scientist", "Tripped!" and "The Loudest Thanksgiving" were all leaked online before their official airdate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> There will be occasional times when episodes are posted to iTunes before hastily being taken down, but that usually results in the episode being downloaded and spread quickly. The first time this happened was "Hearts and Hooves Day".
</li><li> A few days before the Season 1 episode "Winter Wrap Up" aired, songwriter Daniel Ingram excitedly shared a video of his song from the episode before it aired, but Hasbro quickly made him take it down.
</li><li> An animator for Top Draw in the Philippines leaked Pinkie Pie's Smile Song (from "A Friend in Deed") a few months before the episode aired, but just the audio and in a poor-quality mono mix. Daniel Ingram wasn't happy.
</li><li> The digital masters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017">My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)</a></em> leaked just as it was about to hit theaters. Probably a good thing in this case, since somewhere along the line the visuals were messed with by adding a vignette.
</li><li> During Season 7, several later episodes of the season were leaked online prior to their official air dates.
</li><li> During the Season 7-8 hiatus, Hasbro suffered two larger-scale leaks that saw the leaks of unfinished Season 8 episodes, a new title sequence, a tentative timetable for future fourth generation happenings, titles and plot description reveals for <em>every Season 8 episode</em>, and very early concept art and ideas for a possible fifth generation. Ultimately, all of the content of this leak proved to be genuine, with the only part that can't be officially verified being the concept art.
</li><li> During the middle of Season 9, a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.equestriadaily.com/2019/08/the-dutch-my-little-pony-season-9.html?m=1">Dutch streaming service<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> leaked the entire rest of the season, including the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, by mistake.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls">My Little Pony: Equestria Girls</a></em> short "Five Lines You Need To Stand In" was leaked online a month before its' official release.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> has been through this a few times:
<ul><li> The new opening sequence starting from the third season was shown at a convention, and despite being told specifically <em>not</em> to share it online, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">someone filmed it and shared it anyway</a>. Sometime later, a better quality version was officially released online, but that might have just been because of the leak.
</li><li> During the two weeks of daily new episodes in November 2017, images from "Demoncism", "Sophomore Slump", and later "Night Life" and "Deep Dive" somehow found their way online, and contained quite a few spoilers for what would happen in each episode. A few weeks later, some images from "Stump Day" were also leaked, along with part of the episode's transcript, about a day or two before the episode was released.
</li><li> It happened again with the <em>very</em> controversial "Booth Buddies," where images from the episode were leaked online, as well as part of the script.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> has a history of its content being leaked, accidentally or intentionally, from episode titles and screenshots to entire episodes. To the point where there's an entire <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SULeaks/">subreddit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> dedicated to them. As mentioned above, it was standard for at least screenshots of episodes of Cartoon Network shows to leak a few hours before airing for seasons two through the first half of five.
<ul><li> Early in the show's first season, the episode listing on Cartoon Network's website accidentally listed titles and description for every episode in its 52 episode season, giving away a lot about the general trajectory of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> almost a year in advance.
</li><li> A similar event occurred early in the second season, giving away the titles (though not descriptions) for every episode in the rest of season two, all of season three (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E20Bismuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E20Bismuth">"Bismuth"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerTitle">thankfully!</a>), and even four episodes of season <em>four</em>.
</li><li> Towards the end of season two, Cartoon Network accidentally aired a promo which showed a clip from the following season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E4BarnMates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E4BarnMates">"Barn Mates"</a>, where Peridot was presenting Lapis with a gift. This leak came at a time when Lapis was still fused as Malachite deep in the ocean.
</li><li> In February 2016, Cartoon Network UK accidentally leaked pretty much the entirety of the Malachite vs. Alexandrite battle in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E1SuperWatermelonIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E1SuperWatermelonIsland">"Super Watermelon Island"</a>, <em>three months</em> before the episode officially aired in the US.
</li><li> The scene from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E4BarnMates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E4BarnMates">"Barn Mates"</a> involving the arrival of the Roaming Eye was also leaked by Cartoon Network UK at the same time as the Malachite vs. Alexandrite battle.
</li><li> Four weeks before the five-episode <em>Out of This World</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3dfzb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3dfzb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3dfzb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E10StevensDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E10StevensDream">"Steven's Dream"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E11AdventuresInLightDistortion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E11AdventuresInLightDistortion">"Adventures in Light Distortion"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E12GemHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E12GemHeist">"Gem Heist"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E13TheZoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E13TheZoo">"The Zoo"</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E14ThatWillBeAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E14ThatWillBeAll">"That Will Be All"</a></span> aired, all five episodes were posted on Cartoon Network's website and certain on-demand services without any buildup. Within a day, most sources removed all but the first episode. While one network representative claimed they were released deliberately to promote the network's streaming services (something that's since become a regular occurrence with many of its shows), the sudden release and retraction has lead many to believe only the first was meant to be put up, while the rest were an accident.
</li><li> A low-resolution version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E20Lion4AlternateEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS4E20Lion4AlternateEnding">"Lion 4: Alternate Ending"</a> was leaked online by a child recording the episode from his On Demand service about a month before it actually aired.
</li><li> During the initial run of <em>War Paint</em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/6fymsf/white_diamond_va/">a fan of the show who watched the performance<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> complimented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattiLuPone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattiLuPone">Patti LuPone</a> on both her performance in the musical and as Yellow Diamond. Patti thanked the fan and said "Christine [Ebersole] plays White Diamond!", something <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEd5QQIXNBY">Christine herself confirmed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at a <em>War Paint</em> signing in July 2017, almost a year before White Diamond was even mentioned in the show, much less spoke.
</li><li> In January 2018, four months before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E17CantGoBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E17CantGoBack">"Can't Go Back"</a> aired, Lapis' European Portuguese VA V&acirc;nia Blubird posted an already dubbed clip of the episode's song, "That Distant Shore", to her Instagram Story, which was supposed to be private. <em>All</em> her posts were deleted shortly after the news spread, and the VA in question was fired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">and replaced</a>.
</li><li> On May 1st, 2018, Cartoon Network took it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and released clips in a documentary podcast from the final episodes of the fifth season, revealing <em><strong>massive</strong></em> spoilers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E24LegsFromHereToHomeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E24LegsFromHereToHomeworld">"Legs From Here to Homeworld"</a> (which wouldn't officially air on TV until <em>December</em>), along with clips from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E20WhatsYourProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E20WhatsYourProblem">"What's Your Problem?"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E21TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E21TheQuestion">"The Question"</a> (which wouldn't air until July) in a move deemed to be done by "some careless jerk who doesn't even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atlanta">work in our timezone</a>" by one of the show's former producers, Ian Jones-Quartey. The video was quickly taken down from YouTube for re-editing and some members of the staff issued apologies on Twitter, but by then the spoilers were everywhere.
</li><li> In conjunction with the final two arcs, Spotify was supposed to release the lyrical songs the day after the episodes featuring them aired. Instead, they were uploaded the day <em>before</em>, thus giving unintentional sneak peaks into the plot. Similarly, those following the <em>Steven Universe</em> feed following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E25Familiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E25Familiar">"Familiar"</a> were notified of the song <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E27Escapism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS5E27Escapism">"Escapism"</a> going on preorder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheCastList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheCastList">which unfortunately listed the singer</a>, something that was kept secret up to that point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">The Movie</a>:
<ul><li> On August 6, 2019 (over three weeks prior to the movie's September 2 premiere), a snippet from a documentary about the movie's production was put up on Cartoon Network's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel, then taken down an hour later because a drawing in the background gave away the villain's name, Spinel ("Your new worst enemy, <em>Spinel</em>"), which had been kept secret up to that point. Shortly after, it was discovered that the servers for the movie's official website had an image of that same name (at the time, the website used four question marks to hide her identity on the characters tab), confirming it was indeed her true name.
</li><li> A partial YouTube listing for the movie, also released on August 6, included a few voice actors, directors, and producers in the credits that hadn't been officially revealed at the time of the listing's posting.
</li><li> The soundtrack title list was leaked on Apple Music a couple days before the movie's release, with fans who indulged in leaks theorizing on what the titles meant and what type of songs they'd be, and whether they'd heard the song before in the trailers. Humorously, almost everyone thought that "system/BOOT.pearl_final(3).Info" was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle">Working Title</a>, or a glitch in wherever the original files were found &#151; only to learn when the soundtrack officially released that <em>that's actually what the song's title is</em>.

<ul><li> "Snow Day" was accidentally put on the Google Play store mere hours before its premiere on TV.
</li><li> On January 11th, 2020, a minute-long audio clip<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note48qj3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note48qj3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note48qj3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Voice acting only (no sound effects), which is somewhat drowned out by added music.</span> from "Fragments" was discovered on dbree.org (titled "SU EPIC LEAK.mp3"), that had actually been uploaded on November 30th, 2019 (a week before the show had even premiered).
</li><li> On February 13th, 2020, a leaked clip of Steven's voice from "Growing Pains" and an incredibly low quality video clip from "I Am My Monster" was briefly featured in a video by a Spanish YouTube channel.
</li><li> On February 22nd, 2020, a leaked audio clip mostly drowned out by hip-hop music from "Together Forever" was discovered on wi.to, titled "THE_JAJAS_ARE_RIGHT_AGAIN.mp3".
</li><li> A majority of the most spoilery plot points from the second half of the series were leaked by a Spanish Twitter user over the course of a few weeks before the final episodes aired, to the point where they <em>got blocked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebeccaSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebeccaSugar">Rebecca Sugar</a> herself</em> after the show concluded its run.
</li><li> During mid-September 2020, <em>many</em> pages from the "End of an Era" artbook were leaked onto the internet one month before it officially came out thanks to people bypassing the Amazon previews limitations.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Eden Espinosa, who voices Cassandra on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em>, accidentally showed on her Instagram the title of a season 3 episode called <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Cassandra's Revenge"</span>, spoiling the big twist of the season 2 finale a good 8 months before it aired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>: The episodes "Animals: It's Just A Word", "Top Of The Titans: Raddest Songs", "Butt Atoms", "Record Book" and "Bat Scouts" were leaked online weeks before they actually aired.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>:

A different person refused to delete their copy of the images on Twitter in an attempt to blackmail DreamWorks into making the Keith/Lance ship canon.
</li><li> Certain stills from the series finale were leaked three months before Season 8 had aired.
