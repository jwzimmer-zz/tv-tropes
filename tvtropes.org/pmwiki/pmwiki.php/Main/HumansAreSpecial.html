This is not particularly improbable; after all, assuming they're not the very first race in the universe to make the leap, any race that just got space travel recently &mdash; which is usually the timeframe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a> focuses on, since it's easier for us to relate to &mdash; is going to initially be the "new kids" on the galactic scene, encountering tons of other races that have had far longer to get their things together. Even if other aliens aren't super-advanced, if you have lots of different spacefaring races in your setting, you still end up with humanity just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HufflepuffHouse">one non-notable race among thousands</a>, but the problem is, these things are actually being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">written by humans, for humans</a>, and that usually means people want to see humans in an important, overarching role. To accomplish this, it is made clear that there is something <em>special</em>, something unique about the human character. It could be that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreGood">humans are inherently noble, kind and idealistic</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSpirit">that we never</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">ever give up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">no matter how bad things get</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">we are extremely curious and love adventure</a> or simply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">our very emotions</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">are our</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerofLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerofLove">strength</a>. Whatever the case may be, humans are usually given some Western, humanistic value that somehow allows us to transcend our weaknesses and earn the admiration and/or fear of other, more advanced civilizations. Apparently everyone else is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">stuck in a rut</a>, possibly as a result of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a>.

Though, to be fair, it's highly likely that any other intelligent species that evolved through natural selection would also instinctively see themselves as being the best, and many of their science fiction works (or equivalent) would have the same trope for their species.
</p><p>In extreme cases, fantasy writers have depicted humans as (morally) superior to the gods. This is easily accomplished by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">having the gods acting like two-year-olds, and badly brought up two-year-olds at that</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, Alucard rather admires humanity to a point, though he generally makes a distinction between "human dogs", "humans who become monsters" and "real humans".
<ul><li> Alucard has pointed out (at least in the manga) that only a human can kill a monster (referring to himself). So humans are, if nothing else, significant. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Father Anderson gives up his humanity and becomes a monster, Alucard is horrified. Not from fear of being defeated, but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">the human he thought might be the one worthy to kill him</a> has thrown it all away.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Sora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em> explores this concept. He firmly believes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">Humans Are Flawed</a> and has become disillusioned with humanity in general, but he also believes in humanity's potential and what greatness it is able to achieve. In one of the most unusual instances of this trope, while addressing Imanity (Disboard's humans) in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> he cites how humans have been outclassed by all the other races and are the weakest of all, <em>but then</em> he turns it around and declares it is <em>being weak</em> that is what makes humans special.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Sora</strong>: Why is it that this whole continent once ruled by humans? Is it because we are a species that specializes in violence? We can't use magic like the elves, nor are we physically strong like the warbeast nor do we have the longevity of the Flugel. Why were we able to rule this continent? Is it because we are master of war? I tell you it's not! We fought and survived because we are weak! In every time, in every world.. The strong polishes their fangs while the weak polish their wisdom. Why are we in such danger now? Because the ten pledges have broken the fangs of the strong, they have learned to polish their wisdom. The wisdom and strategies that we the weak, once monopolized... The power to survive... The strong have gained them all! And brought us to this state! <br>We are the weak! We are the weak, just as we have always been! Yes, nothing has changed at all! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">The strong may imitate our weapons, but they will never master them</a>! Because at the hearts of our weapons lies the cowardice born of almost humiliating weakness. This cowardice has given us the wisdom to escape from magic. This cowardice has given us the wisdom, born from learning, and the experience to predict the future itself! I say for the third time, we are the weak! We are the proud weak who throughout history, who torn out the throats of those who sit back and boast out their strength! <br>We hereby declare that we will live as the weak, fight as the weak, and as the weak we will destroy the strong! As we once were and as we will always be. Accept the fact that we are the weakest race. Accept that we are the weakest race, one that can become anything, because we are born with nothing!

Ed is so incisive and accurate that Envy decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">kill himself</a>.</span>
</li><li> A chapter of the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> has a minor goddess visiting Earth go into raptures when she gets to taste "Earth's famous soft-serve ice cream!" They don't have ice cream in Heaven? Then what's the point of going there? For that matter, Peorth returned to Heaven with a lot of games and books she'd picked up during her stay on Earth, and was asked not to do that again, because so many of the other goddesses were distracted from their duties. Apparently we can create entertainment that the deities just can't match.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> invokes a variation upon this, explicated in the extra materials from the PS2/PSP video game <em>Neon Genesis Evangelions</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Humans" are effectively a special kind of life form that includes the Milky Way's first intelligent species (the First Ancestral Race), along with the Seeds of Life (Adam, Lilith, etc.) and the races they birthed on other worlds (Lilin, Angels, etc.). Furthermore, the FAR didn't just create the Seeds and send them off to do their thing; they went physically extinct to provide the souls for them and their offspring.</span> Humans really are special...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeroicAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeroicAge">Heroic Age</a></em>: Humanity was the last species to respond to the Golden Tribe's call to leave our homeworld for the greater galaxy, but we were the only ones who did it entirely under our own power (the Silver, Bronze, and Heroic Tribes all had a bit of assistance from the Golden). Even among the four who responded, we're the only ones who consider our past to be important, rather than focusing exclusively on the future... a trait that the Golden Tribe also possessed. We were also the only species besides the Silver Tribe to be assigned a Nodos in the Golden Tribe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to stabilize the galaxy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em>, only humans can hear the sound made by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a>' power. This was an addition made to the dub to fully justify the continued presence of the human companions after their initial usefulness as native guides largely ended. With this worked in, the Autobots had a legitimate need for the whole trio of Coby, Bud, and Lori to stay on and accompany them on search missions. They don't seek assistance from other humans because that would risk completely blowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> and causing mass panic. Optimus Prime is perfectly aware that most humans would tend freak out about the presence of thousands of Super Robot refugees. So contact was initially limited to the three who had already found out (and had assisted an injured Autobot).
</li><li> It seems that humans get the short end of the stick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">their short lifespans</a>, but because they don't live very long, they improve much more quickly.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Well, humanity <em>is</em> one of the few races not to give into the insanity surrounding the Winslow and realise that, indestructibility aside, it's just a silly, harmless little animal and not some all-important <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>.</span>

This is justified in a canon DCU story where it is revealed that life on Earth was originally meant to evolve a godlike, superpowered race, which ultimately ended up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">humans</a> because of genetic experiments performed by aliens in its early history. Nevertheless many humans retain the genetic potential to awaken superpowers, which is why Earth has so many superheroes. Other examples from both companies are below.
<ul><li> The other way humans are special is diversity. This is perhaps lampshading the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a> phenomenon among other species.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> comics, the Guardians of the Universe pick out humanity as one of the next few species to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>, and note that humans make wonderful Green Lanterns.

</li><li> Note that was the opinion of the original Guardians. The <em>new</em> Guardians of the Universe think that, while Earth has has some imagination and great will, humans are stupid savages (like other races who hear about Earth), despite most of the reality bending stuff being related to them. The two Guardians who disagree with this opinion are Ganthet (who is the last original Guardian) and Sayd (who is his lover and seen how good humans can be firsthand), but are now exiled from the rest. The reason being that they "coddle humans too much" and for thinking that being emotionally detached from everything is bad (which has been shown to be true).

<ul><li> When an alien conqueror sets his sights on conquering Earth.

He quickly u-turns his ships and flees, fearing a species capable of that kind of defense.
</li><li> This happened a second time, in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> parody of the DC series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Invasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Invasion">Invasion!</a></em>. A group of aliens move to invade the world of 'Australia', and only one does the research. He finds out that the planet has hosted several people who can harness the Phoenix Force, have fought off Galactus, beaten back the Skrulls, once hosted the Silver Surfer, etc. He ran to alert his superiors. They shot him for interrupting, claimed that whatever he said couldn't have been that important, and proceeded to have their invasion fleet wiped out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Colossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Colossus">Colossus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Longshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Longshot">Longshot</a>, a drunken Havok, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>.
</li><li> Played for laughs a second time when aliens challenge Earth's greatest heroes (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WestCoastAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WestCoastAvengers">West Coast Avengers</a>) to battle with their robot to test their strength. After all of the Avengers kill the self-repairing robot one after another, we find that the aliens assume that all 6 billion humans are a composite of the 6 members of the WCA, with all their powers combined, and instantly rethink their invasion plan.
<ul><li> This is based on a number of older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> Stories where a superhero fights off an alien invasion, and the aliens flee, thinking that all humans are like this, or in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s case, that the humans have an army of robots.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> Galactus is defeated, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> says it makes him feel like he can challenge God.

Based on his past defeat at the hands of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, as well mankind's rapid technological advancement during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwentiethCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTwentiethCentury">The 20th Century</a>, Ronan came to the conclusion that if left unchecked, Earth would eventually become a major threat to the Kree and their star-spanning empire. He was ultimately proven right during the finale, when the Supreme Intelligence allowed former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagAlongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagAlongKid">Tag Along Kid</a> Rick Jones to access the immense power that is supposedly buried within all of humanity, which Rick then quickly used to stop the warring Kree and Skrull armies.
</li><li> Uatu, a member of the ancient Watcher race, is convinced that humanity is innately noble, to the point he broke his non-interference vow to help save them from Galactus, the Planet Eater. After being put in trial for this, he has <em>pretended</em> to not care about humans anymore... but always manages to <em>indirectly</em> aid when needed, such as the time he tricked another Cosmic Entity (The Stranger) into not killing a group of superheroes, simply by showing up to "observe" the event, which led The Stranger to conclude Uatu would not have bothered unless the humans were going to win anyway.
</li><li> Speaking of the Stranger, he deconstructs the trope after acknowledging humanity as a threat for their successes in thwarting or repelling cosmic entities and much older galaxy-spanning empires along with their species' capacity to develop superpowers. To this end, he conducts "experiments" that just so happen to put the Earth at immense risk of destruction in indirect attempts to end humanity.
</li><li> A Marvel short story had an alien marvel (pun not intended) at the attention such a fragmented backwater like Earth received. It could be the only world in the known galaxies that produces the delicacy "ice cream." The alien in question is a trader who buys the stuff by the tanker-full.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a></em> has this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainMarVell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainMarVell">Captain Mahr Vell</a> in the <em>Ultimate Secret</em> arc. He defects to the humans partly because of their enjoyable (American) culture, including Krispy Kreme donuts.
</li><li> This was a major plot point in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersForever">Avengers Forever</a></em>. Essentially, if humans were allowed to reach and colonize space, they would quickly conquer it. Thus, everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a>'s ability to open portals getting stolen to killing the Supreme Intelligence during <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OperatingGalacticStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OperatingGalacticStorm">Operating Galactic Storm</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheCrossing">The Crossing</a></em> was an effort by Immortus to keep humans on Earth.
</li><li> It really came to a head in <em>Maximum Security</em>, in which the aliens of the Marvel Universe turn Earth into a prison to keep the humans busy.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Infinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Infinity">Infinity</a></em>, Emperor J'son of Spartax dismisses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and humanity as a whole, telling them to go away until cannon fodder is required.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, humans (the few that remain) are not only special among other races, but the forefathers of literally every other race in the universe.
</li><li> Prime example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>: Humans are the dominant race in the galaxy, with the Jaffa running a close second. Of course, it is worth noting that the Jaffa are themselves an offshoot of humanity, bred by the Goa'uld thousands of years ago to suit their purposes. Every other race they meet is either extremely arrogant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, has questionable morals, or are otherwise 'inferior' to humans. Probably the only exception are the Asgard, who also owe their their lives to the humans <em>multiple times</em>, despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>; and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they commit species-scale suicide at the end anyway</span>. Even the Ancients themselves (also humans, of a "previous evolution", who actually bootstrapped the evolution of humans on Earth), while being the show's legendary race and "gods" who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended to a higher plane of existence</a>, are labeled as wrong in their morals, for the most part. (They are so adamantly against interfering with the mortal plane that they would sooner allow all life in the galaxy to be destroyed than step in.) Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">Rousseau Was Right</a>.
<ul><li> Earth Humans specifically, commonly referred to as the Tau'ri, are particularly special. In the Milky Way galaxy, almost every planet is hindered in advancement by the Goa'uld except for Earth and a few others, which got a chance to develop freely. Other unhindered worlds are often beyond Earth standards technologically, but the Tau'ri are notable for their determination. The situation with the Wraith in the Pegasus galaxy is similar, where their feeding on humans limits the population growth of most societies. So, in the end it's not so much "humans are special" but "Earthlings are special".
</li><li> More to the point, there's very few other species than humans. The only major ones are Wraith (who are revealed to be part human anyway), Goa'uld, and Asgard. A few others exist, but 95% of everyone is a human or a related species in the three known galaxies. Earth Humanity is special because we have the ATA Gene, and the main reason for that is because we're the most crowded planet in the three galaxies. Human settlements of a few hundred to thousand is the norm, and the ATA gene is recessive.
<ul><li> In fairness, there is a very good reason for human domination, and it's based around a completely different species. The dominant species for thousands of years have been the Goa'uld, a race of mind-controlling megalomaniacal parasites. The first species they possessed en masse were the Unas. A far larger, more intimidating and all-around more powerful species blessed with both huge endurance and natural self-healing (which the Goa-uld's own supplemented perfectly). Humans are in comparison weak, frail and pathetic, but they also have superior senses of taste and touch, and aren't as ugly. The Goa'uld, being gluttonous hedonists focused on power, food and sex, decided to make humans their slave race for few other reasons than these. They seeded humans across the stars en masse for use as slaves and worshippers, and killed off any other species (or any humans that got too advanced) to protect their own seats in the galaxy. When inevitably their empire fell, the humans were already everywhere. Less a case of humans special, more a case of humans getting vaguely lucky the Goa'uld invested so much in them before finally being kicked out of power.

Likewise, in addition to Starfleet crews apparently being mostly human, Federation starships follow human design paradigms.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, humanity is special because they are the only creatures made in the image of God (one Psalm specifically states that we're just "a little lower than angels" and this is about fallen mankind, judging by entire context. In other psalm, God literally calls humans "gods" and "sons of most high", the phrase that is recited by Jesus in John 10). And humans are meant to rule entire creation and one deuterocanonical book (Esdras 8:44) outright states that everything was made for mankind. And everything is for mankind part is repeated several times indirectly by Paul (ex: in Hebrews 1:14: Are they [angels] not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?.) And the most important part of Christianity: Jesus, who was fully God and Human and is called "Second Adam". Let that sink in: God is a Human.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a> has it that God ordered angels to bow to Adam, and Satan refused because clay is inferior to fire. That's right, according to this story, disagreeing with this trope makes you irredeemably evil and deserving of Hell.
</li><li> Certain branches of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> hold humans as the ideal form to try and achieve Buddha-nature. They lack the distracting luxuries and powers of godhood, possess the intellect lacking by animals, and are not burdened by the pain found in the realms of the Hungry Ghosts or hell.
</li><li> Contrary to many modern religions or fantasy genres where humans are better than virtually every other race or somehow special, this trope is averted in many ancient religions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Ancient Greek religion</a> regarded humans as far below the gods and in some ways worse off than animals since they lack the powers of a god, but also lack the ignorance of an animal, leaving them to live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> and know about it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/MesopotamianMythology">Mesopotamian Mythology</a> has humanity created by the gods to be a force of slave labor so the gods can live a life of luxury.
</li><li> Depending on religious beliefs, a human could be anything from the most advanced life form on the planet to a creature made in God's image to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a god himself</a></em>.
<ul><li> According to some religions like Ancient Greek, humanity can out do even the gods in their specialties. Our problem is that kind of power comes with quite a bit of pride.
</li><li> According to some religions, the cosmos was literally made for us. How's that for special?
</li><li> On the other hand, Hinduism puts us below cows on the karma ladder, and in certain cases monkeys and even rats.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> has a certain opposing view between the mages of the libertarian Free Council and the authoritarian Silver Ladder. The Free Council mages believe Humans Are Special, with human works and endeavors containing arcane knowledge. The Silver Ladder mages believe humans aren't special, but that they <em>should be</em>, and being denied the arcane power they deserve is the ultimate crime.
<ul><li> Also, *collective* humanity pretty easily trumps mages both individually and collectively. They're no longer the bedrock that holds the consensus together as in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em>, but they're still the source of Paradox (the force that causes magic to backlash and fail) and they have the most powerful and magically valuable souls in the setting short of possibly the Magi themselves, in a setting where souls are a very real and powerful force.
</li></ul></li><li> A big one is that only a human has the capacity to become a mortal Demiurge. The supernatural races can't create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean</a> because they lack human passion, or have powers that would tend to shortcut the drive and obsession necessary to pull it off.

(Which is why the aliens go there.)
<ul><li> Humans also have the ability to "fake out", i.e. convince an alien of just about anything, like draping carpets over your head makes for impressive evening wear, or that kissing is a perfectly socially acceptable way of greeting anyone. After all, humans are the coolest species in the universe, so they should <em>know</em>, right?
</li><li> It seems humanity is the only species to actually invent popular culture/entertainment at all. Hence, we have the best music, movies, clothes, soft drinks, etc. and any alien species will either import what humans invented in this line, or copy it.

This is in spite of the fact that Chaos has existed long before humanity has been around, most of the gods themselves having been around since well before humanity's rise on the galactic scene, and at least one was birthed by the collective hedonism (not worship) of an entirely different species.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> humans are treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">foolish and immature</a> due to their abbreviated lifespans. Yet, they're truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">capable of anything</a>, as the rapid pace of their lives leads them to be quickly adaptable as a race, and driven to professional excellence as individuals.
<ul><li> In 1st and 2nd edition, they had no special abilities whatsoever, but could run the full range of ability scores, could belong to any class, and had no limit to what level they could gain in their class. Other races could belong to two classes at once in predetermined combinations, but only humans could change their classes after creation (although it was a pretty grueling process, requiring you to start from scratch until you regained the level you switched at).
</li><li> On another note, in the earliest editions, humans DID have a class only THEY could obtain. Paladins were originally locked off from all other races. Paladin class features were uniquely powerful, and had weapons no other class could use. The only offset was the obscenely high stats required to roll such a character.
</li><li> In 3rd edition, humans again have no special racial powers, but instead gain a bonus feat of their choosing and can develop an extra skill, allowing them to excel right from the start. While other races have specific favored classes that don't count against multiclassing penalties, a human's favored class is whatever class he has the most levels in, making multiclassing a bit easier.
</li><li> In 4th edition, other races get bonuses to two predetermined ability scores and two predetermined skills, 2-4 passive abilities, and a bonus activated power (normally an 'encounter' power). Humans get a bonus to only one ability score, none as such to skills, and only a small bonus to all non-armor defenses as a true 'racial' ability...but by being able to assign that ability score bonus to whichever ability they choose and start out with training in an extra class skill, a bonus feat, and an extra first-level at-will attack power from their class list (which is a pretty big deal as for most classes this means going from having two such convenient always-ready attack modes available <em>ever</em> to having three), they can be easily competent in any class of their liking whereas other races' perks tend to encourage them to stick to the niches they're 'naturally' best suited for. They also get feats that are useful for anyone such as "human perserverence" and "stubbon servior". Humans are special in fourth and maybe third!
<ul><li> As of Essentials humans now have a true racial ability "Heroic Effort". With it if you miss with an attack or fail a saving throw you can add a +4 bonus to the roll but you must give up the bonus at-will to get it. A good power, but if it is better then the bonus at-will or not is up to you.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>, as D&amp;D 3.75, gives humans an absolutely amazing racial power. Like in 3.5, humans have an extra skill point per level and an extra feat. Humans also have no ability score penalty and a +2 to any one stat, allowing them to be amongst the best at every single class. There's no natural proclivity to lack in the area for a single class. Since ability scores are purchased in a non-linear fashion, making up for a racial deficiency is quite costly.
</li><li> In 5th edition, instead of getting a bonus to 2 stats like most other races (generally a +2 and a +1), humans default to being well rounded and getting a +1 to all of their stats. The book also includes a variant option: pick any two scores to get a +1, and start the game with a feat. It should be noted that in this edition feats are rarer, and any other race has to forgo gaining an ability score increase 3 levels later to even have the option of picking one; feats are also a lot more flavorful, giving more customized builds. This means that while technically any race can be any class (with varying degrees of competency), humans can be suited to whichever path they decide to go down.
</li><li> All these examples ignore an additional trait humans have; they have no particular enemies or hatreds. If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> is the hacky-slashy kind that doesn't take into account role playing motivations, it's useless, but if (s)he does, then every PC who isn't human is going to run into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> which makes certain NPC or Monster creatures hostile right off the bat. If the GM really pays attention, it can even be a combat advantage.
<div class="indent"> Dwarf: "Why are the orcs all after <em>me</em>?"
</div></li><li> From another, more disturbing perspective, it's worth pointing out that in the Book of Erotic Fantasy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1d3oe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1d3oe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1d3oe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(yes, <em>Erotic</em>, you did read that right)</span> it is heavily implied that humans are the only species besides dragons that can mate with <em>anything</em> and produce viable offspring. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Every race has a hat</a>, and ours is that we <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Get Around</a>.
</li><li> Humans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> have the most dragonmarks, magical, heritable marks that provide great gifts within a specific field. Most races get either one mark (gnomes with Scribing, dwarves with Warding) or two (half-elves with Detection and Storm, halflings with Healing and Hospitality, elves with Shadow and Death, although the latter is extinct), and changelings, kalashtar, shifters and most of the "exotic" races (dragonborn, tieflings, aasimar, whatever else your DM lets you run) don't get any at all. Humans get <em>four</em> to themselves - Making, Handling, Passage and Sentinel - plus the Mark of Finding, which they share with half-orcs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EarthDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EarthDawn">Earth Dawn</a></em> is unique in that humans are mysterious nomads, of which the other races are wary. Their racial powers are nearly nonexistent, save for their ability to crib abilities from other classes.
<ul><li> Also the other races might be effectively mutations of humanity caused by increasing magic in the world, making humans "special" by virtue of being everyone else's progenitors.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SLAIndustries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SLAIndustries">SLA Industries</a></em> where humans are even less special than the sewer-dwelling mutants, have no homeworld and seem to be kept around for the novelty value (and for a cheap workforce).
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>; the very thing that makes humanity Special and allowed them to rise up to overthrow the Primordials at the behest of the gods is that they were NOT special; humanity was created as a servant race -to- the servant race of gods, weaker than almost everything else in the world, barely capable of using the magic of Essence. A mayfly race intended to be born, pray, and die, totally dependent upon the gods, providing them with needed power through prayer, so the gods would serve the Primordials. As a result ... binding them into servitude was deemed unnecessary, and when they were given power by the gods, they were able to rise up and throw down the Primordials. Humanity is Special specifically because Humans Suck, in effect.
<ul><li> Also, Graceful Wicked Masques implies that humans have a much greater capacity for imagination and creativity than anything else in the setting...but these qualities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">tend to attract the attention of the Fair Folk while granting no real defense against them</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The human creature type in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> is a relatively new addition to the game. Previously it was simply ommited for the fact that humans run the full gamut of colors, classes and power and have no synergy with each other.
<ul><li> Even after our addition to the game lore, the human race plays a mostly insignificant role in most settings (the occasional legendary human in a given set might as well be replaced by any other creature); interestingly enough, most Planeswalkers (both in-game and lore-exclusive) are humans despite there being no mention at all about humans being special in any given way (other than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">writers being human themselves</a>).
</li><li> On the other hand, it's noteworthy that humans are one of the very few races to exist in meaningful numbers across all five colors, giving them unparalleled diversity and adaptability.
</li><li> Humans are the only non-monstrous intelligence to be able to even <em>survive</em> on the Gothic horror world of Innistrad; the lore indicates that it <em>used</em> to have elves, but they're extinct. The rest of the major forces more or less require humanity to exist: vampires need them to feed and reproduce, werewolves arise from among humans, and zombies and spirits are born from dead humans, meaning that keeping humanity around is pretty important for the plane to continue having, you know, <em>stuff</em> on it. As a result, Sorin Markov created the angel Avacyn to protect humanity from the forces that prey on it. Notably, Innistrad is one of the few planes where the Human creature type keeps being referenced by cards that care about it (<a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227405">albeit sometimes as lunch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice">Dragon Dice</a></em> has only one race/army representing humanity - the Amazons. They are the only race to have been created solely by the male creation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">deity</a>, and have access to any of the magic in the game that isn't race-specific by adapting the type of terrain they're located at - a degree of adaptability that no other race in the game shares.
</li><li> The small press RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JAGSWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/JAGSWonderland">JAGS Wonderland</a></em> plays this for horror. Originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsOutToLunch">Wonderland</a> was expelled from the universe as we know it for being based on imagination and whimsy rather than physics and logic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The Caretakers</a> were perfectly fine with this, as they didn't wish to dirty their hands with that logic malarkey. And then humanity came along &mdash; creatures of logic that <em>could</em> imagine and dream &mdash; and the Caretakers decided, "Well, we can't have <em>that</em>..."
<ul><li> Consider that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">humans aren't just meant to inherit Creation, but that the terrifyingly-powerful Caretakers are nothing more than stepping-stones meant to facilitate Mankind's ultimate awakening. Humans are special because <em>Creation is literally intended for them.</em></span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a>, the collective desire of humans to tell stories is the primary driving force of Fate, a power that binds even the Gods themselves. It is also through this that the characters' power grows. The more a Scion is talked about, the more powerful they become.
</li><li> Humanity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> seems to have something special going for it, be it ungodly luck in their home planet Earth, extreme adaptability, or simply being the right species in the right place at the right time.

<ul><li> <em>Sacred Blood</em>, a religious play by Russian poetess Zinaida Gippius, is about a young mermaid who finds out that while all living creatures disappear after death, humans are different - they have immortal souls, given to them by God. Even before God appeared and gave them immortal souls, they were special because they were the only ones capable of love. Thus, God (who was human himself) could love them and spill his blood for them, making them even more special.

The entomorphs do like quite a bit about humans and Aquaans, but feel they ought to be wary of them anyway. No matter what any given human's psyche is, they're the dominant side of the relationship, whether they seek/desire it or not, just by having the more powerful technology. That power makes it functionally impossible for humans to do more than "let" the entomorphs determine their own affairs and keep sovereignty over the world of Tethys in general. After all, even pure benevolence is no perfect ward against the malignity that carelessness can bring...

While they may have had a head start technologically, they are amazed at how we're catching up since we can learn at a geometric rate.
</li><li> In an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bladebunny.com/comic/jin-prologue-page-3/">origin story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BladeBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BladeBunny">Blade Bunny</a></em>, yet another god has been slain by a human, so the sun and the moon decide to make their next child as weak as possible in the hope that he would grow up to be both a god and a hero and thus not get slain by a hero.

<ul><li> On the other hand Terragen (all sophonts descended from Old Earth) civilization is more technologically advanced, diverse, or numerous than every extant xenosophont race contacted, and quite a few extinct races.

So Terragens may be special within their own bubble of influence, at least until their expansion brings them into contact with other civilizations of similar scale - which <em>have</em> been detected, but are as yet too far away to contact, or for them to know about the Terragens' existence.

Gems are manufactured from non-living minerals using special machinery, with the new gems literally popping out of a hole in the ground for specific jobs and all the knowledge required for said job, such as a soldier or a servant.

Please note that a measure of bias is to be expected from the following entries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">having been written by humans and using a human perspective</a>.
<ul><li> The most obvious difference between humans and every other species on the planet is our sapience &mdash; but then, that hardly counts, since any intelligent aliens (which is what this trope is about) would have that too, by definition (and it's not like we can really <em>know</em> that other creatures don't have sapience too). Ditto opposable thumbs and toolmaking, agriculture, language, music, art, etc. in the vast majority of examples.
<ul><li> These two videos <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/robert_sapolsky_the_uniqueness_of_humans.html">1<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex.html">2<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> cover unique aspects of humans.
</li><li> Elephants and dolphins share many behaviours with us that may be signs of sapience, but without a way to effectively communicate with them, there's no way to positively confirm this. Elephants have been shown to mourn, and appear to have a concept of revenge and grudges (as unfortunate humans in areas where elephant-hunting is common have experienced firsthand). Dolphins not only recognise themselves, but <em>play</em> in the mirror like we do. They also have a very well-demonstrated capacity for evil.
</li></ul></li><li> One real physical advantage enjoyed by humanity is our endurance. We are relatively good at keeping a brisk pace over long periods of time. A prehistoric technique called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting">persistence hunting<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> takes advantage of this; it essentially entails following around an animal that you want to eat until it collapses from sheer exhaustion (then killing and eating it).
<ul><li> The only animals that can match us in this regard are wolves &mdash; even horses, which are commonly thought of as high-endurance animals due to their ability to travel at high speeds even while carrying heavy loads, can't match human endurance over a period of days rather than hours.
<ul><li> While only dogs and wolves can actually keep up with people over the course of days, even they have trouble and are vulnerable to overheating when it's hot and humid because they don't dissipate heat as efficiently (wolves evolved in a much colder climate than humans did) and must stop to cool down before humans have to. When it's cool enough for a dog or wolf to maintain about 3mph (human walking speed) without overheating they can keep up indefinitely.
</li><li> In general, it's not so much that humans are the most enduring per se in terms of muscle fatigue, but that, thanks to sweating, we have the best heat endurance. That's why African wild dogs normally hunt at night, when it's cooler. Panting isn't nearly as effective as sweating for keeping body temp down (whole body surface area evaporation vs just the mouth) and so most species will suffer heatstroke and "cook" until their organs fail if forced to keep going in heat. The disparity is greater in hot environments, of course, but anywhere if the pace is high enough body temp becomes an issue. The downside, though, is that it uses a lot of water.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Humans are also highly adaptable. We might not be the <em>best</em> at climbing, running, or swimming, but very few species can beat us in all three. And while we might not have the special advantages of creatures made to thrive in extreme heat or cold, we can tolerate a greater <em>range</em> of temperatures than most species can, which has probably contributed to the early spread of humanity across the whole planet.
<ul><li> And it's not just our ability to survive in a wider variety of temperatures, but that we can build and make things that let us live in more extreme climates. Humans can make all kinds of clothes for temperature regulation, and there are different types of houses for different types of conditions. Our use of electricity to heat and cool homes has certainly helped.
<ul><li> You don't need modern technology: humans colonized every continent (except Antarctica) and most major islands, with climates ranging from the arctic tundra to desert to jungle to mountain to plain to forest, equipped with nothing more sophisticated than rocks, sticks, and bones.
</li></ul></li><li> Related to this is our ability to change our careers multiple times in our lives. A human can be a farmer, then become a soldier, then become a scientist, then become an industrialist, then become a farmer again. To a sentient species with biologically defined castes, this kind of fluidity would be incomprehensible.
</li></ul></li><li> Another human trait is vindictiveness. Like all creatures, we don't like ourselves, our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">cubs</a>, our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentlyProtectiveGirlfriend">mates</a>, and our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry">lairs</a> to be disturbed by predators. And we have found that the best way to prevent that is simply to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalNemesis">hunt predators down</a> the way we do when we hunt for meat. Unfortunately "predators" often means other humans for we have not quite got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">Ape Shall Never Kill Ape</a> into our heads. Still this is a remarkably effective survival strategy as is noted by the rarity of creatures preying on humans. Parasites are of course an exception to this, but the fact that we have devoted an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">profession</a> to exterminating these is more evidence of this tendency.
<ul><li> On the flip side is the human ability to cut a deal, even with previously enemy species. Want to work towards a common goal? Awesome, welcome aboard, we'll do what we do best and you do what you do best and we'll all prosper. Want to start shit anyway? See above, re: vindictiveness. Compare the dogs, who made a deal, and the wolves, who didn't. Dogs thrive across the world in hundreds of variations and are treated as almost honorary humans. Wolves are struggling to avoid extinction and would probably have lost that struggle if the humans hadn't backed off.
</li></ul></li><li> Another uniquely human trait is our ability to throw things with a reasonable balance of distance, accuracy, and power. It often gets overlooked because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">it's so basic an ability to us</a> that we amuse ourselves by skipping rocks, shooting paper balls at garbage cans, or tossing balls at milk bottles in order to win large stuffed animals. And yet that simple ability is something that absolutely no other animal on the entire planet, including our closest relatives, can do, or ever did before our own ancestors. Just one of the many unique benefits of opposable thumbs and arms designed to throw things.
<ul><li> A 10 year old child can throw a baseball at about 40-50 mph. An athletic adult can throw a baseball somewhere in between 70mph to over 100mph. An adult chimpanzee can only throw something at around 20mph. Considering that kinetic energy increases with the square of velocity, a 10 year old child puts 4-7 times as much energy into a throw as a chimpanzee, and an adult puts 11-30 times as much energy into one.
</li><li> Humans (and our ancestors) have a styloid process on our third metacarpal (the bone in our palms that is between the base of our middle finger and our wrist). That is a bone extension that lets us lock our wrists in place and isn't present in any other extant species of great ape. This allows us to manipulate tools with greater strength and dexterity than would otherwise be possible.
</li></ul></li><li> In the cases where we can't escape from a predator using the environment or chase it off with thrown projectiles, our agility and range of motion can serve us very well in a fight. Very few animals can spin, bend, and twist their bodies in as many directions or as quickly as we can. We don't tend to think of humans as being particularly capable fighters compared to most animals, but bear in mind that modern humans are rarely in peak physical condition. In the wild, we might very well come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Humans actually have some of the densest muscles of any land mammal.</a> We just tend not to think of ourselves as being big scary predators because we don't have the claws, fangs, and thick fur. Case in point: an average sized man weighs 168-183 lbs which just happens to be very close to the weight of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">female Asian Black Bear</a> (148-198 lbs) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">male Jaguar</a> (124-211 lbs). The only land mammal carnivores that consistently outweigh adult men are lions, tigers, and different kinds of bears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">(oh my!)</a> Specifically: Polar bears, brown bears, and male black bears. Adult women, at about 130lbs on average, outweigh an adult grey wolf by about 30-50lbs.
</li><li> The difference in <em>arm</em> strength between a man and a great ape is misleading since most of the human muscle mass is in the back and legs. Great apes may have enough strength to rip an opponent's arms, yet they are poor walkers, unable to run on ground, unable to <em>punch</em> (their arms are evolved for gripping and tearing, and more than that, their fingers can't bend quite enough to ball into a fist) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">barely able to swim</a>.
</li><li> We've had tools and weapons so long that we've evolved to use them. Without a weapon, we're nearly helpless against anything big enough to consider us a meal. <em>With</em> a weapon, of almost any kind, we're death on rollerskates.
<ul><li> One variant of humanity, the Neanderthalers, had great muscular strength in the arms and hands. They also used fire, stone tools, made <em>glue</em> from tar, and were also apex hunters. The reason why they were absorbed into the modern variant of humanity is because they were so few in number compared to us.
</li><li> The oldest stone hand axes we find were made about 2.5 million years ago. The oldest fossils placed in the <em>Homo</em> genus are about that old too. This is not a coincidence. There is a reason why we're apex predators practically everywhere we wish to go and why everything short of another apex predator tends to leave us alone.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> We have unusually sharp senses on the whole. We have incredibly good eyesight for mammals (though not as good as many birds), above-average hearing, and a decent sense of smell (though we tend not to rely on it much compared to sight and sound). One of the reasons we tend not to consider this is that dogs &mdash; one of the species we interact most closely with &mdash; have better hearing <em>and</em> smell.
<ul><li> Our smell isn't great, but being descended from foraging omnivores (as opposed to grazers or predators) means we have a very good sense of taste, which can detect bio poisons (generally anything that we call "rotten" or "off-smelling") at very low levels. We're natural chemists.
<ul><li> It's theorized that our sense of taste evolved to ensure survival. Sweet tastes mean high density calories, salty tends to concentrate around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">salt</a> and certain necessary minerals, sour concentrates around vitamins necessary to ward off disease (especially Vitamin C), umami is well-cooked proteins, and bitter helps us avoid poisons.
</li></ul></li><li> Our vision is arguably better than that of a dog or wolf. We can't see anywhere near as well as either in low light, have a narrower field of vision, and don't sense movement as well; but dogs and wolves are basically red-green color blind and shortsighted, we are not. We also have better color vision and better binocular vision. We can distinguish between shades of color and estimate ranges in ways and at ranges dogs and wolves can not.
</li></ul></li><li> Another thing that makes humans special in real life is language. Sure, many animals can communicate in a limited way, but not a single other species has our capacity to recursively apply a limited set of communication cues to express absolutely everything imaginable. Even primates who get taught sign language never develop this capability to spontaneously make <em>more</em> language.
<ul><li> And another is our ability to learn from the past, namely by recording our ancestors' innovative achievements and building on them in turn. Apes and monkeys have a lot of similar advantages to humans, but in thousands of years, they're still using the same techniques to get fruit, bugs, etc. While in thousands of years we've gone from the invention of the wheel to space travel. It's called the Ratchet effect.
<ul><li> Recently monkeys and crows have been found to pass some traits down along the generations, but no species has come close to the sheer scale of human dedication to history.
</li><li> The key difference here is iteration - humans are capable not just of passing on knowledge, but on deliberately refining it. While other species have been observed to pass along learned techniques, none besides humans have been observed to deliberately examine and improve upon those techniques.
</li></ul></li><li> Our range of sounds is pretty unique as well, although some birds can match us in that field. Some substantially exceed us, like the lyrebird.
</li><li> With language comes our unsurpassed ability to work together. While some animals can act together, none come near the level of coordination and sheer numbers that humans can. Sure, a couple of lions are scary and dangerous, but even the weakest human tribe can easily bring dozens of combatants to the fight, operating as one through almost mind-reading communication and far-reaching planning capabilities. The only thing more dangerous than a group of humans is a larger group of humans.
<ul><li> Social insects are arguably better than humans at working together, and can make a good case for being even more ecologically dominant. Humans are aware of the importance of bees but tend to regard the even more dominant ants as mere pests, but social insects completely lack the combination of cooperation with iteration as described above, and as a result haven&#146;t changed the nature of their ecological impact for millions of years. So humans can just take them as part of the constant background and go on rearranging the rest of the world to suit us.
</li></ul></li><li> Communication is a huge survival benefit. As far as we know, all other animals on the planet have to personally encounter a novel threat in order to recognize it as a threat and/or deal with it. Humans can tell other humans how to prepare for and/or deal with a threat the second group has never personally experienced.
</li></ul></li><li> Probably as a side effect of verbal language, humans have better voluntary control over their respiratory reflexes than any other non-aquatic mammal. Being able to exhale steadily is necessary for speaking at length, and this, together with the fact we don't pant, means we can override the respiratory rhythms imposed by the medulla oblongata to a point of light-headedness: useful for swimmers or when exposed to smoke or other inhaled hazards.
</li><li> Humans have a better sense of rhythm than other species, which generally can't distinguish between a steady beat and an erratic one. Not only does this awareness provide a basis for numerous performing arts, but it's crucial for coordinating our actions when performing hands-on tasks (rowing, marching, harvesting, knitting, hammering) that require careful pacing.
</li><li> Although humans are not the only toolmaking species on the planet &mdash; chimpanzees have been seen twisting grass blades together to make a prong for retrieving maggots &mdash; we are, without question, the <em>best</em> toolmakers on the planet. No other species can hope to compete with communications satellites, nuclear missiles, and motor vehicles. One reason for this may be our desire to <em>teach</em> each other how to make things; chimps learn toolmaking by observing other chimps making tools, but they have no desire to deliberately impart their knowledge and skills to each other, and as a result there is enormous cultural loss from one generation to the next. In that regard, our greatest strength may be our ability to think <em>inside</em> the box.
<ul><li> In fact, modern humanity is even special in comparison to earlier humans in that we can <em>invent</em> new tools basically at will. Pre-humanity had been using stone axes for millions of years without substantial modifications to the basic design, which gives credence to certain theories that tool-using is actually at least partially instinctive in many species.
</li><li> Humans are extremely good at finding new uses for existing tools. Most of the basic tools one would find in a toolkit small enough to fit in a woman's purse can be used either as weapons or to make weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> Handedness is something humans express to the extreme when compared to other mammals. Processing visual details and spacial clues to the degree we do in color requires immense amounts of brainpower when compared to hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Fine motor control and language also require a lot of brainpower (but not as much as vision). Humans have brains large enough to completely handle vision with one side of the brain while fine motor control and language are handled by the other side. Our brains are powerful enough that one side can do all three but, as anyone who has tried to write with their off hand will tell you, the end result is awkward and clumsy.
</li><li> There are only two living species of mammal that use bipedal walking as their primary form of locomotion: Humans and Ground Pangolins. Other species of Primate and Pangolin are capable of bipedal walking (as are almost all birds, which are descended from bipedal winged dinosaurs). Ground Pangolins have a tail which they use for balance while walking. Humans don't have a tail and must walk upright to maintain balance.
</li><li> Starting with our anscestors and passed down to modern humans, the ability to create and control fire is unique to us. With fire, we were able to keep warm and dry, better defend ourselves/threaten predators, operate at night, create materials (e.g. pottery and metals), and cook otherwise dangerous and toxic foods. In addition, gathering around fires may very well have improved our sense of community in settlements.
</li><li> If there are other sentient, intelligent organisms in the universe who have developed a data system similar to the internet, they probably have pages describing how they are special as well.
<ul><li> If they have human-like qualities, they probably have a claim to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> Humans are also unique for our potential for evil. No other animal, even ones known to be very aggressive and cruel to their prey and/or each other, can best the human race in subjects such as torture, systematic oppression, genocide, destruction of the environment and other species, racism, and slavery. "Special" doesn't always mean something positive.
<ul><li> And yet at the same time, Humans have a unique capacity for kindness and cooperation on a scale unmatched by any other species. Humanity is the only species in the history of the planet with the power to not only save other species from extinction but to bring them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, to check its own growth through intentional means, and work together to repair the damage done in the past.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the <em>most</em> unique trait about Humann is simply their ability to question themselves and the world around them. Asking where exactly they fall in terms of good vs. evil, coming with concepts <em>like</em> good and evil, contemplating why they are the way they are, why they exist in the first place, where they came from, what happens after they die and if they're truly as special as they think. The simple ability to imagine all this exists in no other known species. That alone is incredibly special.
