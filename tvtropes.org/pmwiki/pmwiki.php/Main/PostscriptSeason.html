</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> had an OVA which retconned the title mecha's original purpose of construction from "fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Zonder</a>" to "fighting the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a> villain we just came up with". It actually went a lot better than it sounds, largely owing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">sheer force of over-the-top-itude</a>. Definitely goes under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.
<ul><li> The TV series itself had a "postscript last couple of episodes." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> was finally, decisively and explosively defeated. Happily ever after, right? Unfortunately years before the series began <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a spore for a "New Machine Species" implanted itself in Mikoto's nervous system and took her over, leading to a new, powerful and nigh indestructible foe to give GGG a hard time.</span> While it reeked of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> (there was some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a>, but it was only apparent in hindsight), it somehow managed to wrap itself up nicely.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">GUNNM: Last Order</a></em> might be seen as that, because when road accident forced Yukito Kishiro to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">Wrap It Up</a>, he tacked a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEnding">Happy Ending</a> onto the series and left it for half a decade, until he returned to it in <em>Last Order</em>. However, as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a>" is <em>even longer</em> than the original series, and it completely disregarded said happy ending, it is more like a cross between the sequel, remake and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">Revival</a> now.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PurpleEyesInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PurpleEyesInTheDark">Purple Eyes in the Dark</a></em> almost ran into this, but Shinohara was given enough notice that more was expected to come out of the manga, so there is a rather decently smooth transition between the first and second half of the manga. Originally, she was planning on Purple Eyes to last six volumes and the sixth volume included the build-up and final battle between Rinko and Sonehara, with both falling over a cliff and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">presumed dead</a>, with Shinya raising Rinko's daughter Mai. The second half kicks off from the last part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">skipping</a> several years ahead and now focusing on an older Mai as the protagonist for the next six volumes. Though there is a bit of a lack of consistency between the first and second half, including the creation of a clan that wants to kill transforming humans, though they were absolutely absent in the first half.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: After Akira Toriyama decided to officially conclude the manga with the Majin Buu storyline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation">Toei Animation</a> (the producers of the anime version) did their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>.
<ul><li> The Dark Dragon story arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> was itself a post-script season. Originally, the show was intended to last only through the Baby storyline, but Bandai asked Toei to kept the show going afterward in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">help promote</a> their <em>Dragon Ball Final Bout</em> fighting game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>.
</li><li> Eventually the series was continued again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">ignoring GT entirely</a>, initially with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">original</a> movies and then with a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> that adapted said movies first and then created original content.
</li><li> Depending on who you ask, any given arc of the original Dragon Ball manga could be considered this. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/intended-end/">Kazenshuu has a guide detailing the rumors<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but most fans will say at the very least that the Buu arc was the latest point in time for this to have happened, considering that arc started to actively <em>make fun</em> of the very tropes it had built its name on. The fact that many feel Toriyama ended the manga less through narrative conclusion and more personal weariness contributes to this outlook.
</li></ul></li><li> This was parodied with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/EvangelionAfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/EvangelionAfterTheEnd">Evangelion: After the End</a></em>, an official audio drama <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody">Self-Parody</a> released by the cast and crew of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. The plot involves the show unexpectedly being renewed for a second season (despite the ending making that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">unlikely</a>), and the cast subsequently struggling to come up with a decent way to continue the franchise. Among other things, they contemplate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retooling</a> it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a> program, a teen drama, and even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">reboot</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">IN SPACE</a>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> was meant to end with the Chapter Black saga, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">editors</a> had Yoshihiro Togashi make another arc, which was terribly contrived and rushed through in both the manga and its subsequent anime adaptation (especially the manga, where the final battle is barely even shown!)
</li><li> In many ways, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em> seemed to suffer from this in its final quarter, which featured a story that essentially had nothing but the most tangential connection to any of the plot that had come before it (the villains had obtained their main objective and were defeated three-quarters of the way through the show, leaving nothing for anyone to actually do). The frustrating thing, though, is that it's not strictly a postscript &mdash; the show was always intended to run to 52 episodes, and this final arc was simply filling out that requirement, even though the actual <em>story</em> of the series had been finished.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> (<em>Hokuto no Ken</em>):
<ul><li> The manga was renewed by <em>Jump</em> after completing its originally planned three-year run. Raoh, who was originally established to be Kenshiro's greatest adversary, was killed off as he literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended himself to the heavens</a>. Because of this, Buronson and Tetsuo Hara had to come up with not only new adversaries for Kenshiro to face, but also explain why they weren't around during the earlier stories, whether it was due to a peace treaty they had with Raoh (as what happened with Falco) or because they lived overseas across the world's only remaining ocean in the case of the entire Kingdom of Shura. The latter is particularly egregious, as it introduced not only another Hokuto martial art style (when the earlier stories established that Hokuto Shinken had no branches), but also gave Kenshiro, Raoh and Toki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth">secret siblings</a> that were never mentioned before (with Kaioh being practically Raoh's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackupTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackupTwin">Backup Twin</a>, as he was essentially made to serve his role as the ultimate antagonist).
</li><li> The post-Shura arcs are a more conventional example of a postscript season, as there are no more major martial arts factions after Kaioh is defeated and the manga becomes more around Kenshiro acting as a force of nature for the characters and situations surrounding him. It's for this reason that the anime series never adapted these later chapters.
</li></ul></li><li> It may not look like it, but the original plan for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> anime was to cover only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">the first generation games</a>, while giving sneak peaks to the Pok&eacute;mon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Gold and Silver</a></em>, which would launch shortly after the anime's end. This was because video game adaptations to other media <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameMoviesSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameMoviesSuck">have not had good track records</a>. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">things turned out a bit differently than what they planned for</a>.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WorldEventsProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WorldEventsProductions">World Events Productions</a> was first editing/dubbing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">Voltron</a></em>, the plan was to edit three short-lived, similar but unrelated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">Combining Mecha</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> shows (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoLion">GoLion</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DairuggerXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DairuggerXV">Dairugger XV</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Albegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Albegas">Albegas</a></em>) into one series for a combined total of 125 episodes to put into syndication. But with the unexpected popularity of Lion Voltron (<em>GoLion</em>) followed by the equally unexpected backlash against Vehicle Voltron (<em>Dairugger</em>), plans to dub <em>Albegas</em> were scrapped, leaving WEP 20 episodes short. So WEP actually hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation">Toei Animation</a> to animate 20 new Lion Voltron episodes that are not a part of <em>GoLion</em> at all.
</li><li> Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> featured Genki returning and reuniting with his friends, followed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> to try and prevent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Goldfish Poop Gang</a> from getting their hands on a disc capable of reviving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Moo.
</li><li> Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>. Ratings had been mediocre in Japan, so the anime was unable to get past the initial 52 episode order and had to quickly wrap up its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a> premise... and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">it became an absolute hit in the international market</a>, resulting in a somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> season that had barely anything to do with the rest of the series before it. A bit of an odd case in that this season has never actually aired in Japan, possibly due to the low ratings during its initial run. Notably, this is one of the few cases in which the general consensus is that the post script season is actually better that the seasons before it.
</li><li> Season 2 of <em>Yoroiden Samurai Troopers</em>, AKA <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RoninWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RoninWarriors">Ronin Warriors</a></em>. Originally everyone was supposed to die in the final sequence except Nasti and Jun ("Mia" and "Yuli"), but the producers were notified that the network wanted a second season... just when Episode 17 was about to air. They then stalled and rewrote the last two episodes to produce a happy ending &mdash; and introduce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> that became the central and driving force behind the next season. The second season, unlike many of these things, turned out to also be possibly better than the first.
</li><li> The final two (half-)seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> leave this impression. They were drawn ten years after the main series was complete in an attempt to revive it, feature antagonists that are nowhere as awesome and world-shattering as Fibrizzo and Dark Star, and, to boot, are new versions of old enemies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zanaffar and Rezo-Shabranigdo</span>.
</li><li> <em>Shining Heresy</em>, <em>Phantom Arc</em> and <em>Alone Again</em>, the sequel OVAs for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmoredTrooperVotoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmoredTrooperVotoms">Armored Trooper VOTOMS</a></em>.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em> ends with the crew successfully making it to Iscandar and back with the Cosmo Cleaner D in order to save the Earth from the Gamilas' radioactive pollution. About two years later, a new movie retelling the original story premiered followed by a sequel that many viewers were unhappy with. This lead to the creation of the second series, which was then followed by a TV movie, a third theatrical movie, and a third series. Then, two years after the third series ended, there was a fourth movie that seemed to retcon the events of the previous TV series.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em> originally ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joe making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span> in order to defeat Galactor once and for all, with there being no sequel apparently planned <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ol7k');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ol7k" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ol7k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although, planning notes for a sequel existed as early as 1976, showing that there was some interest in reviving the show</span>. Then four years later, a second series premiered in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joe is revealed to be alive and well, having been brought back as a cyborg.</span> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15bpo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15bpo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15bpo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which was a modification of earlier plans for the series where the actual Joe had died and an android copy was made to replace him, as well as the first 1976 plan where Galactor had modified him into a cyborg.</span>
</li><li> After the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> manga and its anime adaptation ended with most of the main characters graduating from high school, the manga was relaunched on two separate magazines, one strip following the graduated characters in college, and the other following the remaining characters still in high school. Both of these spinoffs were cancelled after one volume each.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em> ended up through this. It was originally 26 episodes, but the series proved <em>so</em> popular that they tacked on 20+ more. What makes this funny is that the episode following the supposed finale has both heroines and villains trying to figure out what to do since the series is still going before a few more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> are tossed about. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure">Smile Pretty Cure!</a></em> tried to invoke this, but all it did was piss off the viewers.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> TV series was meant to end on Episode 35, but it was extended by 12 episodes at the last minute. Since the Griffin arc was planned to be concluded in the <em>New Files</em> OVA, these final episodes did not follow on it and were instead a series of one-off stories sans the two-part finale. Unlike many other examples, this was not a bad thing, as <em>Patlabor</em> was already an episodic show to begin with, and the "new" finale is powerful in its own right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> was originally planned on being a trilogy, ending with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders</a></em>. However, said part, which introduced the iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit">stands</a> to the franchise, ended up being more popular than the manga's author, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirohikoAraki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirohikoAraki">Hirohiko Araki</a>, had intended and he decided to continue it from there. This led to the next part, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em>, feeling much more stand-alone in comparison to other parts, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo</a></em> was even <em>more</em> standalone<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2gxur');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2gxur" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2gxur');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the only returning cast members from part 4 are Jotaro and Koichi; moreover, its titular Jojo is related not only to just another Joestar (in this case, Jonathan from "Phantom Blood") but to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">DIO</a></span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean</a></em> averted this, since it was a distant sequel to <em>Stardust Crusaders</em>, and as for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureJojolion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureJojolion">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion</a></em>, they take place in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em> is essentially this trope, with Masashi Kishimoto repeatedly stating that he wanted to end <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> and have some time for himself. The series, however, had become a juggernaut of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a>, and Shueisha really wanted to keep the money coming in, despite <em>Naruto</em> ending with the biggest villain defeated and all loose ends tied up. <em>Boruto</em> wound up being a compromise in which a different author wrote and drew it with Kishimoto having a distant supervisory role and instead focuses on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">children of the main characters</a> and their unique conflicts and struggles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em> was supposed to be a one-off series, but it became so popular that four follow-up seasons were produced.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> was in one following issue #50 until at least the departure of writers Ken Penders and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlBollers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlBollers">Karl Bollers</a>. Depending on who you talk to, the multi-part "Endgame" was intended to end the book with the death of Dr. Robotnik, but was continued to go on due to it either being such a good money-maker or because it <em>wasn't</em> supposed to end there. Story and art quality following #50 is widely considered to be wildly mixed, as the series had to adapt new villains &mdash; including bringing Robotnik (well, an alternate universe version of him) back as Dr. Eggman, and was mandated by SEGA to do an adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>, which the comic managed to somewhat awkwardly squeeze in. Following the assignment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFlynn">Ian Flynn</a> as head writer, the comics were finally able to enter a new era and was able to shake the post-script status off, and went on pretty strong, even after a continuity reboot brought on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Penders' suit with Archie and SEGA</a>, until it was finally cancelled.
</li><li> The maxiseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmethystPrincessOfGemworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmethystPrincessOfGemworld">Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld</a></em> was originally going to be just a twelve-issue series. At the end of the series, the protagonist and her allies triumph, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is killed off, and the heroine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNowIMustGo">returns to her normal life on Earth</a> after peace is restored to the Gemworld. However, the series was so successful that DC Comics decided to do an ongoing series. The first twelve issues, done by the original creative team behind the maxi-series, weren't too bad. But when they left, the new creative team changed the direction of the series drastically, and did a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcons</a> designed to drag the series kicking and screaming into the mainstream DC universe and let's not get started when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">First Crisis</a> joins in. The series was cancelled soon afterward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> was only supposed to be eighteen issues, and after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alex was revealed as the mole and the Pride were all killed</span>, there wasn't really anywhere to go, but the series got a second volume with the original creative team that lasted another few years, and continued after they left, and was later relaunched again. Many fans liked the new characters and new directions (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VictorMancha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VictorMancha">Victor Mancha</a>), but the overall sense of suspense was lost, and, after the original creative team left, the quality dropped until the series was cancelled.
</li><li> Marvel's original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Micronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Micronauts">Micronauts</a></em> series concluded with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, but the heroes' Homeworld had been reduced to a lifeless ruin. With Homeworld in ruins and the war over, the Micronauts decide to go off and explore the Microverse as the series ended. Then the series was relaunched as <em>Micronauts: The New Voyages</em>. Under a new creative team, the series picked up where the original left off, but the series ended up being mostly dull and pointless as the Micronauts (and the story) wandered aimlessly. Eventually, they returned to Homeworld to restore it to life as the series ended.
</li><li> All of the character arcs and plot lines in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus</a></em> had been resolved by issue 200, yet Sim kept the series going for another 100 issues. The new issues were... not well-received.
</li><li> According to Herg&eacute;, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a></em> concluded with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinInTibet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinInTibet">Tintin In Tibet</a></em> and the works afterwards (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheCastafioreEmerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheCastafioreEmerald">The Castafiore Emerald</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinFlight714" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinFlight714">Flight 714</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinAndThePicaros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinAndThePicaros">Tintin and the Picaros</a></em> and the unfinished <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinAndAlphArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTintinAndAlphArt">Tintin and Alph Art</a></em>) were basically this. However, they actually were well received, and still continued the nature a little bit, showing that this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">not always a bad thing</a>.
</li><li> The main aim of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RogueTrooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RogueTrooper">Rogue Trooper</a></em> was to find the Traitor General responsible for the massacre of his comrades. Then he did. Unfortunately, as the character was one of <em>2000AD</em>'s most popular, cancellation was not an option. So he kept going as an intergalactic bounty hunter, then he was replaced with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> who had a Suspiciously Similar Mission to the original character, then there was a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> following a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> between both characters before they just decided to screw it and write a series of stories set <em>before</em> the original Rogue completed his original mission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a></em> is probably queen of this trope. It was originally meant to run for five issues before it got shunted aside for another series, but it proved popular enough to keep going. Then, they tried to cancel it at 30, but the vocal fanbase stopped it. Then, they tried to cancel it at about 80 and were stopped <em>again</em>. It was cancelled at 100, only to restart as <em>The Amazing Spider-Girl</em>, which lasted for 30 issues, then restarted as a brief app-exclusive series before finally concluding in one of the many <em>The End</em> titles. The character was then brought back in controversial fashion for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em> event in 2014/2015.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan">Superior Foes of Spider-Man</a></em> was slated to run for 12 issues, but the vocal fanbase got it extended to 17. By Nick Spencer's own account, this actually worked out for the best, as it allowed him to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayInTheLimelight">Day in the Limelight</a> stories for Beetle and Overdrive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/StarWarsPoeDameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/StarWarsPoeDameron">Star Wars: Poe Dameron</a></em> was supposed to end with issue #25, where it resolved its story arcs and led into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>. However, it was successful enough to continue with another six-part story, which served as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POVSequel">P.O.V. Sequel</a> to that movie and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em>.
</li><li> One of the big causes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman">Hawkman</a> is the fact that <em>Hawkworld</em> was just meant to be a mini series, detailing the post-crisis origin of the hawks (alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheManOfSteel">The Man of Steel</a> and several others). But great sales caused DC to extend it into an ongoing and make it take place in modern times, despite how already established canon would make that impossible.

Public outcry (and sheer profitability) lead Doyle first to write the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel">Interquel</a> novella <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em> and then to definitively resurrect the character in "The Empty House" for another 20 years of adventures. However, most of the iconic cases were written in the early era, and later stories often suffer from a lack of continuity.

</li><li> Anthony Horowitz intended to end the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider">Alex Rider</a></em> series with <em>Scorpia Rising</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> which ties up loose ends from earlier books, kills off a major character and ends with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation">Nebulous Evil Organisation</a> which serves as the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> being defeated once and for all. However, the series continued to grow in popularity for several years after the final book was released, and in order to be able to bring out some new material, the publishers decided to collect together several short stories set in the series' universe which had previously been published in newspapers, magazines and other sources in a new anthology. Horowitz decided to perform rewrites on a couple of the sketchier ones, and then to write a few new stories as well. Eventually he realised he missed writing the series so much, and that he still had lots of new ideas for it (one of the main reasons he'd decided to end the series when he did), that he decided to revive it completely and wrote a new book, <em>Never Say Die</em>, which goes to great lengths to reassert the status quo, most notably retconning in the survival of the character he'd killed off. There will be at least two more entries in the series now (in addition to the short story collection).

</li><li> The final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em>, which resolved the main premise of the show &mdash; the team is pardoned by the government, and works <em>for</em> them instead of hiding out in the L.A. underground. In turn, it also had a post-script finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> was originally plotted to a five-season arc. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PTEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PTEN">PTEN</a> syndication network crumbled around it and the show was not renewed for a fifth season, the fourth season storyline was reworked to complete the entire arc. The show was subsequently granted a fifth season, but with almost all of its major plot threads resolved. The fifth season that resulted was much weaker, and was composed of a lot of stories that had been cut from earlier seasons for various reasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a> </em> ended its third season with the destruction of the Liberator and the (apparent) death of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. When the fourth season opened, they had to take the show in a radically different direction to compensate for the changes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>, the high-school graduation season finale had changes like Mr. Feeny retiring and moving away, and Shawn deciding to take a job as a photographer instead of going to college. But when the series was renewed, both of these changes were reversed so that Shawn and Mr. Feeny could be part of the college experience along with Cory, Topanga, and the rest.
</li><li> The fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> ended with Buffy dying heroically to save Dawn and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden">by extension</a>, all reality; the episode even ended with a shot of her gravestone ("She saved the world. A lot."). It was picked up for two more seasons on a different channel. Even after the series was cancelled for good, it received a comic book continuation starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy: Season 8</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> was this due to being on the bubble throughout its seventh season. Brad Kern has said that production was game for an eighth season, but they had no idea whether or not they'd be renewed. (They actually didn't get renewed until a week before the season finale aired&mdash;meaning, unlike prior seasons, production completed on an air of uncertainty.) So, the writers tried to provide an episode that would allow for closure (the title mirroring the first episode, references to Prue and other departed characters and concepts, Daryl's conflict of loyalties reaching a head, and the destruction of the Nexus), but also leave the door open for continuing (the Charmed Ones being thought dead by everyone and changing their faces). Of course, the eventual eighth season was heavily panned for recycled ideas, a hated new character, budget cuts (which led to Leo having a minimized role and Daryl being outright dropped), and a lack of direction, but its last episode ended up being widely praised.
</li><li> The fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> has the cast end up failing their goals and back in Greendale.
</li><li> The ultimate example is probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>, which has essentially been on a series of postscript seasons since <em>1960</em>. It was originally intended to be 13 episodes long, with Coronation Street bulldozed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a>. However, it proved so popular that a new series was commissioned, and it's been broadcasting more or less continuously to the present day.
</li><li> The seventh season of the Canadian coroner drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaVincisInquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaVincisInquest">Da Vinci's Inquest</a></em> ended with most of the major plot threads tied up (including the arrest of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, who was prevalent throughout the last three seasons) and most of the characters getting a decent send-off. Although the series ended with a vague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> (in which the main character, Dominic Da Vinci, announces his intent to run for Mayor of Vancouver), it was the end... until the show was retooled a year later as <em>Da Vinci's City Hall</em>, skipping the entire process of the mayoral election and going straight to Da Vinci in office. Although the postscript season still integrated a handful of characters from the previous seasons, the show bled viewers and was subsequently cancelled at the end of its season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series went on hiatus twice: first, an 18-month break between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinBaker">Colin Baker</a>'s two seasons, and again after it was canceled in 1989. It's the first hiatus that fits this best &mdash; while Colin's second season didn't have any loose ends to tie up, the series was in a precarious situation with the BBC, and had been given a major cut in length, going from 13 45-minute episodes to 14 25-minute episodes. Since the show was effectively on trial, it's unsurprising they decided to incorporate it into the plot, having the framing story for the season be about the Doctor on trial, and giving it the overall name "The Trial of a Time Lord". As it turned out, ratings were lower than before the hiatus, but the BBC decided to renew the series for another year.
</li><li> The next season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy">Sylvester McCoy</a>'s first, also had to deal with this. Producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnNathanTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnNathanTurner">John Nathan-Turner</a> had been expecting to move onto another series, only to be told by his bosses that he would be staying on <em>Who</em>, and found he basically had to plan the next season from scratch with limited time to prepare, including finding a new Doctor (the BBC refused to let Colin have another season, and Colin was unwilling to do only a regeneration story, as it would make it difficult to find work) and a new script editor, the previous one having left when his contract ended. On top of that, it was scheduled against popular British soap opera <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>, treated as a sacrificial lamb. The series managed to hang on by the skin of its teeth, and got another two seasons before the next, and much longer, hiatus.
</li><li> For the new series, a variant is the 2009 Specials (also known as "series 4b" by fans). The Tenth Doctor's last season ended with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E13JourneysEnd">Journey's End</a>", a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> involving all of the Tenth Doctor's companions and with the fate of <em>reality itself</em> at stake, with an ending that resolved most of the Tenth Doctor's major running plot arcs. The following year, rather than a full season, the Tenth Doctor had a miniseries of mostly self-contained specials that dealt with consequences of previous adventures, ending with the Tenth Doctor regenerating into the Eleventh. Though the show wasn't in danger of cancellation, apparently the miniseries was put in place to give the production team room to breathe during major behind-the-scenes shifts, notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> handing over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Showrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Showrunner">showrunner</a>.
</li><li> A more straightforward example is Series 10 of the revived program - not for the show as a whole, but for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>'s era as showrunner. Series 9 was intended as his last, tying up loose plots from his era (e.g. what happened to the Zygons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Gallifrey</span> after "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho50thASTheDayOfTheDoctor">The Day of the Doctor</a>") and ending with an epic 3-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> (featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E11HeavenSent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E11HeavenSent">his own most acclaimed script</a>) that removed Clara Oswald from the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and from the Doctor's memories</span>, leaving behind a clean slate. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2015CSTheHusbandsOfRiverSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2015CSTheHusbandsOfRiverSong">post-series Christmas Special</a> then gave a happy ending to the Doctor, serving as another perfectly acceptable conclusion to his era. But, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall">Chris Chibnall</a> having to finish up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Broadchurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Broadchurch">Broadchurch</a></em> before taking over, Moffat had to keep going for one more series. With a new companion and a premiere entitled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E1ThePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E1ThePilot">The Pilot</a>", this was clearly something of a retool.

Thus, the finale was slightly re-written and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2017CSTwiceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2017CSTwiceUponATime">Twice Upon A Time</a>" was created, doing a bit of extra wrapping up, providing some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a> to the Capaldi and Moffat eras, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">showing the Doctor's regeneration</a>, passing the torch at last over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisChibnall">Chris Chibnall</a> as showrunner and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieWhittaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieWhittaker">Jodie Whittaker</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">as the Doctor.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em> neatly resolved its entire premise in the penultimate season, wiping out the entire species responsible for the action of the plot. As a result, an entirely new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe">random alien race</a> had to be introduced to keep the plot afloat.
</li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastboundAndDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastboundAndDown">Eastbound &amp; Down</a></em> ended with Kenny Powers faking his death in order to spend all his time with his family. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a> insisted on a fourth season, Kenny ended up resurfacing in public, even having to go to jail for tax fraud.
</li><li> The Season 6 finale for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em> was specifically written to be the series finale, shaking up the status quo by sending Sherlock and Joan to London. But then the network ordered the <em>true</em> final season, Season 7, rendering the Season 6 finale as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">Series Fauxnale</a>.
</li><li> The episode order for the fourth and last season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Felicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Felicity">Felicity</a></em> was increased after production had wrapped. The original finale resolved the existing storylines and gave a brief synopsis of the characters' lives for the next two years. The extra episodes, rather than simply being written to take place and be aired before the finale, instead created a new five-episode arc set after the two year fast-forward, in which Felicity magically travels back in time to the beginning of the season in order to make different choices. The show had never included fantasy elements before, and the whole arc, while interesting, felt undeniably tacked on to an otherwise finished product.
</li><li> Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlightOfTheConchords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlightOfTheConchords">Flight of the Conchords</a></em>. The band hadn't really expected the show to get a second season, and production took much longer than expected since they'd already blown through most of their material during Season 1. This is likely why Season 2 ends with the band being deported back to New Zealand, thus providing a definite conclusion this time.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em>, the third, fourth and fifth season finales were written as respectable farewells in case the show didn't get another season. There's even a joke in the one where Will decides to stay in Philadelphia, when NBC executives literally kidnap him and haul him back to Bel-Air in the back of a van.
</li><li> Every season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights">Friday Night Lights</a></em> after the third season, although this is a rare case of a postscript season done right. The main narrative arc concludes with the Panthers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing at State despite a big comeback when everyone expected them to be eliminated early</span>, as well as most of the main characters' arcs being wrapped up... that is, until the fourth and fifth seasons, where Coach Taylor (who was forced out of his job) is hired at a newly-reopened school and teaches a new team with lesser equipment, budget and facilities, training them from scratch. However, the narrative (coupled with cameos and updates on the characters who were previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">put on a bus</a>) made it just as well-written as the previous seasons.
</li><li> John Esmonde and Bob Larbey's (now little remembered) National Service sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSomeIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSomeIn">Get Some In!</a></em> was cancelled after its fourth season in 1977. Esmonde and Larbey decided to end on a high note, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Corporal Marsh</a> demoted to Aircraftman for cheating on a nursing exam and posted to a remote RAF base in Labrador, while "erks" Jakey, Ken, Matthew, and Bruce received a cushy posting to an RAF hospital in Malta. However, the <em>News of the World</em> successfully campaigned ITV to renew the series (citing audience figures of over 14 million), and the fifth season premiere in 1978 saw the plot developments at the end of the fourth season reversed as the "erks" were immediately recalled to Britain and found themselves once again under the heel of Marsh (who had returned a supposed hero and restored to Corporal). The cast and audience alike were unhappy with the result, doubly so because Robert Lindsay, who played Jakey Smith, had accepted the title role in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">John Sullivan</a>-penned sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CitizenSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CitizenSmith">Citizen Smith</a></em> during the hiatus and was replaced by future <em>Brush Strokes</em> star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">Karl Howman</a>. The fifth season proved to be the last, and ended on a much less final note than the fourth season.
</li><li> Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow">After Show</a>, this happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeaArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeaArthur">Bea Arthur</a> decided to leave the show after the seventh season, and the series ends with Dorothy getting married and moving to Atlanta. However, her mother Sophia decides to stay in Miami with the roommates, setting up the premise for said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterShow">After Show</a>, <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoldenPalace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoldenPalace">Golden Palace</a></em>, as the girls buy a struggling high-end hotel. It wasn't well received, but has gained something of a cult following in subsequent years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> features a variant of this. The original plan was to make the show an anthology series, with the first season's group of heroes story ending with the battle at Kirby Plaza, and then being replaced with an entirely new cast each season. However, the ratings for S1 were so successful, and the show became such a hot property, that the finale was hastily changed to end with a cliffhanger where Hiro time-travels to feudal Japan. The following season wasn't planned, and began a precipitous slide in both quality and ratings that ended with the show's cancellation at the end of its fourth season.
</li><li> Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderWizard">Kamen Rider Wizard</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> franchise started having Post-Script Episodes that usually serve as a symbolic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">torch-passing</a> by having the current protagonist and his successor meet and deal with some small crisis.
<ul><li> <em>Wizard</em> had a two-parter that served as an anniversary special (since it ended with the 15th anniversary of the Heisei-era shows); this included both an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> by Gaim and the return of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a> star Masahiro Inoue as a plot where Haruto is pulled into a realm where the Riders' defeated enemies reside and plan on returning to Earth.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive">Kamen Rider Drive</a></em> played it straight, with a plot focusing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost">Kamen Rider Ghost</a> and an unknown party trying to steal an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Eyecon</a>; protagonist Shinnosuke does get some special focus, mostly on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">returning to mundane police duty without the Drive powers</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderGhost">Kamen Rider Ghost</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid">Kamen Rider Ex-Aid</a></em> avert this, simply having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early Bird Cameos</a> from a character from the incoming show. <em>Ghost</em> does it a little oddly since rather than Ex-Aid himself, the villainous "Black Ex-Aid" shows up and gives Specter and Necrom a good thrashing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita">La Femme Nikita</a></em>. Despite being the USA Network's top rated drama during its 4th season (even with no advertisement by the network), the cancellation was announced. After the large fan campaign to bring the series back, in September 2000 a truncated 5th season was announced. It did help out with some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> they had left behind, but gave one hell of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>.

It lasted another season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> ended its seventh season by resolving its entire premise, so the eighth season (on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy">new network</a>) had to begin with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, the shifting of the setting five hundred years into the future, and the introduction of a new antagonist. It survived for three more seasons, mostly because the plot of the series was never much more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> for the slapstick and snark. The creators had to reset the series <em>again</em> when 11th and 12th seasons were Kickstarted. An update of the premise &mdash; descendants of the original Mads are subjecting a new protagonist to the "experiment" &mdash; answered some but not all questions. (Most notably, how Tom Servo and Crow were roped in again is never explained.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">The Mads themselves noted</a> that it would have been easier to reboot the whole thing instead of sticking to established continuity.

Oh, crap! <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> devoted <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_with_the_Cast_of_Night_Court">an episode<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to the idea that several of the characters on that show were unhappy with the Season 9 ending to <em>Night Court</em>, so they staged a "fake" episode, reuniting several of the actual cast members (Harry Anderson, Markie Post, and Charles Robinson), and they had Harry and Christine get married.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> had a wonderful plot conclusion at the end of Season 6, with all the plot threads closed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rumplestitskin/Mr Gold prefering his family over his Dark One powers, Regina finally being recognized and loved as Queen/Mayor, Mary Margaret and David finally living together in a farm, Emma and Hook happily married and raising Henry with Regina, everybody resuming their normal lives and dining at Granny's every night</span> but opening a new story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Henry's daughter looking for an adult Henry who doesn't remember anything about Storybrooke</span>. Thus we got Season 7, which turned out to be the show's last season and as a consequence has very little connection to anything that came before it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses">Only Fools and Horses</a></em>: The British sitcom about two poor wheeler-dealer street-market trader brothers ended after 15 years (7 seasons and four sets of Christmas specials) with the Trotter brothers finding an antique watch in their garage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">and becoming millionaires at last</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em> has had shaky ratings from the start. According to co-creator and producer Mike Schur, every season finale after season 2 (with possibly the exception of season 5) has been a potential series finale. As such, every season has been a postscript season. Season 7 might be the most obvious example, since season 6 ends with a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> taking place 3 years later.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> has had this happen a handful of times.
<ul><li> After years of declining ratings, Fox decided to pull the plug on the show after announcement of the sixth season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em>. As such, the writers decided to send the show out with a bang and do all the things they had wanted to do in the previous five years, including cameos from previous Rangers, tying up loose ends involving recurring characters, and culminating in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> with the Rangers and many of their allies going up against every villain from the previous seasons, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to purge the universe of evil. However, ratings for "In Space" picked up significantly mid-way through the season, resulting in Fox renewing it for another season. That next season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em> has a handful of characters returning, but otherwise marks an awkward transition between the continuity heavy first six seasons of "the Zordon Era" and the standalone (but still in continuity) stories that followed in following seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> was to be the final season, as Disney had decided to shelf the entire series, partly because they didn't know what to do with it and partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">they were actually kind of embarrassed to have it.</a> However, when Saban bought the series back, they decided to continue with a new Sentai adaptation, forcing a final decision on whether RPM's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> plot would be canon. (It is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">sort of...</a>) The post-script seasons here don't have as much of an effect as other examples, as each season has been a standalone story since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown">Murphy Brown</a></em> was revived for an eleventh season in 2018, seeing the title character coming out of retirement to confront the modern-day media landscape of cable news, social media, presidents with volatile personalities, and her son Avery becoming a host on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNews">Fox News</a> expy. The majority of the original cast returned for the revival (which only lasted a single season), although Avery was recast as an adult, and Phil's bar is now run by his daughter since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">Pat Corley died</a>.

Halfway through season 6, Big A is revealed, and all of the Liars' torture until this point is explained. There are no loose ends left to be tied up. The second half of season 6 starts 5 years later, with a new A, and it goes on for one and a half seasons, making for a plot that was on par with the rest of the series, but nevertheless felt a little bit disconnected to the rest of the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Primeval">Primeval</a></em>, due to its huge budget, by British television standards, has spent most of its runtime on the verge of being cancelled. On top of that the actor playing the lead hero wanted out during season 3. This season, while containing some big fat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hooks</a>, killed off not only him but also the main villain (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wife</span>). While the gimmick driving the series was still there the writers had to develop a completely new storyline when they were eventually greenlit for a season 4 and 5. (Season 5 ended on a similar note, if the series gets revived again there will be another post script season.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em> was an odd case of unplanned seasons. While the creators mentioned the show was only designed for two seasons, Fox squeezed a third season out of them in 2007-2008. This unfolded the same year when... you guessed it... the writer's strike happened. As a result, the third season was truncated to 13 episodes, and forced the writers to produce a fourth season to wrap up the show. Depending on who you ask, the fourth year was either a creative resurgence from the mediocre third season or a godawful train wreck of epic proportions. The controversial series ending was even more polarizing. And let's not even get into the cash grabbing DVD movie, The Final Break. Despite the series allegedly ending for good, a <em>fifth</em> season is set to premiere in 2017.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele">Remington Steele</a></em> married off Laura and Steele, as the show's cancellation looked certain <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> had been offered the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a>. However, <em>because</em> Brosnan got the Bond role, NBC decided to renew the show, bringing it back for a very lame half-season which lacked all of the charm of the preceding seasons <em>and</em> effectively scuttling Brosnan's big movie break. Brosnan didn't end up playing Bond for some years.
</li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> neared the end of its eighth season, which had been expected to be its last, the ratings improved enough for the network to ask for one more season, in which the show completely lost its moorings as the Conners' lottery win allowed the writers to indulge in all the "what-if" plotlines they had never otherwise dared to touch.
</li><li> Sort of happened on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em>. The show had finished taping its finale (which centered around the characters' high school graduation) when NBC ordered more episodes. Which shouldn't have been a problem, as the finale hadn't aired yet, and they could simply air the new episodes prior to the finale&mdash;except that the actors' contracts had expired, and everyone but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffaniThiessen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffaniThiessen">Tiffani Thiessen</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBerkley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBerkley">Elizabeth Berkley</a> decided to sign new ones. As a result, Kelly and Jessie were replaced with a new character named Tori Scott. No explanation was given for Kelly and Jessie's absence in the new episodes, and since the finale was already in the can, no explanation could be given for Tori's absence at graduation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> had a lot of stays of execution:
<ul><li> The sixth season built up to wrapping up the various plot-lines: Elliott was getting married to Keith, who brought out the best in her; Turk and Carla had a lovely family set up with their baby daughter, Izzy, and the same was true of Dr Cox and Jordan with their kids, Jack and Jennifer Dylan; JD was as neurotic as ever, but mostly unchanged and dealing with the alienation that his unlikeable habits led to; Laverne had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> ... and at the last minute, they got renewed for season seven. Suddenly, JD finds out that Kim lied to him about her miscarriage, Elliott's dysfunctions with Keith got turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, and instead of the (admittedly kind of depressing) ending that things had been shaping up for, we got a cliffhanger season ending and a season premiere that really only served to once again point out that JD and Elliott were the endgame couple.
</li><li> Season 7 would have been the last season if it weren't for the 2007-2008 writers' strike.
</li><li> The show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> which wrapped up every main characters' arc occurred at the end of its eighth season. It was then picked up for a ninth where it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">retooled</a> to focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">a completely different group of characters</a> in a setting only tangentially related to Sacred Heart.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV">seaQuest DSV</a></em> also had this happen twice. It was not known if the show would be renewed, so at the end of the first season, they destroyed the SeaQuest. The show was picked up, so there was a retool and a new SeaQuest was constructed. Then at the end of the second season, facing a similar situation, the SeaQuest was transported to another planet and <em>then</em> destroyed. The show was picked up, so it was renamed <em>SeaQuest 2032</em> and moved ten years into the future. Partway into season three, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> had a grand series finale at the end of the 10th season. They got all the original cast back, had a big almost-wedding, and every married Camden child was expecting twins. Then, like the Jesus that the Christian characters never mentioned, the show was revived three days later because the executives mistook the finale's high ratings as a sign that people wanted the show to continue. For the 11th season, the writers were forced to find a way out of the corner they backed themselves into with the twins, as well as deal with a much smaller budget. Their way out of these problems was to make Lucy have a miscarriage over the summer, have the longest-running (and highest paid) actors not appear in every episode, bring in a bevy of cheaper teen actors, and have Reverend Camden homeschool the twins to save money on a classroom set and extras. The results were dismal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em> nuked its town in the first season finale, not expecting renewal. With the renewal, the second season was set "five years earlier", with all ongoing plotlines continuing uninterrupted. It worked because it was a comedy show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> had this happen multiple times, with seasons 6, 7, 8 and 9. The show was expected to be cancelled after five seasons, and so ended on a decent (but not Grand) finale ("Revelations") &mdash; the expectation was that they would then move on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> (to be called "Stargate: The Lost City" or something similar) which would segue into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, which was very different in concept at this stage). Then the show was renewed for a sixth season, and so was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> ("Full Circle") which introduced the planned concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>. Then the show was renewed for a seventh season, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> was cancelled and its concept was rewritten as a season-long arc that would finish with a two-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> ("Lost City") which would segue into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> instead. Then the series was renewed for an eighth season, so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>'s ending was changed to make more of a cliffhanger to be resolved in the Season 8 premiere, and <em>Stargate Atlantis</em> started running concurrently to <em>Stargate SG-1</em>. It was expected that the eighth season would be the last, however, so the end of the season was once again devised to close the book on the series: both major galactic threats were taken away in a three-episode arc ("Reckoning" Parts 1 and 2 and "Threads" &mdash; interestingly, these came just <em>before</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>), and then the series ended with yet another two-part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> ("Moebius") involving time-traveling to ancient Egypt. The show was then picked up <em>again</em> for a ninth season, and was given a retool which replaced several cast members and introduced a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Season 9 was made knowing that the show would be renewed for at least another year &mdash; and then, finally, the show was cancelled after the end of Season 10. Whether the final episode ("Unending") was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> is doubtful; the real resolution of the series happened in the DVD movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArkOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArkOfTruth">The Ark of Truth</a></em>. And then there was another DVD movie, and more planned... until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateUniverse">Stargate Universe</a></em> underperformed. Ooops.
</li><li> After an unprecedented (at the time) letter-writing campaign saved <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> from cancellation, fans were "rewarded" with a third season containing many of the show's weakest and/or goofiest episodes (even by the standards of the series), including the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E1SpocksBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E1SpocksBrain">Spock's Brain</a></em> as season premiere. Since the series was always purely episodic, the usual reasons for a lackluster Post Script Season don't apply; what really killed the show was that the network promised a solid Tuesday night slot and then was moved to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridayNightDeathSlot">Friday... er, Saturday Night Death Slot</a>, violating a verbal contract with creator/producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>. He left the show in protest and had little involvement in the third season. That said, some strong episodes did churn out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> germinated as a post-script season for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>. You could easily swap the roles around &mdash; Troi for Kes, Worf for Tuvok, Riker for Chakotay &mdash; and not lose anything in the transfer, especially during Seasons 1 and 2.
</li><li> Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sam making the ultimate sacrifice to put Lucifer back in his cage and Dean giving up his demon hunting ways and settling down.</span> It was a very touching episode and would have made the perfect series finale... and then they got another season. The show's creator left the showrunner seat, with his co-producer picking up the slack for seasons six and seven (the change of hands was even marked by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWorldEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealWorldEpisode">Real World Episode</a> where the show's creator dies</span>). After she left, a new showrunner claimed to have a three-season plan which would end the series at 10 seasons... but it <em>just kept going</em>. Said showrunner stayed on for an additional season, with two new ones coming in to carry the series to its <em>fifteenth</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaleSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaleSeason">final season</a>.
</li><li> The seventh season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em> was clearly supposed to be the series finale: first, Red FINALLY caught the guys smoking pot in his basement. Then he finally said to his son he loved him without insulting him in the process. And, of course, at the end of this episode, the main character Eric <strong>left the series</strong>. Aside from an open ending of the Kelso-Jackie-Hyde love triangle storyline, there was nothing more to add to the story. The open ending was clearly tacked on after it was known the series was renewed. Jackie and Hyde's relationship had already had its ups and downs, and they were resolved... only to be thrown more obstacles at the tail end to provide material for new episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> pulled this twice:
<ul><li> The seventh season ended with a large number of plot threads being resolved (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tony Almeida confronting, and Renee Walker presumably killing, the mastermind behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> of the last four seasons</span>) and bringing things full circle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kim Bauer</span> returning to save Jack from a weaponized virus via a transplant. There was lots of uncertainty for a time, but the show was unexpectedly renewed and brought back for another year. In response, the producers moved the show all the way to the other side of the country (New York), introduced an entirely new cast of characters, reworked a previously-good supporting character into the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and indicated that the previous mastermind, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alan Wilson</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">got off scot-free for his crimes</a>.
</li><li> Ratings for season 8 suffered and the show was not renewed as a result. However, the last stretch of episodes were highly praised for shaking up the series' status quo dramatically (and ended with Jack on the run and President Taylor disgraced and forced to resign from office over her role in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Russian treaty</span>). A year-and-a-half later, it was announced that the show would return in a limited series called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourLiveAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourLiveAnotherDay">24: Live Another Day</a></em>. Three years later, another limited series called <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFourLegacy">Twenty Four Legacy</a></em> (which doesn't feature Jack Bauer or any other returning characters, except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tony</span>) began in February.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> suffered from this after Laura Palmer's killer was revealed, the main plot being resolved (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, no less - the writers had other plans, and did <em>not</em> want to answer the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingQuestion">Driving Question</a> less than halfway through the second season). It felt incredibly awkward to have Dale Cooper still hanging around in Twin Peaks, even though he didn't have a reason to stay after the killer had been found, and it resulted in a flimsy "Cooper is investigated for stealing drugs" plotline to keep him from leaving, while the other characters went spiraling off into several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedByMountainLions">Trapped by Mountain Lions</a> plots (most egregiously, James, who gets framed for murder while he's out of town by two new characters <em>completely</em> unconnected to anyone else). Windom Earle at least managed to pull everyone's plotlines back together into something more cohesive, but was no BOB.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> faced retool after retool as they tried to wring a few more seasons out after the first movie. The sixth and seventh seasons are particularly guilty of premature closure. They "explained" the conspiracy arc, killed off nearly all the Syndicate antagonists, and perhaps most significantly, resolved the long-running mystery of Mulder's missing sister.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">In a sense</a>, the entire <em>Final Fantasy</em> series could qualify. Creator Hironobu Sakaguchi didn't expect to remain in the game industry for long after a floundering a bit with his earlier works, so he decided that his "final game" would be a "fantasy RPG", hence <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy</a></em>. However, the game was so successful that it saved the company and spawned an entire franchise. Sakaguchi would direct all the subsequent mainline installments until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">V</a></em> and then act as series' producer until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">IX</a></em> (albeit, a very "hands off" producing role according to some interviews, as he was more focused on his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin">movie</a></em> during and after the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">VII</a></em>). Interesting, though, in that each installment generally stands alone with its own characters, plot, and setting, due to Sakaguchi's own distaste for sequels (hence why none of the games had direct sequels prior to his departure from Square). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3wlp8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3wlp8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3wlp8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While a fun excuse for the "Final" in the name this story is an apocryphal urban legend.</span>
</li><li> After years of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games existing as standalone games, the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> and the intrigue created by a promotional video expanding on the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> led to production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em> scant months after the game's Japanese release.

Finally, it also addressed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>, leading to many outcries from people that had assumed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tidus died, despite the ending of <em>X</em> showing him returning to Spira and <em>X-2</em> using that <em>exact</em> scene to show his return</span>.

But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that fan demand for a sequel was high, so they made one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Said sequel</a> follows the main heroine's little sister and a new character with the original party members having gone missing or playing supporting roles, features a new antagonist never even hinted at in the first game, and features a storyline almost entirely detached from the original, focusing on time travel and undoing paradoxes in the timeline. After THAT game came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">another game</a>, this time focusing entirely on Lightning and wrapping up the series for good.

Three years later the developers began releasing new stories for the original game in order to renew interest in the series. The new stories continued existing plots from the original games and were of considerably higher difficulty. <em>Eye of the North</em> can also be considered as such.

The missions themselves are fairly middle-of-the-road&mdash; not as good as the best of the game's DLC packs, not as bad as the worst&mdash; but the ability to continue exploring the wasteland post-ending is a worthwhile addition.

The problem? The game became a smash hit in Japan and surprisingly, it got a huge reception overseas as well. This soon prompted Capcom to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">a new game for the series</a> but Takumi, whose story with the original characters was closed in the third game, wanted to create a whole new story with brand new characters. Capcom thought the game would become a failure if it didn't have the original protagonist so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">they forced his inclusion in the game</a>. The result? A game that can stand as its own story, but at the same time, suffers from the lack of connectivity to the older games. Takumi also intended to end the series with that game but, once again, Capcom pushed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">a new game</a>. This time though, Takumi stepped out and left the series' future to another team, although he would continue to work on more AA games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsAceAttorney">Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaiGyakutenSaiban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaiGyakutenSaiban">Dai Gyakuten Saiban</a></em>.

The season finale is designed as a series finale; Luanne and Lucky are married, virtually every character from the regulars to one-shot guest stars appear as wedding guests, and the episode even ends with Hank and the gang drinking in the alley. Then Fox decided (largely due to fan outcry) to renew it at the last moment, and <em>King of the Hill</em> lasted two more seasons before its final cancellation.

The beginning of the 20th season found them back where they were before. Also, Mr. Haney had to be written out, because his voice actor had died.

After good reruns on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> got a new season in development (after about 4 years), the decision was made to structure the fourth season into four part episode arcs that could be strung together as a movie. This left the Daemon arc, hugely hyped by the fanbase, as being resolved in just four episodes and not an entire season. It hurt too that the third set of episodes was never produced, leaving the second set of episodes on a big cliffhanger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> danced with this for the better part of its run.

When season 3 came along, it did a fair job of setting up a new status quo: the Decepticons regroup on the planet Char and still pose a threat, but the primary villains were now the Quintessons, a diabolical race of slavers who were introduced as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">One-Scene Wonder</a> in <em>The Movie</em>.
</li><li> Season 3 ended with Optimus Prime coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, saving the galaxy, and finally managing to establish peace between the Autobots and Decepticons. Story over, right? Naturally, there was a <em>very</em> brief (three whole episodes!) season 4, which immediately undid season 3's finale for the sake of having the Autobots and Decepticons fight again.
</li><li> Then there were the anime Transformers series, The Headmasters, Masterforce and Victory, which ignored Season 4, and undid the finale again.
</li><li> Incredibly, there was then a <em>season 5</em> made up of live-action segments in which a horrifying animatronic Optimus tells a young boy stories about the war, which consist entirely of footage from previous seasons and <em>The Movie</em>.

</li><li> Then the show got rebranded as <em>Transformers: Generation 2</em> and broadcast for two more seasons...which, much like season 5, were just episodes from the first four seasons edited together with new CGI sequences.

Then the show was re-upped for season 4, though the order was done early enough that said episode was able to be rewritten to act as the first part of a three-part story.

The fifth season is an anthology series depicting several one-off or multi-part adventures, most of which just serve to tie up some loose ends unrelated to the main arc. The only arc that has any real relation to the main story arc is the <em>opening</em> arc about Kavaxas. Some of the arcs (particularly the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> themed arc) have even been categorized by most of the show's writing staff and the network itself as "non-canon".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies">Bubble Guppies</a></em> initially ended after its fourth season, but due to an extreme fanbase and popularity, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> three years later.
</li><li> Though it was treated as an epilogue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries">Mini Series</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em> was ordered and produced as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">the original show</a>'s sixth and final season, after Sugar had already planned to wrap up the storyline in season five. Cartoon Network gave the crew both a movie and another season though, so they decided to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> for both, with <em>Future</em> taking place after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> and focusing on the personal problems an older teen Steven developed due to growing up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Living Emotional Crutch</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7jstd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7jstd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7jstd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Also, the network order was for twenty-six more episodes. Six of those episodes were used to extend the fifth season.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> had tied most of its loose ends by its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFauxnale">initial series finale</a>, but its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Uncancelled">Uncancellation</a> was helped by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a> conclusion to Fry and Leela's romance which allowed for continued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> over the four TV movies. The two Comedy Central seasons taking place after the movies have few, if any, serialized elements.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016">Ben 10 (2016)</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> concluding Season 4 which introduced Azmuth and had Ben facing off against Vilgax was produced as the Grand Finale, similar to how the original series ended. However, the network ordered an additional three 1-hour specials constituting a "Season 5" afterward.
