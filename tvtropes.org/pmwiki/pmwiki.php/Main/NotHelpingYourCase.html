Flat denials may have worked, since they were so unbelievable. Boasting likely would have worked, given Torako's class is in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DustbinSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DustbinSchool">Dustbin School</a> full of delinquents. Embarrassed efforts to explain and downplay them ("I heard you knocked down a building barehanded!" "I-it was old! And structurally unsound!")? Did not work. It only earned Torako annoyance and ire until it became clear she really was as strong as rumors suggested.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri">Digimon Adventure tri.</a></em>: With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> against Digimon running rampant, Mimi, determined to prove to the world that not all Digimon are bad, impulsively jumps into a fight with a rampaging Ogremon alone in front of the press. Unfortunately, Togemon ends up shooting down a news helicopter during the battle, which naturally only makes the public's opinion of Digimon even worse.
</li><li> The Uchiha Clan's downfall in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> was mostly due to a big case of this. After Kurama's rampage at the beginning of the series there were suspicions that the Uchihas were responsible for it (and as it turned out, it was an Uchiha behind it, albeit one believed long dead). When it became clear that nobody in Konoha trusted the Uchihas, rather than proving them wrong, they plan to stage a coup to take over the village by force. Naturally, this ensured that the higher-ups would have the groundwork to order Itachi to kill them off, since their reaction pretty much screamed "guilty" all over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom">My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!</a></em>, a group of girls accuses Catarina of being a bully and provides a rather sizeable list of misdeeds as "evidence". Her friends speak up in her defense...by saying that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">too dense</a> to have carried out the complicated plots they're accusing her of committing. Catarina, who's standing right there, doesn't get offended because she's <em>too dense</em> to realize she's being insulted (her unspoken reaction is "I'm so happy they're standing up for me, but something seems off here...").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>: During the Egg Moon saga, Sonic goes about destroying Eggman's Sunshine Balls, which he's using to provide the populace with artificial sunlight after his Egg Moon supposedly malfunctioned and created a permanent eclipse, and ends up making himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a> in the process. While it turns out he was right to do so (Eggman was in fact deliberately controlling the Egg Moon to keep blocking the sun in order to sell the Sunshine Balls as part of a get-rich-quick scheme and to make himself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>), he still doesn't bother telling anyone this before he starts smashing the towers, and only does so after he gets tired of fighting the combined forces of Knuckles and G.U.N., something Knuckles calls him out on; Sonic simply retorts that he thought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">it was obvious</a>.

He does this with <em>more</em> murder.

Harry bristles and shows the Minister the "I must not tell lies" scar that he received from his various detentions with Umbridge.
</li><li> Harry Potter himself and other characters of the cast will fall into the wrong side of this trope from time to time. Take for instance <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em> where he is accused of being the Heir of Slytherin, the fact he is caught being near several crime scenes and is heard speaking the snake-tongue Parcelmouth really doesn't help despite the fact he was trying to do good.
</li><li> Snape can hardly do <em>anything</em> without looking as suspicious and unlikable as he can; he practically goes out of his way to make the heroes suspect he's a bad guy in nearly every book. He's also quite resentful of the fact that anyone would suspect that he, a former Death Eater, might be a Death Eater. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This turns out to be part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero-Approval Gambit</a>, allowing him to function as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> within Voldemort's inner circle.</span>
</li><li> In a meta-sense, Slytherin House is the go-to house for villains and jerks, breeding Death Eaters like nobody's business. The first Slytherin character to not be a colossal asshat is Horace Slughorn, who isn't ambitious for himself but instead sets up connections between students with strong potential (blatantly favoring them and ignoring others). In the seventh year, not one Slytherin is part of the resistance against the Death Eaters in the school, with only later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> clarifying that some of the later reinforcements were Slytherins. It takes until <em>Cursed Child</em> for 100% heroic Slytherins to show up (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Malfoy and Harry's sons</span>).
</li><li> The textbook <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> mentions that Uric the Oddball subjected himself to three months of Fwooper song so he could prove that it did not cause insanity. He then showed up to the next Wizards' Council meeting naked save for a dead badger on his head, thus convincing nobody. One could also make the case that voluntarily pulling a stunt like that calls the results into question on account of the fact you'd have to have a pretty tenuous grasp on sanity to think it was a good idea in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tyrion Lannister does this a lot, and is strange in that he <em>works it to his advantage</em>. As an example, when he assumed a position of authority in a city where everyone hated him and assumed he was a monster because of his unfortunate appearance, he used this as an excuse to bring along an entourage composed of vicious mountain barbarians who carry human body parts as trophies. This assisted immensely with his political goals.
</li><li> In the third book, he's accused of murdering his nephew, unfairly imprisoned, and given a sham trial; and all this is happening shortly after he fought in an incredibly vicious battle during which he received a horrible injury from which he is still recovering. He snaps, and no one could blame him. And he <em>still</em> manages to work this to a minor advantage; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> convinced he's getting a sham trial, he demands trial by combat. He selects a member of the Martells as his representative; the Martells deeply hate the Lannisters and are longtime rivals of their recent political allies the Tyrells. If he wins the trial, the Tyrells will be pissed that the alleged murderer of their daughter's fiance got away (And, although Tyrion doesn't know it, wary that Tywin might find out they actually killed Joffrey); if he loses the trial, the Martells will be pissed that their son died for him. It's one final "screw you" to his family.</span>
</li><li> In general, Jaime and Tyrion Lannister tend to use this trope in a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">Then Let Me Be Evil</a>" kind of way. They're constrained by bigotry (Tyrion) or unfair judgments (Jaime) and are unable to escape them despite their best efforts, so they tend to stop giving their "best" efforts and instead use an evil reputation to get their way.
</li><li> One of the many things that Jaime and Tyrion Lannister share is a total and crippling inability to keep their big mouths shut when a clever remark occurs to them, no matter how many weapons are pointed at their heads at the time, or how testy the people holding them are. That tendency does more to nearly get them killed over the course of the series than all the Stark soldiers combined.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein's Monster</a>. Seriously, there's a bit in the book where a kid insists that the monster is an ogre who wants to kill him. The monster denies this and then kills the kid for not listening. The monster is trying to abduct him at the time, so that would be an extra dose of <em>really</em> not helping his case.
</li><li> Bryony theorises that this is why Veil turned to thievery and delinquency in <em>Outcast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> because she's one of the only three Abbeydwellers who don't immediately accuse him whenever something goes missing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> has quite a variety of these, on a sliding scale from "didn't do something mildly embarrassing" to "not a mass-murdering monster".
<ul><li> Perhaps the most explicit is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Galina Casban</span> is mouthing off to her captors about all the horrible retribution they'll face when she's freed, unaware that she's making herself look extra guilty of the murder she's been framed for. Bonus: she is a conniving evil murderer, but didn't commit that <em>particular</em> crime.
</li><li> And then there are all the instances where someone's not helping their case about <em>true</em> accusations. Everything from yelling "I'M NOT ANGRY" to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shouting about how you're not mad... to the voice in your head</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Seventh Sword</em> trilogy, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveDuncan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveDuncan">Dave Duncan</a>, our hero, Shonsu, is a great swordsman who doesn't know the customs of the land he lives in. He often talks too much, which turns out to not help his case. At the end of the first book, Shonsu is asked about how he managed to survive an attack. He goes into detail about how he used a dagger and attacked two men at one time, then attacked a fleeing swordsman, chopping him down as he ran away. All of these actions were against the well-established rules of the land.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a>: The Doomsday Ship</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Dash Rendar</a> is accused of being the ship's saboteur.

Though when he risks his life to seal a compartment and stop decompression, people relax a little more. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He'd been there in the first place to steal the ship, but got beaten to the punch.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz</a></em>, Dorothy's pet Eureka (in later books the Pink Kitten) is on trial for eating one of the Wizard's pet miniature pigs. She refuses to defend herself other than to point out how much she's wanted and tried to eat said pigs. <em>Nobody</em> wants her convicted, but nobody can believe she's innocent by this point. A representative excerpt from the trial (the Tin Woodsman is defending her):
<div class="indent"><strong>Tin Woodsman:</strong> Look at the kitten&#146;s intelligent eyes; (here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily) gaze at her smiling countenance! (here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth) mark the tender pose of her soft, padded little hands! (Here Eureka bared her sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage.)

<ul><li> Thomas Cromwell is intent on erasing his disreputable past as a brawler and soldier and giving himself and his family a respectable position in the world, often disturbed by the notion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">he looks like a man who could easily kill someone</a>. But Cromwell also uses his shadowy reputation and physically imposing presence whenever it would advance his agenda, and it advances his agenda often.
</li><li> Cromwell is appalled when Wriothesley suggests that Cromwell used Anne Boleyn's trial as a means of revenge for Cardinal Wolsey's death and wonders if he might one day go after Henry himself. Cromwell is genuinely loyal to Henry (if irritated whenever the subject comes up because Henry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">acts like he had nothing to do with it</a>) but since he <em>did</em> use Anne's downfall to get revenge, it's not a wholly unreasonable line of thought.

</li><li> Then <em>The Lost Age</em> reveals that without the power of Alchemy the world will decay to nothing... and in comes the Mars Clan's second set of champions, led by a brute who openly believes Prox will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> and who will do everything in his power to make that happen, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">double-crossing Felix &amp; Co.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousDemotivator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousDemotivator">who are working for him to save the world</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife">and their parents</a>).

The fandom continues to dispute whether or not this is true<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0h20w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0h20w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0h20w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">On the one hand he had repeatedly tried to convince the king not to be on the front line for this very reason and the tactical situation really had gone to hell; on the other he had numerous personal and political reasons to prevent the king's survival, and even at the most pessimistic view of the situation his withdrawal made the difference between a defeat and a massacre.</span>. However, two of the prisoners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInTheDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInTheDungeon">Locked in the Dungeon</a> and tortured in his close ally's estate are a soldier who survived Ostagar and the friend of another (missing, likely dead) survivor who claimed Loghain retreated while there was still hope for the king. This revelation works against him at the Landsmeet, especially since the latter was a member of the nobility. Even if he <em>didn't</em> betray Cailan, suppression of the witnesses tends to suggest otherwise (his cover story was that the Wardens betrayed the king by leading him into a hopeless charge, which is definitely a lie). Which leads to even more fandom dispute as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">whether Loghain knew what his ally was doing in that regard</a>...

After the armor flew all the way across town and affixed itself to Launchpad in the middle of his denial, it kind of spoiled it. (Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on your point of view - people realized he wasn't Gizmoduck after he wrecked half the city in a vain attempt to control the suit.)

Firstly: they allow <em>Lex FREAKING Luthor</em> to have control over them for most of the series, meaning everyone is confident they're being played like puppets in Lex's feud against Superman. Two: they seem more interested in <em>goading</em> the League into going off the rails, with incidents like sending agents to the Watchtower to steal an alien superweapon that the Legion impounded than in legitimately opposing them should they genuinely go rogue.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHead">Machine Head</a> released the standalone single "Do or Die" in October of 2019, which was almost instantly criticized for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader">lyrics</a>, and the general opinion was that it was petty and immature and made Robb Flynn look incredibly thin-skinned and unable to accept that people sometimes say unflattering things and have strong negative opinions about polarizing releases (which <em>Catharsis</em>, their 2018 full-length, absolutely was). Flynn, not content to release the song and then let it be, then took to Instagram several days later to call out the people who called him out over the song, where he posted yet <em>another</em> angry rant that included several homophobic and misogynistic insults and made even the fans who didn't turn against "Do or Die" hold their heads. He also repeatedly took shots at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dope">Dope</a> (as comparisons between the choruses to "Do or Die" and Dope's own "Die MF Die" had been made), who proceeded to make Flynn look like <em>even more</em> of an idiot when frontman Edsel Dope publicly responded to Flynn in a manner that was, all things considered, extremely gracious and tactful, as he stated that he was a fan of Machine Head and respected Flynn's musical career, politely stated that he had absolutely no idea what his problem with him or Dope was, and proceeded to pull up Dope and Machine Head's streaming stats (as Flynn had openly called Dope nobodies) to show that Dope actually had <em>more</em> streaming listeners. The end result was that Flynn looked like even more of a raging manchild who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism">couldn't handle any sort of negative fan or critical reception</a>, while the band he attempted to start a fight with (clearly hoping for an ugly public spat) put him in his place without a single unkind word.
</li><li> In 2019, the Christian rapper Flame filed a lawsuit against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatyPerry">Katy Perry</a> and her label Warner Bros. Music, claiming that the song "Dark Horse" ripped off a background melody from his own song "Joyful Noise". Flame went on to win the lawsuit. In response, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTuber</a> musician Adam Neely posted a video defending Katy Perry, showing off the melody in question and arguing that the melody "ripped off" was fairly basic and common to a lot of songs, making the lawsuit dangerous precedent. Warner Music responded to Neely's video by filing a manual copyright claim against it, citing that he was infringing on their rights to "Dark Horse"...by playing a melody <em>they had lost the rights to</em>. The kicker? The segment they claimed was copyright infringing was him playing the melody as heard in "Joyful Noise". <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6X2MEl7R8">Neely's follow-up video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was mainly him being completely bewildered by all this.
