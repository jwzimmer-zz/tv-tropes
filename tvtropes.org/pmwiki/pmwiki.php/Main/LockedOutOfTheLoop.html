<ul><li> Flycatcher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em> is constantly searching for a way to return to the Homelands to find his wife and children. Everyone else in the Fabletown office knows, from his ramblings whenever he's drunk (which he forgets completely afterwards) that his wife and children were tortured, his wife and daughters in fact raped in front of him, and killed when his kingdom was invaded, but they let him believe they're still alive for his peace of mind. There's some evidence that magic is being used to keep his memories suppressed.
<ul><li> Beast had assumed that Flycatcher was sentenced to this work as some bizarre punishment and lets him out of it. Beauty tells him off for how without the job, Flycatcher can remember the truth
</li><li> Eventually, Flycatcher regained his memories, and was seen afterwards having something of a breakdown and lashing out at Santa Claus, who restored them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">he got better</a>.</span>
</li><li> Only the higher-ups of Fabletown know that under her exterior of a flighty shoe-loving rich girl, Cinderella is the greatest secret agent on the planet. It comes up when the new council meets to discuss things and Belle keeps asking why Cinderella is there as "she only own a shoe store!"
</li></ul></li><li> Early on, Zoot the shrew was so nearsighted that he didn't realize he was sharing the margins of <em>Cricket</em> magazine with insects and other invertebrates. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Everybuggy</a> else carefully nurtured his belief that he was hanging out with moles, rabbits and other small mammals, because shrews normally eat bugs. (Zoot later got some glasses and learned the truth, fortunately <em>after</em> he became a vegetarian.)
</li><li> Kup of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW">The Transformers (IDW)</a></em> was once marooned on a planet with radioactive crystals. The crystals caused him to view other Autobots as vicious zombies, leading him to brutally slaughter several rescue parties. He was ultimately saved, but had to be constantly be fed modified doses of the crystals to keep the hallucinations at bay. Everyone aware of what happened was sworn to secrecy to avoid burdening the ancient bot with guilt of having killed his own comrades.
</li><li> Knuckles' Guardian lineage, the number of echidnas still around and his family in general in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, at least pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide">Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Collide</a></em>. Up until Robotnik's Ultimate Annihilator went off, Knuckles thought he was the last of his kind, save for the power-mad Enerjak. Then, the Dark Legion came knocking. Then Echidnaopolis showed up, with his mother there still alive. Within a year, Knuckles would also find out about the Guardians and their purpose and that his dad was alive.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s schtick, especially during the period between the late 1990's to the mid 2000's, to the point where things would blow up spectacularly because he never bothered to tell people things at all. Some of the worst case scenarios include his backup plans against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica">Justice League</a> (they were meant to be secret and he didn't want anyone to know... until Ra's al Ghul got them), his gang-controlling plan (He purposely locked Stephanie Brown out from it because he adamantly distrusted her) and not outright telling the Bat-Family that he might have let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> know that he might know their identities (how was he supposed to know he'd figure it out?)
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>. Will chose to keep Elyon in the dark about her and the others' double lives as Guardians and her true identity as the princess of Meridian... which bites them in the ass when Cedric and Phobos <em>do</em> tell her the truth and use it to manipulate Elyon into joining their side. Cornelia gives Will <em>quite</em> a bit of flak over it.
</li><li> Lampshaded by the mainstream Spider-Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGeddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGeddon">Spider-Geddon</a></em>. Having spent his portion of the event in one of his titles being manhandled by Morlun, he doesn't show up in the main storyline until the last half of the final issue, long after both Miles Morales and the Superior Spider-Man have it well in hand. He immediately complains that you miss the beginning and you end up totally lost.

<ul><li> <em>Everywhere</em>. Those who don't Remember are completely out of the loop, and even those that do are not spared. Thanks to the varying times of death, a lot of people who do Remember are still missing a lot of important information. Only those who made it to the Second Long Night have any real idea of what's going on. Take, for example, the Starks. Ned Stark is completely out of the loop even though he Remembers, thanks to his early death; the big explanation at the beginning is mainly for his benefit. His wife and eldest son, Robb, hardly fare any better, since they died at the Red Wedding. Rickon, the last Stark to die in the previous timeline prior to the Long Night, is the only one who takes things relatively well, thanks to his young age and late death (he died at the Battle of the Bastards).
</li><li> The Crownlands (particularly King's Landing, <em>especially</em> the Red Keep) and the Stormlands are this, mostly because of Robert Baratheon. Thanks to his hatred of Targaryens, everyone knows that the moment he finds out about the kingdoms pledging themselves to House Targaryen once again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> will erupt. Thus, they are deliberately limiting communication so they can gather as many kingdoms as possible under the Targaryen banner to discourage a major conflict. As a result, Robert is literally the last major political figure in Westeros to find out about <em>Jon</em> Targaryen, as everyone with the knowledge fled from King's Landing; even Dorne and the Martells found out before he did, while in the middle of their own wide-scale civil war no less. Even then, he only found out due to one of Hoster's bannermen betraying him, and even that information is incomplete, so he doesn't find out that Jon Targaryen was originally known as Jon <em>Snow</em> until much later from an Iron Bank envoy (the Bank having found out via Daenerys).
</li><li> On a much smaller scale, Tommen was completely unaware that Jaime was his real father up to his death, having still believed that Ned and Stannis's claims were all vicious lies. He did <em>not</em> take it well when he found out the truth. This is an especially bad case, because after his death in the first timeline, <em>everyone</em> knew about Cersei and Jaime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">Twincest</a>; after Cersei usurped the Irone Throne, it went from being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a> to Jaime becoming Cersei's public consort in all but name, with them not even bothering to try and hide it anymore. This, of course, translated with the Remembering &mdash; everyone now knows Cersei's children aren't Robert's, to the point that one of Tyrion's first decrees was to legitimize Myrcella and Tommen as Lannisters. Ironically, this led to Tommen hating Jaime and refusing the legitimization out of spite.

Cap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">lampshades</a> this and points out that there's more going on than what Stark told him. Unfortunately, Spidey tells Cap that Stark told him Cap would say that and doesn't listen to him.
</li><li> A very tragic example would be when Helmut Zemo played a surveillance footage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of a brainwashed Bucky murdering Tony's parents</span>, Tony angrily demanded Steve if he knew this. Steve confirmed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he knew that his parents were killed by HYDRA but he himself didn't know that it was Bucky who did it</span>.

<ul><li> It's essentially an open secret that Joseph Gribble is the product of his mother Nancy having an affair with John Redcorn. The only people not aware are Joseph himself and his "father" Dale. The episode revealing this showed that Peggy Hill didn't know either, but Hank never told her because he figured it was so blatantly obvious he didn't have to say anything. Nobody tells them because it would destroy the Gribble family. Notably, later on in the series Dale comes to the conclusion that aliens impregnated Nancy...with his own sperm, in order to produce a race of super-warriors. Hank decides to let him believe this. In another episode Dale tells Hank that Bill's girlfriend's daughter shares DNA with his son...and just as Hank thinks he's figured out the truth, Dale concludes that the girl is <em>also</em> his artificially-inseminated child. Other episodes present it as being a case of Dale simply being in deep denial (and a fan theory has it that Dale knew all along but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">acted clueless about it</a> so he could torment Redcorn by bonding with Joseph and subtly rubbing it in his face).

This has been happening on a more general basis in US Pakistan relations, for the simple reason that things the US told them kept getting leaked. The recent revelation that elements of the Pakistani intelligence service were actively helping Osama bin Laden to hide in Pakistan only highlights why this type of thing is sometimes done.
</li><li> Intelligence agencies that normally cooperate (such as the American and British agencies) will start keeping things closer to their chests if they think their ally has a mole or a leak.
</li><li> In politics, aides, advisors, and operatives often take actions without telling their boss&mdash; precisely so that if the situation does blow up in their faces, they can (truthfully) claim that they'd acted alone and their boss didn't know. This is called "plausible deniability". (The word is often misused to refer to a politician who <em>did</em> know but pretends not to.)
<ul><li> Can also lead to politicians not monitoring certain of their aides, advisors, and operatives too closely so that if they <em>are</em> doing anything improper and keeping it from them, they won't accidentally find out.
</li></ul></li><li> One can easily argue every wartime American President has done it, but Richard Nixon was especially notorious for this kind of activity. Under the smoke and mirrors of withdrawing 150,000 American troops from the frontlines during the Vietnam War, Nixon secretly expanded the conflict into neighboring Cambodia. Not just the government of Vietnam; but Congress and the Supreme Court were unaware and/or lied to about the invasion for at least <em>FOUR YEARS</em> until the full truth was revealed (and some information is still classified to this day). Nixon knowingly suppressed knowledge and ruined the career of several officers questioning the legality of it, because the overall action was a severe abuse of Presidential authority. The only reason Nixon wasn't impeached for the affair? The Watergate trials were also occurring and he was already being impeached for that. It was a major contributing factor for Nixon's resignation, given that even if he survived Watergate, there was another case of underhanded activity Congress could (and would) throw at him.
</li><li> The United States Vice Presidency was considered an unimportant office for most of its existence, and the VP was often not privy to secret government projects or information of what the government was up to. This kind of bit the US government in the rear when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarrySTruman">Harry S Truman</a> succeeded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> as president when the latter died&mdash;right at the tail end of World War II. He didn't even know the US <em>had</em> a nuclear bomb project.
<ul><li> Speaking of Vice Presidents, immediately after the JFK assassination, security agents surrounded Lyndon Johnson and rushed him to a secret room in the hospital, fearing that someone might attempt to kill him too. The effect of this was that virtually every member of the presidential staff in Dallas knew that JFK was dead, and thus that Johnson was now President, before Johnson himself did.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the entire concept of Need To Know access. It's not enough that you have the clearance to access classified information, if it's not necessary to know it to perform your duties, you don't get to look at it.
<ul><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">Plausible Deniability</a>. An intelligence agency carries out the intentions of their government but without explaining the fine detail of what they're up to (espionage is illegal, after all), so if something goes wrong the government can truthfully claim they didn't know about it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic abusers</a> can do this, telling their victims something but selectively omitting critical details, leading the victim to screw up and "justify" the resultant abuse. Example: A man calls his wife and leaves a message to tell her they'll be going out for dinner that evening. Based upon their past history, she understands that this means they will be going to a casual dining restaurant, and dresses appropriately. What the husband failed to mention was that this dinner is at a very up-scale establishment, and it is with a very important person who is expected to significantly impact the husband's career. He comes home from work to pick up his wife, with no time to spare, only to find that she is grossly underdressed for the occasion. Abuse follows, in which he berates her and accuses her of intentionally trying to sabotage his career, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">brushes off her legitimate defense as a lame excuse and an attempt to fix the blame on him</a>.
