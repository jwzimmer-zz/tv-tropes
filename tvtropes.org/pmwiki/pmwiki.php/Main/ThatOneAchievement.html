It's particularly jarring to players when most of them were easy, or at least fairly easy, to obtain.

Of course, there are those who are apathetic about it, but they are unlikely to be hunting for these in the first place.

And then, of course, there's the "Get All Other Achievements" achievement, which naturally falls into this if one or more other achievements are hard to get.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne3">Max Payne 3</a></em> has the achievement "The Shadows Rushed Me", which requires you to unlock and complete New York Minute Hardcore mode. Sound easy? Wrong. The whole game must be completed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">while timed</a>, in one sitting, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">dying or otherwise failing sends you straight back to Chapter 1</a>.
</li><li> "Saint" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em> requires you to save fifty survivors. There are about fifty-three in the game. Even if you get an ending where Frank and Isabella are counted as survivors, your window of acceptable loss is <em>really</em> thin. This is made slightly easier by giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">the otherwise heavily incompetent AI</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">shotguns to defend themselves with</a>, as they manage to actually fight back against the zombies with them.
<ul><li> Nearly as difficult as "Saint" is "7 Day Survivor", where the game requires you survive for seven game days in Infinity mode. This is incredibly difficult because: one game day is 2 hours. Your health drains every 1 minute and forty seconds. There are limited health items, no saving (not even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">Save-Game Limits</a>), no continues, 14 hours all in one shot. To make matters worse, since you couldn't save this meant running your X-Box that entire time. In the early days of the 360, this ran a very real chance of giving you the Red Ring of Death. This game was released just near the end of the original one-year warranty for launch day consoles. Have fun.
<ul><li> The Xbox One version makes it a little easier, since the machine&#146;s software allows you to pick up from the exact same spot you left your game at if you don&#146;t start another game or app. However, this means that until you get the achievement, you literally can&#146;t do anything else with your device.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also "Outdoorsman", which requires you to spend 24 consecutive hours outside. It's not difficult at all, but it forces you to stay in Leisure Park for two real-time hours. There's no healing, and going anywhere else resets the timer, forcing you to do it again from the start. The only thing that makes it boring as opposed to difficult is that there's a roof that you can easily jump on and wait out the time.
</li><li> "Off The Record" has the "Alpha Vs Omega" achievement. To get it you have to have Denyce, the very first survivor you encounter, attack and damage Sgt Boykin, one the last psychopaths in the game. It basically turns the entire playthrough into one long god-awful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> that forces you to reload every time she dies. This can lead to HOURS of lost storyline progress because you weren't able to get to a bathroom or wasted your last healing item on her. Of course, this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a>, even if you do manage this incredibly frustrating feat all you get is a measly 20 point achievement. Hope the agony of putting up with her for all that time was worth it, though you can at least watch Boykin rip her apart once the achievement pops up.
<ul><li> However, in spite of that, it sounds like a fairy easy (if lengthy) achievement if you just hole up somewhere safe and wait, right? Well, you need to complete the <em>entire plot to fight this psychopath</em>. This means you need to enter the safehouse (but also keep Denyce far enough away to avoid bringing her in with you) regularly, and you need to escort her through the cases that the game gives you. And, since you're advancing the story, more dangerous enemies will begin appearing, and appear more often.
</li><li> One particular plot necessary fight, the fight against TK&#146;s Helicopter, takes place on a rooftop with a loading screen. After the fight, Frank (and anyone with him) is teleported directly to the Safe House. Not only can Denyse not come up to the fight, meaning the fight is now on a strict time limit, but as soon as the cutscene in the Safe House is over, Frank has to race back to the Hotel before she dies. And since the game autosaves after every case is completed, if Denyse doesn&#146;t have enough health after the fight and you can&#146;t make it in time, you&#146;ll have to start all over.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "Nice Shootin&#146;, Tex!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame">Ghostbusters: The Video Game</a></em>. You have to complete the game with less than $100,000 in property damage. To give a better perspective of how difficult this achievement is, the second level of the game is in Times Square. Hit a police car with your beam, that's $35,000. Hit a bus? <strong>$80,000.</strong>
<ul><li> Thanks to Atari shutting down the servers for the PC and PS3 versions, the 10 online achievements/trophies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">unobtainable</a> in those versions.
</li></ul></li><li> When players started complaining that "Insane" difficulty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm">Alien Swarm</a></em> was too easy, the developers added "Brutal," a difficulty level so hard even <em>they</em> couldn't beat it. They also added two achievements&mdash;one for beating a level in Brutal with friendly fire damage set to max, and one for beating the entire campaign in Brutal. As of this writing, they've respectively been earned by 0.9% and 0.6% of players on Steam. (The least-earned achievement, at 0.3%, is for killing 100,000 aliens, but that's not a matter of difficulty so much as grinding.)
<ul><li> High Voltage Expert. You have to get 250 kills with a Tesla Cannon - a weapon designed purely for support. It's not hard or anything, but grinding this one out is going to take a <em>lot</em> of time.
</li></ul></li><li> Matador in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnslavedOdysseyToTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnslavedOdysseyToTheWest">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a></em>, which requires you to defeat a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">Bullfight Boss</a> without once getting hit by its charge attack. Two things qualify it; one, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> which you cannot defeat until a set amount of time has passed, and two, unlike most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">Bullfight Bosses</a>, this one actually can course correct.
<ul><li> Also, Tech Curator. Tech orbs are these glowing red orbs that you use to upgrade your equipment. They are literally everywhere. So it isn't difficult to get 70%-90% of these without really trying. For Tech Curator, you need to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> on these. Many of them are scattered across large areas, behind objects, hidden in the scenery, etcetera. Combines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Last Lousy Point</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> in every possible way. Oh, and there are some in chase sections. Good Hunting!
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPlanet2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostPlanet2">Lost Planet 2</a></em>'s "Committed 'Til The End" achievement takes the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon">Ghost Recon</a></em> example below and goes one step further. You not only have to achieve all the "Good Job" awards in every level (across six chapters, with some truly insane feats required), but you have to collect 500 titles (some of which include co-op achievements), level yourself to level 99 with <em>six</em> different factions and become #1 on the global leaderboard. That's in addition to the "Noms de Guerre" special titles, some of which require insane circumstances (some titles are only unlocked for having save games from every previous <em>Lost Planet</em> on your hard drive, going to Capcom promotional events, etc).
</li><li> Similar to <em>Brawl's</em> challenges, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> has three "treasure hunts", each consisting of 120 achievement-esque challenges.

Oh, and you have absolutely no idea what reward you'll get from each one, so you could have gone to all that trouble for a pathetically weak weapon, an Idol you already have, or just Hearts.
<ul><li> One of them really takes the cake though: "Complete all chapters on Intensity 9." It's actually even harder than it sounds: since the game automatically reduces the difficulty when you die, the challenge is basically asking you to finish every stage on the highest difficulty <em>with no deaths!</em> Oh, and you can't use a feather on it either. Good luck.
</li><li> The achievement for completing Chapter 17 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">without losing a single Centurion</a>, on at least Intensity 6.0. The game fully expects you to lose <em>at least two</em> given the special dialogue you get for it, which should give you an idea of how hard beating the chapter without losing <em>any</em> is.
</li><li> Another troublesome set of achievements involves beating a boss under certain conditions. This is difficult because enemies and bosses lack health displays, forcing you to guess which hit will be the last, and if you fail to make that hit under the required conditions, you must <em>go through the whole level again</em> to make another try for that achievement. Do you try to spam melee combos and/or melee dash attacks, hoping this one will be the one, or gamble on that <em>perfect</em> charged shot? Especially angering is defeating a boss in Crisis Mode, which amounts to not only playing the guessing game as described above, but doing so on your <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint">Last Chance Hit Point</a></em>. Think that is hard? Try beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSpeedBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSpeedBattle">the Chariot Master</a> this way. Factor in the specific intensities above and you're in for one hell of a ride.
<ul><li> Let's not forget the one achievement that needs you to defeat a boss before it uses a certain attack. It basically turns <em>the entire battle</em> into one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>. That boss being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmupBoss">Warmup Boss</a>, though, means that with the right weapon you can beat it within the first few seconds, and even if you fail, it's one of the shortest levels in the game anyway.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> gives you "Stormbringer", a trophy/achievement for S-ranking all levels on Revengeance difficulty. This wouldn't be so bad, if not for the fact that a <em>very, very large</em> amount of the ranked fights in the game are hidden, some very nefariously. It's not so much a matter of getting S-ranks in the fights as it is actually finding the damn things. Oh, and if you miss one or get even an A-rank on one and you reach a checkpoint? You have to restart the entire mission and do all the previous fights all over again! Have fun.
<ul><li> "Tearing Away the Disguise". Destroy all of the humanoid Dwarf Gekkos during story mode. What makes this hard? You have to do it <em>all in one playthrough</em>. No going back to the title screen. The first one appears in Chapter 2, and the last one appears in Chapter 7. This means you have to play from Chapter 2 to Chapter 7 <em>in one sitting</em>, and kill all the humanoid Dwarf Gekkos. Miss one and hit a checkpoint? Go all the way back to Chapter 2 and try again!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em> has "Gold Revenge" and "Campaign Gold", for getting gold medals on all the challenge missions and the campaigns respectively. Simply completing a lot of these missions is hard enough, let alone the various requirements for a gold medal, and if you have any DLC you have to do all of them with each available character to get all the achievements.
<ul><li> To elaborate, each of the campaign challenges are combinations of three combat, predator or combined challenges, but with a set number of handicaps/powerups for each campaign that you have to sort between the challenges. There are more handicaps than powerups, which means one of the challenges will probably become easier, but the other two will be much harder. This is exacerbated by the fact that some handicaps will clash with the objectives of a challenge (for instance, you can choose a handicap that won't let you perform silent takedowns from behind while one of the challenge's objectives is precisely that you have to perform one of those) and the game will let you choose them anyway, and if you don't sort things properly, you might have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">restart the whole campaign from the start</a>.
</li><li> Worse, Batman is easily the most versatile of all the playable challenge characters, which means every other challenge you play as any other character will be objectively harder. Combat challenges aren't so bad, but the predator challenges can range from hard to hair-rippingly irritating. Catwoman has no defense capabilities, no means of performing a distance takedown and is the slowest one at climbing. Nightwing's movement is ridiculously slow in every way and his most powerful ability is also the most limited and inaccurate. Neither of them can glide, limiting their movement. Robin is easier than them, but in contrast the objectives for his challenges are the most demanding ones. Prepare for several hours of frustration, particularly since you have to learn to use a new character every time you finish with another one.
</li><li> All the <em>Arkham</em> games have challenge medals like this, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> featured the odd Predator Mode challenge involving explosive gel, which was pretty much broken the minute you picked up the proximity gel upgrade. This upgrade causes the gel to blow up when someone comes near it, good in a pinch but ruinous for a complicated challenge. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em> brought the damn stuff back and suffers from the same challenge-ruining problems. Also, the "Upgrade Available!" prompt is a flashing, obstructive prompt that will never go away until you take it, so if you've reached max level, you're going to have to put up with it pretty much forever just to complete some challenges.
<ul><li> WB announced they'll be shutting down the servers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em> at the end of 2016. That means that all the online achievements will be now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">unobtainable</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai">Afro Samurai</a></em> has the Kunoichi Suicide Queens achievement. It required you to cut off the head, hands, and feet of a group of enemies. Because the Kunoichi in the game practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheFu">She-Fu</a> <em>and</em> have low health, it is damn near impossible to actually succeed in cutting the appropriate body parts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transistor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Transistor">Transistor</a></em>: Risk() requires completing five battles with all 10 Limiters activated. Surviving one battle is a minor miracle, let alone five.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bastion">Bastion</a></em> has the lovely "About the Author", achieved by beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">the Stranger's Dream</a> with all ten idols activated. Beating the Stranger's Dream is hard enough, but the idols mean that the enemies are faster, hit harder, take more damage, drop an explosive when killed, <em>never</em> drop health potions, have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, and can at random times reflect attacks or <em>become invincible</em>. Good luck.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition</a> has a number of challenging/time consuming achievements (mostly involving beating various difficulties with S ranks on all missions) the most potentially horrible one is <em>Untouchable</em>. How does it work? You need to beat the final boss of the Bloody Palace, Dante, with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a></em>. This wouldn't be so bad, but if you get hit once while fighting him, you have to start all over again. A good run in the Bloody Palace takes about an hour and a half. And Dante is already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. Unless you can scum him out or are profoundly skilled this will be a nightmare.
<ul><li> There's also <em>Down a Notch</em>. Each major boss has an achievement which requires you to beat them with an SSS ranking on Son of Sparda difficulty or higher. For some bosses it's easy to do; for others it's a challenge, since it's not enough to just get the SSS rank during the fight; you need to still have the ranking as the boss dies. It essentially means you need to defeat each boss quickly, stylishly, and not get hit once your combo has started. What makes <em>Down a Notch</em> so much harder than the other similar achievements? It's the achievement for Dante, who as mentioned above, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> and is difficult to hit and avoid being hit by.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarChainsOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarChainsOfOlympus">God of War: Chains of Olympus</a></em> has "Heavy Hitter". Execute a 1000-hit combo. Most enemies die in 10-20 hits. Good luck. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarGhostOfSparta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarGhostOfSparta">God of War: Ghost of Sparta</a></em> has an identical achievement called "Greatest Hits". And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII">God of War III</a></em> has "Hit Man", which is the same achievement again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LetItDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LetItDie">Let It Die</a></em> has "Flirting Virtuoso", an incredibly tedious achievement requiring you to capture 100 fighters from other players. This is not something that happens quickly; some players don't have any capturable fighters, and you can only take one fighter per raid and the opportunity to capture comes up rarely. When you <em>do</em> get the chance to capture, you have to either wait until you're done with the raid or just drop everything to pull it off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> subverts this by allowing the player to simply <em>buy</em> the achievements with in-game currency, allowing one to replace skill with determination, if a <em>lot</em> of it. However, earning the privilege of buying achievements requires making it to the end of the game's third campaign.

Gameplay-wise, touching Memorious's information kiosk at all is completely optional, as it is possible to assemble the Council Code without Memorious's part; it also doesn't help that the word chain leading to it is considered the hardest puzzle in the entire game. The achievement takes tpoehe word search up to eleven, requiring looking at <em>every single entry</em> in the kiosk - both with and without Memorious's monocle. To make matters worse, the achievement was bugged in the initial release, where a couple of entries refused to trigger when their keywords were typed in, thus rendering the goal unreachable until a patch fixed the issue.
<ul><li> Slightly less difficult, but still frustrating, is "We're all in this together", which requires getting all possible robots to appear in the "good" ending. Whether or not each of them follows Horatio depends on the solutions to specific puzzles, meaning that the player has to meet the criteria for getting every character on a single playthrough. This involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">a lot of work</a>.

There's also "Trying to Cut Down", requiring playing through the entire game with Lauren smoking only 20 cigarettes, which is a lot harder than it sounds given she smokes several in cutscenes and lights one up <em>every time</em> the player takes control of Joey instead.
</li><li> <em>Blackwell Epiphany</em> has "Snow Plow", another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> achievement, and "Softly Softly", requiring that you only make 450 footsteps throughout the entire game. The latter was outright <em>impossible</em> on the Steam version for a while, as it listed the requirement as 350 instead, which couldn't be done, though a later update fixed that.

For example:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">"Go Outside"</a> requires not playing the game for five years <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(though you can cheat to get this one fairly simply... it involves resetting your system's clock)</span>.
</li><li> To get "Commitment", you must play the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, and <em>only</em> a Tuesday. "You Can't Jump" refers to a mechanic that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Unachievable</a></em>, which periodically gets changed by the game developer once people figure out how to get it (and which also is randomized &mdash; you only get it by fulfilling the conditions of getting it about one time in 15, meaning that it is hard to tell what, exactly, you did to earn it), although, it can be cheated.
</li><li> <em>8888888</em> is easier, but the description is just <em>88888888</em> so good luck figuring that out. You get it by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">typing the number "8" on the keypad in the Boss's Office eight times.</span>

"Perfect Crime" requires such a specific, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> sequence of events over the course of the whole game that many guides recommend getting it on your first playthrough, because you have to pretty much play the entire game in a very specific way. "All Endings" requires... well, seeing all the endings. This is a lot harder than it sounds - the ending of this game is essentially split into four parts for all four characters, so in total there are seventeen different ending clips that can play depending on what happened to each character. At the absolute minimum, seven playthroughs are required.

Class A apparently has one rule where couples who take part must sing. However, the judges will only accept one combination of phrases. Otherwise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">they will declare no winner</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> You can win the competition by copying the other team's sequence consisting of all the non-essential Ham-Chats you learned throughout the game, and putting "Lalala" at the end.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternate Reality&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ingress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ingress">Ingress</a></em> medals. By nature of being a GPS-based game, some medals can become easier in certain geographical locations, some harder or outright impossible. And you <em>need</em> medals in order to level up to Level 9 and beyond. Specific examples:
<ul><li> The "Guardian" medal requires you to maintain continuous control over a Portal for an extended period of time. The lowest tier is at 3 days, and the highest tier is at 150 days. If you don't live near, work near, or regularly visit a portal, or if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">enemy players greatly outnumber players you're allied with</a>, getting the medals for 10 days or more, or even just 3 days, can become extremely difficult. If the Portal gets grayed out, your ownership streak ends, which can prove infuriating if you were going after the highest-level Guardan badges. A common strategy is to have multiple Guardian portals in completely separate locations, in case one of them gets wiped out.
</li><li> "Sojourner" is similar to Guardian in that it relies on a streak; this one involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay">consecutively hacking portals within 24-hour intervals</a>. The badge starts at 15 days and tops out at 360, i.e. <em>nearly a whole year.</em> Forget to hack for the day, or end up in a situation where you can't play (such as a long-term medical emergency, losing or damaging your phone, or traveling someplace with no local portals)? Hope you weren't almost at black! And unlike the Guardian badge, which at least allows you to save face by having another player recharge your portal if you're not available to do it or have multiple Guardian portals in case one goes down, there's no safeguards for Sojourner. In fact, even if you <em>do</em> play daily, it's possible to break your streak still by playing only in the morning one day, then waiting until evening of the next day to play again.
</li><li> "Seer" requires successfully submitting new portals; 10 submissions gets you the first tier, and the highest tier is at 5000. Depending on where you live, most portal candidates will already have become portals, so unless you're a world traveler of sorts with a way to have Internet on your smartphone no matter where you go, or happen to live someplace where <em>Ingress</em> is unheard-of, getting the final medal tier is pretty much impossible. If it's not impossible, then the manual portal review system will certainly slow things down, as it can take as long as <em>half a year</em> for a submitted portal to be processed.
</li><li> "Pioneer" and "Explorer" require capturing and hacking <em>unique</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02qtl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note02qtl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02qtl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">e.g. doing the same action on two different portals counts as 2 unique portals, but doing that particular action on one portal twice only counts as one unique portal</span> portals, respectively. Simple enough if you live someplace populated with portals, hard if you live in the middle of nowhere.
</li><li> "Recruiter" requires using the email invite feature to invite new players to <em>Ingress</em> and get them to Level 3 at the least. Depending on your social connections and skills this medal can either be easy to level up or a nightmare. It doesn't help that many people treat invites to services and games as spam.
</li><li> "Translator" requires completing Glyph sequences. What makes it particularly frustrating is that although the number of Glyphs to memorize varies with Portal level, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOrNothing">you will only get points towards towards the Translator medal if you correctly replicate every Glyph in the sequence; there is no "partial credit" if you miss so much as a single Glyph in the sequence</a>.
</li><li> "Illuminator" requires you to make Control Fields, and unlike the Mind Controller medal, counts Mind Units (which is determined by how much area a Field covers) rather than how many fields you've created. If you're not one for fields that require non-trivial travel, which can be difficult to set up in crowded metros where long Portal Links can come down almost as soon as they're set up, even the first Illuminator medal can take a long time.

On top of all that, the achievement is glitched, so even if you do fulfill all the requirements you might not get it, leaving you no option other than to delete the save and start all over again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LollipopChainsaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LollipopChainsaw">Lollipop Chainsaw</a></em> has some very easy trophies/achievements for the most part, but there are two that are hard to get: "Love Nick" and "No Fear of Heights". "Love Nick" isn't <em>hard</em>, it just takes a very long time to get. As for "No Fear of Heights", you have to get through the gondola mini-game in Chapter 4 <em>without shooting</em>. This is very frustrating, because the mini-game constantly drops objects on you that will lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> when they land on you.

<ul><li> This page was inspired by the many fruitless attempts to beat the Score Attack mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">BlazBlue: Continuum Shift</a></em>, not so much to unlock the Unlimited characters as to get the two achievements for doing so. Score Attack in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCalamityTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCalamityTrigger">BlazBlue</a></em> was no picnic either, but in CS the CPU's difficulty level is turned up past "Hell" and into "Sadist". Inescapable combos, impossibly fast reaction times, no continues, and four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK boss</a>es in a row as the final bosses combine for a hellish experience.
<ul><li> In CS2, there's a medal for clearing all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a>es in a specific Legion 1.5 stage. On Stage 6, this is a <em>very</em> tall order, as one of those consists of, in order, Unlimited Hakumen, Nu-13, Unlimited Mu-12, Unlimited Hazama and Unlimited Ragna. Oh, by the way, Nu-13 is for all purposes Unlimited Lambda-11.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanaHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanaHeart">Arcana Heart</a> 3</em>'s Score Attack is no joke either. But the real hell is its Final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a>. Parace L'Sia, a boss so famously hard that not only does it put each of the bosses of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">BlazBlue: Continuum Shift</a>'s Score Attack mode to shame, but it might even go on to put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNKPlaymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNKPlaymore">SNK Playmore</a>'s Entire Boss Library to shame. Unlike Blazblue, you do have unlimited continues for the score attack mode. Thing is, you will NEED THEM in order to get past the last boss.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks">Arc System Works</a> actually <em>toned down</em> the difficulty for the toughest achievement in its more recent fighting games compared to their earlier game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleFantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleFantasia">Battle Fantasia</a></em>. That game still has the dubious honor of possessing their most infamous Achievement requirement (and possibly the single hardest Achievement in the history of fighting games), aptly named "You Want Me To WHAT?!". What does it require you to do? Simple (not)... you must parry all 22 hits of the final boss's Super Move flawlessly, and win the fight <em>at full health</em>. Yes, it's as hideously hard as it sounds. Yes, it means you have to be an absolute parry god and do a perfect match. To put things in perspective, Daigo's infamous EVO comeback only required him to parry Chun Li's Super (15 hits), and he didn't have to win with full health against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a> with at least two unblockable moves. You do the math.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena">Persona 4: Arena</a></em> has 3 of these.
<ul><li> "Combo Crazy" requires you to complete every character's missions in Challenge Mode. The catch? Not only does each mission get progressively harder, but the 30th mission for each character is a specific combo that has no command prompts, requiring you to freestyle it in order to complete it. And most of the time, they're all MUCH harder than the 29 missions you just did. Aigis' and Elizabeth's deserve special mention, because for Aigis you need to make a combo that uses <strong>ALL</strong> of her special moves <strong>AND</strong> supers, and for Elizabeth you need to make a combo that utilizes <strong>BOTH</strong> of her Mahamaon and Mamudoon, which are instant kill traps that don't activate until 10 seconds have passed on the clock.
</li><li> "Tres Bien" requires you to beat Score Attack with one character. Now you might be thinking "Oh, it's just like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> one, I'll just exploit the AI and be done with it in no time." Wrong. Every character you fight is not only on a difficulty higher than Hell, they're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a> versions with buffed stats, and past Stage 6 most characters have a x2.0 or x3.0 damage multiplier active in addition to their special buffs. And of course, you only get one shot.
</li><li> And if you thought that was hard, "C'est Magnifique" requires you to beat Score Attack with <em><strong>all characters</strong></em>. Yeah, have fun with that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>
<ul><li> <em>Brawl</em> has its fair share of difficult challenges, the worst of which include clearing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Intense</a>, clearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee">100-Man Brawl</a> with all characters, and probably worst of all, trying to get a set amount of kills on Cruel Brawl. (Actually the last one can be done fairly easily with Jigglypuff as long as you time your floating right: just float a little off stage, go underneath the stage and cling on to the other side; hopefully some of the Mooks fell off trying to attack you.) Luckily, there's the Hammers that auto-clear a challenge for you, but they don't work on some of the achievements (in the US version, that is). After that, there is also the insane amount of time you'll be spending trying to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">every sticker in the game.</a> There are seven hundred, and they only appear by random drop.
</li><li> <em>Melee</em> had one trophy received by obtaining every possible bonus you could at the end of a match. While about 90 percent or so were easy to get either through skill or sheer luck, there was one bonus called "Lethal Weapon" which involves you using a character's <em>entire</em> move set on an opponent <em>without</em> using consecutive moves, which means all of the basic moves, special moves, throws, and everything else in that character's arsenal had to connect with an opponent. This is especially difficult with using directional moves since the attacks have properties that restrict buffering additional attacks in weird ways, so you might do another forward attack when you try to do an upward attack, or something like that. The best part about this, is you have to connect all of these moves on <em>one</em> opponent <em>without</em> defeating them. Have fun trying this, and be proud if you ever achieve this bonus.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> bonus, which will frustrate many people. You have to get through either Classic, Adventure, or All-Star mode <em>without taking a single point of damage.</em> The easiest way to do this is to set the difficulty to the easiest level, and go to All-Star mode, considering that any other way classifies as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>.
</li><li> Beating the 15 minute melee with endless polygon fighters can qualify for this, even <em>with</em> the Donkey Kong earthquake trick, mainly because it can be very exhausting without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">turbo controller.</a>
</li><li> Beating Very Hard Mode in All-Star Mode to get the bonus and get the Mew Trophy at the same time, which is just as hard as it sounds. Hope you have <em>a lot of coins</em> handy, because you're going to need them considering this proves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a> on epic levels.
</li></ul></li><li> In the fourth game's Classic Mode, there's the Challenge for beating Classic Mode on Intensity setting 9.0, the highest. In addition to every enemy - from the random first encounter up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Master Hand &amp; Crazy Hand</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Master Core</a> - fighting, hitting, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">cheating</a> their hardest, a single loss means you're screwed. Why? Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful">in addition to deducting from your coin reward and taking away some of your earned prizes, selecting Continue automatically reduces the Intensity by 0.5 with no way to raise it again</a>. And with each run-through of Intensity 9.0 costing 2200 Gold per go, it will cost you if you do badly. Also, you can't use a Golden Hammer on this one. Have fun.
<ul><li> The 3DS version of the challenge is a little more forgiving, as it allows you to customize your character. In the Wii U version, customization has to be turned off. The Wii U version also adds in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Fortress</span>, which adds yet another section onto the madness. Hope you like getting blasted into a deadly wall by those damn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">laser flowers</a> after enduring all that madness!
</li></ul></li><li> There's the challenge for obtaining all custom outfits, headgear, and special moves, which will likely be one of the last challenges you beat. 12 custom outfits and 48 custom headgear might seem like a lot, but that's nothing compared to the special moves. Every character except Palutena and the Mii Fighters have eight alternate special moves, so that comes to a grand total of <strong>376 moves</strong>. There's no guarantee you'll get a new move when you earn an item, so this one's all up to luck and lots of grinding.
</li><li> The challenges for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">Cruel Smash</a>. The enemies' AI is at maximum level, they're as durable as normal fighters, and their attacks deal about four times as much knockback. An uncharged smash attack from them is a guaranteed KO at just 30% for most fighters. If you thought you could beat them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">by jumping off the stage, where they would follow you to their death</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">they don't do that in this game.</a> They'll huddle by the ledge, waiting for you to come back so they can gang up on you. Just getting <em>one</em> KO in Cruel Smash is cause for celebration. In the 3DS version, you just need two and four KOs... but in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> version, you have to: earn four KOs as Pit, who lacks a counter, survive for one minute as Luigi (<em>far</em> more difficult than it sounds), and the worst, earn <em><strong>eight</strong></em> KOs, one of which specifically requires Lucina (and <em>will</em> happen at the same time, likely). You can't use a Golden Hammer on the one that requires Lucina. It all comes down to luck and spamming counters. But mostly luck.
</li><li> So you managed to beat Classic Mode on Intensity 9.0 without customizing your character? Great, now try clearing that exact same Intensity <strong>without losing a single life</strong>. At Intensity 9.0 the CPU's defense and offense is nearly perfect. You literally have to be packing the absolute best attack, defense, and speed modifiers in order to get through the challenge and even then there's still the Fighting Mii Team, which has limited knock-back now due to the difficulty, and after all that you have Master Hand, Crazy Hand, and all five parts of Master Core, which you have to be absolutely perfect in defense in order to not be softened up by any of the four forms in order to not lose a life. Oh, and you could get your butt handed to you by a metal or giant opponent who randomly shows up due to the 'intruder alert' mechanic of Classic Mode that was only <strong>just</strong> introduced.
</li><li> Try beating All-Star Mode (with any fighter and specifically as Zero Suit Samus and Captain Falcon) <strong>without healing.</strong> You have to go through seven rounds in a row, with six to seven fighters per round, all without losing a single life. Although All-Star Mode reduces the amount of knockback you take from attacks (but <em>not</em> projectiles and stage hazards), you'll easily be in the hundreds of damage by the end. Normally, you will <em>need</em> those healing items. Attempting this one on any difficulty above Easy is just asking for endless pain.
</li><li> Beating All-Star Mode on Hard as Duck Hunt is one of those challenges that seems easy, but ends up resulting in too much effort and pain for something so easy-sounding unless you've mastered the character. Hard difficulty makes the fighters much more aggressive from the very first fight: they won't hesitate to throw you around or gang up on you, and they can dodge and shield like pros. Your limited healing items will <em>really</em> start to bite when you end up having over 100% damage but don't want to waste an item. Now try to do that with a character who has few good launching moves and has smash attacks (about the only good source of knockback) that are <em>extraordinarily</em> difficult to use.
</li><li> Smash Tour has a few challenges dedicated to it, but recovering the stat boosts a Metroid stole from you may be one of the more annoying challenges in the mode, let alone the <em>game</em>. First of all, it is entirely random whether a Metroid will even show up or not. Even if it does, the Metroid has to bump into you. It will then teleport to another part of the map, so you have to bump into it again to receive the stat boosts it stole from you. This is easier said than done because you'll fail the challenge if the Metroid bumps into another opponent, even if you get the stat boosts from them. It's also possible that the Metroid will bump into you to steal your stat boosts, and an opponent will bump into it to steal them from you. It all comes down to extreme luck if the Metroid appears and if you get it to bump into you twice. Oh, and the lower the row of the challenges are, the easier it's supposed to be. This challenge, in particular, is the 3rd row from the <em>bottom</em>. Yikes.
</li><li> Classic on 9.9 in <em>Ultimate</em> is just as tricky as in <em>For 3DS and Wii U</em>, albeit for different reasons. Unlike the previous games, you can't simply set the Intensity to 9.9, you must <em>earn</em> your way to 9.9 from 5.0 through successive Nice Plays, which get progressively tougher to accomplish as the AI scales up in difficulty. The boss battles of each route are also tougher than in previous games, as they are character-dependent and are surprisingly strong and sturdy. Combine all of this with the fact that you only get one life per stage and using a Continue below 9.9 locks you out of getting 9.9 in the first place, and you're in for an incredibly daunting challenge.
</li><li> One Smash challenge involves getting 3 meteor KOs within 3 minutes during a match against <em>4 Level 9 CPUs</em>. Not only is landing even one meteor KO difficult for a new player to do (since most moves that do so have to be sweetspotted), but having to land three of them in such a short timeframe against a lot of highly aggressive and competent computer players (which also like to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangUpOnTheHuman">Gang Up on the Human</a>) can become pure agony very fast. Even if you are good at landing meteor smashes, the computers tend to congregate around the ledge, making landing most meteor smashes even more difficult. Abusing Bayonetta's down smash (which has the largest meteor hitbox in the game and also punishes this CPU behavior) is about the only way most people who aren't pro <em>Smash</em> players can get this one, and it cannot be bypassed with a Golden Hammer.
</li><li> One of the Spirit Board Challenges requires you to challenge and defeat ten Legend Class Spirits. Not only are Legend Spirits quite rare, many of them are especially difficult without fight-specific cheese strategies (many of which qualify for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>). Thankfully, <em>obtaining</em> the Spirit itself is not part of the Challenge, merely defeating them is enough.
</li><li> If you don't intend on using a Golden Hammer to clear it, playing 200 Quick Battles in the Online page is a huge grind and especially bad for people who don't have reliable internet for online play.
</li><li> Winning against an Advanced class 3 times without using a spirit team is pure hell. Without a primary spirit, you are <em>extremely</em> underpowered, and spirit items will barely help you, considering a single weak attack from the enemy would be able to do over 30% while a smash attack won't even do about 10%. Another thing is that this has to be done in the Spirit Board mode, meaning you get no benefits from the Adventure Mode Skill tree and you only get one try per encounter (three as of Version 2.0.0).
</li><li> Doing the entire final stage in World of Light <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">without being KOed once</a> is absolute hell. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This means you have to lose no character against Galeem and Dharkon or on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiseToTheChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiseToTheChallenge">Rise to the Challenge</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> immediately before. In addition, the fight itself is considered as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. This is because you have to dodge a lot of attacks coming at once, some of them being very hard to avoid especially on Hard mode. While Critical Health Healing or Great Autoheal coupled with a very powerful spirit make this easier, it can still be a frustrating nightmare trying not to lose any particular fighter, especially considering Galeem has an Off Waves-esque attack that can do a lot of knockback, that needs incredible timing to dodge, and appears in random patterna. However, it's possible to simply turn down the difficulty setting just for this one level, as this doesn't invalidate the challenge.</span>

This requires beating him a grand total of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">ten times with ten different wrestlers.</a> As a refresher, Undertaker counters nearly every strike you throw at him, has severely buffed resistance against all attacks, can sometimes teleport behind you and do his finisher after you execute yours in the ring, and can even <em>counter your pin attempts</em> into a Chokeslam for Retro 'Taker or the Hell's Gate submission hold for Modern 'Taker.
<ul><li> Also related to the "Defeat the Streak Mode" is the "Epic Match" Achievement, in which you must kick out of Taker's pin attempts 5 times.

What makes this so hard? <em>DIO's AI <strong>hates</strong> using that attack.</em> Almost every time the computer gets the necessary meter to use "It's a steamroller!", it will instead use DIO's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Time Stands Still</a> move. Unless you deliberately set it up in a two-player match, expect a lot of fruitless, frustrating matches.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> game, Saint Seiya Soldier's Soul, has several hidden trophies for referencing certain parts of the series. What makes them annoying however unlike other anime based games like JoJo directly above, is that most of them require you to do the action three times, meaning that even if you do find the correct scenario by random chance, you still won't get the achievement. The update allowing players to view hidden trophies removed a lot of the hassle though.
</li><li> The Wii version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> has a few extra challenges you can do for each boxer when facing them in an exhibition match. Some of the more brutal ones include
<ul><li> Defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnMilk">Soda Popinski</a> in 109 seconds or less. Popinski's a pretty challenging opponent as is, so adding a very short time limit only ups the factor. Doesn't help that some walkthroughs on how to do this challenge list an incorrect method.
</li><li> Defeating Title Defense Soda Popinski without stopping his health refilling moves. Taking what's basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> and letting him constantly heal the damage you give him whenever he feels like it? Recipe for disaster.
</li><li> Knocking Title Defense <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Mr. Sandman</a> down in under 33 seconds. The challenge requires using three-star punches, so perfectly counter-punching his already-quick moves is necessary here. Oh, and if you get hit, mistime your star punches or don&#146;t get a star off one of your counter punches, you might as well reset the fight then and there.
</li><li> The entirety of Mac's Last Stand mode. Take on the entirety of the Title Defense roster. You only get three losses. Oh, and you can reset or quit the matches. Oh, and you only get one shot at it per save file. Oh, and you have to go through it to unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. Oh and there's a chance that you can fail the challenge before said boss shows up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">meaning you won't be able to unlock them if you fail.</a> Sound fun?

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilDaggers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilDaggers">Devil Daggers</a></em> has only one achievement, which requires you to survive 500 seconds (8m20s) in a run. This sounds simple enough, until you realize that only 0.1% of players have it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry">Far Cry</a> Classic</em> has "Ninja Jack", which requires you to retrieve the keycard on the Research level without being detected. Said keycard is in a hut surrounded by about a dozen enemy patrols, and even on Easy difficulty, the slightest noise or hint of movement will alert them. It is best to have picked up the silenced MP5 back in the Fort level and saved its ammo for this occasion. And you can forget about trying this achievement on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Realistic difficulty</a>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">stealth is all but useless</a>. A close second is "In the Zoo", for which you have to clear Treehouse, the level where you first fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Trigens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">without dying</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> has "Zombie Chopper", requiring the player to pass through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Ravenholm</a> using <strong>only</strong> the Gravity Gun (even a single swing of the crowbar invalidates the achievement). This might not seem so bad, at first, because there's a lot a random crap to use as ammunition, but it is hell inside the mines or when roof-hopping. More entertainingly, it's possible to use the developer console to enable the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">Dark Energy Gravity Gun</a> without turning on cheats, letting you get the achievement that way.
<ul><li> Or you can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> bring Dog's rollermine "ball" with you and let zombies "play" with it</span>.
</li><li> Also "Vorticough", awarded for finding a singing Vortigaunt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> in the level "Water Hazard". An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> that you probably wouldn't know existed but for the achievement list, and requires you to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use your airboat as a ramp to get up to a culvert near the end of the level</span>. If that description makes it sound easy, it <em>isn't</em>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Said culvert is a single long drainage path, followed by a turn, <strong>full of radioactive sewage that drains your health.</strong> Considering the fact that this comes <em>directly after the</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Combine Helicopter</a></em> <em>boss fight</em>...</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Episode One</em> has "The One Free Bullet", requiring the player to complete the entire game firing only <em>a single bullet</em> (needed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootOutTheLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootOutTheLock">open a lock</a>). You do get free use of explosives and the crowbar, but those are not plentiful. You'll be falling back on the Gravity Gun a lot.
</li><li> <em>Episode Two</em> has two of these: "Little Rocket Man" and "Get Some Grub". The latter requires squishing all 333 Antlion grubs, some of which are deviously hidden. 333 is a lot, and they're stretched over several sections. "Little Rocket Man" requires you bring a gnome found in the communication shed (which is itself not immediately visible in the first place) all the way to the rocket in the last section. This isn't so bad at first. You can leave it by an elevator for most of the Antlion section, and it's possible to fling it all the way to the exit when you are trying to get to the car. After that, driving through vast stretches of mountain in a car with no trunk (you have to physically wedge the little gnome into part of the car then drive at half-speed to keep it there), and finding yourself in scripted events which will outright erase the gnome, it becomes downright infuriating.
</li></ul></li><li> Inspired by "Little Rocket Man," <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa">Black Mesa</a></em> has "Rare Specimen", gotten by sending the hidden hat to Xen. You need to find a hidden prop you might not even know exists, carry it through enemies and hazards that can easily have it lost, and drop it somewhere specific (in this case, the teleporter to Xen). Fortunately you don't need to carry it through the entire game, as it's found in the same chapter it needs to be dropped, but you do need to carry it through the teleporter puzzle, which is finicky enough without having your movement slowed and sight blocked by a huge purple hat. And to complicate it even further? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There's a <em>fake hat</em>.</span> The Steam release makes it even <em>more</em> difficult by putting the hat near the beginning of the game &mdash; specifically, right after the Resonance Cascade. If you thought moving it through the last level was hard, try carrying it through all of the ones beforehand.
</li><li> Beat Veteran on ANY <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> game. You're just slightly more hardy than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, and thus need to seek cover regularly. The enemy knows this and will herd you away from cover with liberal use of grenades, which can kill you if you're within their blast radius. And your invincible allies? Your squad leader may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">"Alpha Male of the Human Race"</a>, but he has no clue how to work the sights on his gun.
<ul><li> <em>World At War</em> is the worst. One level pits you against an omnipotent Nazi sniper with a quick trigger finger, god-like accuracy, and bullets that are apparently made of super-radiation that can kill you if they so much as touch any part of you. Oh, and he takes 3 bullets to kill (no, lodging a single round in his brain stem will not kill him. It's 3 shots, PERIOD).
</li><li> Another hair-tearing achievement in <em>World at War</em>, from the very same level, is Gunslinger, which requires you to kill a Nazi general with a pistol shot. Mind you, this shot is intended for a <em>sniper rifle,</em> since you're on a rooftop a couple hundred meters away from him and pistol ironsights are minuscule. To put the cherry on top, he ducks under the automobile he rides in on the second you fire a shot, so you essentially <em>have</em> to do this on your first try, and it's not entirely obvious where the <em>sole guaranteed pistol in the level</em> is (hint: it's not at the spot you snipe the general from). Be prepared for a LOT of checkpoint reverting.
</li><li> Another achievement required you to kill three enemies with one shot. There's a <em>single</em> part of the game where this is quite easy to do, but unless you're actually trying to get the achievement it probably wouldn't occur to you to try.
</li><li> Arguably one of the worst is 'The Sum of All Zeros', which requires you to shoot down 50 Zero fighters on the mission 'Black Cats'. You are expected to do this in the middle of a chaotic sea-to-air battle while simultaneously rescuing sailors. Worse still, many of the Zeros are kamikaze attackers, meaning that you have a <em>very</em> limited timeframe to shoot them down before they plow into friendly ships. Have fun!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em> has "Your Show Sucks", attained by shooting all of televisions showing Al-Asad's speech in the level Charlie Don't Surf. Seems simple? Guess what, the last leg of the mission has you raiding a <em>broadcast station</em>, and there are a total of <em><strong>144 televisions in the entire level.</strong></em> Even worse, the destroyed televisions <strong>reset</strong> if you die before you hit checkpoints. Paranoia abounds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Mile High Club</a>, also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em>, makes the rest of the Veteran campaign look like a cakewalk. You have to navigate an airplane with no space to move or take cover, kill hordes of terrorists without grenades, and you only have one minute to clear the entire level. If you somehow make it to the end, you <em>must</em> get a headshot on the terrorist with the hostage, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">"Only veterans get headshots."</a> If you perfectly completed the rest of the level, you'll only have five seconds to make the shot anyway. Entire <em>guides</em> have been written on this one achievement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyAdvancedWarfare">Advanced Warfare</a></em> has Wheelman, which involves clearing the Hover Bike sequence at the end of Aftermath... without hitting any obstacles or taking damage. The track is about a minute long and has three checkpoints, but it's very easy to screw up and it isn't even very clear if you HAVE screwed up. And if you fail, you'll have to redo the whole mission over again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Black Ops 3</a></em> has "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">No One Will Believe You</a>," which requires you to beat the campaign on Realistic difficulty. So named because on this difficulty, <strong>a</strong> <em><strong>single shot</strong></em> <strong>from any weapon will kill you.</strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersWarForCybertron">Transformers: War for Cybertron</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">"Wait! I Still Function!"</a> can only be obtained in Co-Op Campaign or Escalation mode. To get it you must lose all of your health and destroy three enemies in the ten-second "System Failure" mode before you blow up. The problem with this is that you lose your targeting reticule, rendering it almost impossible to aim correctly, you can't move to get more ammo should you run out, any damage you receive while downed cuts down on said ten-second time limit, and it's near-impossible for your online teammates to tell when you're going for this achievement/trophy so they won't run over and revive you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> has many achievements that are difficult, tedious, or require astounding luck (which is inevitable when there are more than <em>five hundred</em> of them). Some can be obtained in normal play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">with lots of time</a>, and lots can be "cheated" if you have one or two friends and an empty server, but some are a cut above the rest:
<ul><li> Many Medic achievements either required a lot of fighting for a class whose main purpose is healing, or were otherwise outright counter-intuitive to the success of the team. When the Medic's achievement pack was released, completing <em>all</em> of the achievements was the only way to obtain the useful Ubersaw item. Because they were so difficult and often required farming, they were one of the reasons Valve later changed the item system from achievement-based to drop-based.
<ul><li> "Specialist" requires the player to heal <em>10,000</em> points of damage in a single life, and overheal does <em>not</em> count for this. Even if the Medic is incredible at surviving, most games don't even last long enough for the Medic to hit 4000.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">You'll Feel a Little Prick</a>" (and the Scout's equivalent "Doctoring the Ball", so you have to pull off this feat <em>twice</em>.) requires getting 3 kills with a single Ubercharge on a Scout, who is one of the least desirable and usable targets because of his speed. (Less so after the introduction of the Quick-Fix, and even less so when all mediguns were buffed to let the Medic match the Scout's speed while healing one, letting you give the Scout a Kritzkrieg and hope he can aim.)
</li><li> "Does it Hurt When I Do This?" requires killing 50 Scouts with the syringe guns - which translates to "kill an almost impossible-to-hit enemy who's out for your blood with a weak weapon with slow projectiles." And no, the Crusader's Crossbow does not count for this.
</li><li> The worst is probably "Big Pharma" (and the Heavy's equivalent, "Division of Labor", so again, you have to pull off this feat twice.), which require a Heavy/Medic duo to earn <em>10 kills</em> without dying, which was originally <em>20 kills without dying</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> With Friends Like These...: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">Play in a game with 7 or more players from your friends list</a>. Now, this isn't exactly too hard if you are friends with a lot of people on a server you frequent or have a large friend's list, but if you're someone who just plays random servers and/or doesn't go and add random people or accept friend invites from random people, <em>good luck to ya.</em>
<ul><li> This could also apply to Banner of Brothers (buff 5 Steam friends at once with the Buff Banner) and Brotherhood of Steel (complete a Mann vs. Machine mission with 5 Steam friends; not quite as hard to the others, as finding a good team in Mann Up mode will quite likely net you five new friends before the mission's done, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">the achievement didn't say that they had to be your friends before the mission</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Pyromancer: Deal 1,000,000 points of fire damage as a Pyro. That's basically <strong>5,000</strong> Soldiers. There are career Pyros out there that <em>still</em> don't have this one. "Tartan Spartan" is pretty much the same way, as you must deal 1,000,000 points of explosive damage as a Demoman. Both of these achievements suffer from a glitch where sometimes Steam erases all progress on them, requiring starting over from scratch.
<ul><li> Makin' Bacon: Kill <em>50 Heavies</em> with your <em>flamethrower</em>. Not only do Heavies completely outclass the Pyro's damage output at close range, but they have absurd amounts of health, the Sandvich, and Medics to combat afterburn damage as well, so you can't even rely on hit-and-run or posthumous kills. To make matters worse, <em>it only counts the default flamethrower for the achievement.</em> Most, if not all experienced Pyro players will choose the Degreaser over the default flamethrower any day.
</li><li> "Got a Light?" requires you, as a Pyro, to ignite a Spy who is using the cigarette-flicking taunt. Spies rarely taunt anyway, but they'll <em>never</em> use this taunt unless they're going for an achievement that requires using said taunt after a kill, so getting this without setting it up requires that perfect moment.
</li></ul></li><li> "Krazy Ivan" requires the Heavy to kill 50 enemies while both you and your victim are underwater. The only maps where this is even close to viable are Well and 2Fort, which have a lot of deep water, but good luck actually finding anyone who willingly goes in the water.
</li><li> The Scout achievement "A Year to Remember", which requires getting a certain number of lifetime kills. Most classes only need to kill 1,000 enemies to get their respective achievement. How many kills does the Scout need to get this achievement? <strong>2,004</strong>. This can literally take dozens of hours to do, and while dedicated Scout players will get it fairly soon, those not so good at playing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> will find themselves in a pit of frustration.
<ul><li> "Foul Territory" requires a Scout to cause an environmental death by stunning someone with the Sandman. What this translates into is hoping to smack someone with a stunball (usually at long range, as the Sandman doesn't stun enemies up close) in the path of a buzzsaw, on train tracks, or in front of the Horseless Headless Horsemann and praying that they get killed by that hazard before the stun wears off. And the Sandman isn't exactly easy to aim in the first place. It's gotten even more difficult with the Sandman being nerfed to only slow enemies instead of stopping them from moving entirely, meaning that the victim will have a chance to get out of the way.
</li></ul></li><li> "Jarate Chop" originally required you, as a Sniper, to Jarate three enemies at once and then kill them all with your Kukri. You couldn't use the Bushwacka (which always crits on Jarate'd enemies) or any other melee weapons for this one, only the default Kukri. Once you've managed to find three enemies in close proximity (good luck with that), you'd have to try to kill those three in eight seconds with a weak featureless melee weapon as the weakest melee class, who has the lowest base health. Good luck. The requirement was eventually changed to melee-killing three Jarated enemies in one life, making it more manageable (if still difficult because going melee with Sniper is risky at best).
</li><li> Most taunt kill achievements are difficult enough, but "The Man From P.U.N.C.T.U.R.E." and "Out of the Park" are probably the worst. The former requires you to get a kill with the second longest and loudest kill taunt in the game, which doesn't immediately kill until the last swing but WILL notify the enemy as you will stab him twice beforehand non-fatally. The latter doesn't just require you to get a kill with the Sandman's taunt, the longest in the game- no, you have to hope the enemy's ragdoll flies long enough and doesn't collide with anything to count the achievement.
<ul><li> "Full Spectrum Warrior", hands down <em>the</em> hardest Pyro achievement <em>and</em> hardest taunt-kill-related achievement. How to get: ignite 3 enemies with the Rainblower's taunt (it's an AoE attack). No, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">not "kill". "Ignite"</a>. Due to the way the attack is coded, you have to hit no fewer than <strong>five powerful enemies</strong> (on average; only four if they're overhealed) with a slow, loud, short-ranged, incredibly-brightly-advertised attack and hope that only the first two die. It's not even easy to get this achievement "boosted" for you because of how many friends you need working on the enemy team.
</li></ul></li><li> The "WAR!" update added "Out, Damned Scot!" and "Kilt in Action" for Soldier and Demoman respectively, requiring that you kill the other class 500 times. This is a <em>lot</em> harder than it sounds, as you need to single out one specific class on the enemy team and make sure you get the killing blow. Even with a helpful friend on the other team getting any significant progress with this achievement takes hours.
</li><li> How do you get "Best Little Slaughterhouse in Texas"? Why, just rack up a mere <em>5,000</em> lifetime kills with your sentry. Good luck getting this one without more than a 100 hours of play time just with Engineer.
</li><li> "Local Cinema Star", "Indie Film Sensation" and Blockbuster". These achievements require you to make a replay, post it on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and then get 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 views, respectively. The worst part is, while all the previously mentioned achievements have at least some kind of a strategy for you to do them, there is literally no strategy in these three. You just have to make something a bunch of people will find. There's a reason these three achievements are among the least-earned in the entire game (and if it weren't for helpful sites like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TF2replay/">this Reddit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, would likely still be THE lowest).
<ul><li> And now as of 2019, the achievement has gone from needlessly difficult to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">outright impossible</a> when Youtube updated the part of the code which TF2 used to track the video's view count, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">preventing the game on properly counting the views</a> and breaking the achievement.
</li></ul></li><li> "Terminated, Too". You have to kill another player by knocking them into the cauldron of molten metal behind the final capture point on the map cp_foundry. The main problem is that almost no one hangs around back there&mdash;they're too focused on getting that last point.
</li><li> "The Great Deflate" requires killing 79 players who have Balloonicorn pets. Never mind that killing that many players is tedious enough itself, never mind that only a few players actually have Balloonicorn, but unless you're using Pyrovision you can't even <em>see</em> which players have them and gain progress on the achievement. About <em>three percent</em> of players have this one, despite it being a general achievement obtainable by any class in any non-MVM game mode.
</li><li> Metal Massacre: kill 1 million robots in Mann vs. Machine mode. Killing robots is easy, but since you're lucky to average nearly 300 robots every half hour, this will take you a very, <em>very</em> long time. As in, <em>well over <strong>a month</strong> of playtime just in Mann vs. Machine, not counting between-wave breaks</em>. And that's a <em>generous</em> estimate.
</li><li> Valve has developed a bad habit of creating achievements that require an absurd amount of round wins on a certain map to obtain. That's not total games, that's <strong>wins</strong>. There's "The Crucible" (Foundry), with <em>137 wins</em>; "The Fight Stuff" (Doomsday), with 138 wins; "Stand and Deliver" (Standin), with 139 wins; "Process of Elimination" (Process), with 140 wins; "Snakewater Salesman" (Snakewater), with 141 wins; and "Competitive Spirit" (Helltower), with <strong>142 wins.</strong> It's going to take either months of playing a single map <em>ad nauseum</em>, or winning all those games on a solo server. These achievements are truly the least-earned in the game. Only one has a completion rate above 4%.
<ul><li> "Competitive Spirit" is the most evil, since you win Helltower not by pushing Blutarch/Redmond's corpse to the Final Terminus, but rather by grabbing the spellbook in Hell. Even if you've won in the mortal world, it's still very possible to lose in Hell.
</li></ul></li><li> The Snakewater pack added "Mutually Air-sured-destruction", where you and an enemy have to be rocket jumping, and both of you have to kill each other with a rocket <em>while you're both rocket jumping</em>. And you have to do this on Snakewater, a map almost nobody outside of competitive plays.
</li><li> Among the taunt-related achievements added in the Love &amp; War Update, none are more insidious than "Running with Scissors" and "On the Rocks," which require you to win or lose three games of Rock, Paper, Scissors in a row with a specific hand. Each possible hand is totally random and the opponent's hand is totally random, so it's all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> in the end. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note46kpj');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note46kpj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note46kpj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You have a 1 in 216 chance of getting either achievement.</span>
</li><li> The parachute-related achievements are bad not just because they're difficult to get, but because there are separate achievements for Soldier and Demoman so they have to be done twice. The "kill a parachuting enemy while parachuting" and "kill three enemies in a single parachute deploy" ones are bad enough, but the worst are "Project Excelsior" and "Operation High Dive". How do you get these? Just travel <strong>19.47 miles</strong> with the parachute. That's more than 1.2 <em>million</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Hammer_unit">hammer units<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and again, this has to be done <em>twice</em>. Still don't understand? OK, then let me make it more clear: On a good day, you'll travel around 200 hammer units per second while parachuting (as either class). If you somehow continuously move in a straight line at top speed without stopping, getting this achievement ONCE would take <strong>102 HOURS</strong>.
<ul><li> Achievements related to the Classic aren't much better - do you feel like full-charge no-scope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshotting</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">rocket/grenade jumping</a> enemy? ("Eagle Eye") Hope you're ridiculously precise when using a sniper rifle! Or how about gibbing <em>every class</em> during a single round? ("Prime Cuts")
</li><li> "May I Cut in, Too?" requires you to melee kill 10 Square Dancing players. Wouldn't be too difficult, but it's indirectly hindered because A: Not everyone has the taunt required and it's extremely unlikely you'll find enemies square dancing in the open, and B: killing players who are participating in a taunt is considered very rude, and some people simply don't want to interrupt a moment of fun. And if your attack doesn't kill someone in one hit, it's also likely that the victims will immediately stop square dancing.
</li></ul></li><li> "Carnival Of Carnage: Arms Reduction", for killing 15 players while it's A) either Halloween or a full moon, B) on the map Carnival of Carnage, and C) either Merasmus has just placed a curse on both teams to delete all non-melee weapons or you're using the Minify magic spell. Melee only kills wouldn't be THAT hard, since there's plenty of melee builds... except the melee-only curse shrinks everyone's hitbox, gives everyone a running speed boost, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">jolts you into third-person camera</a> (trust us, it's more debilitating than it sounds), and causes players to fly all over the place when hit. It's entirely possible for <em>no one to die</em> during this curse because of how ridiculously hard it is to hit anyone.
</li><li> Meet Your Match added "Tune Merasmus' Multi-Dimensional Television". In the Pass Time Bricktown map, you need to open a secret room, then activate some smudges. Problem A) It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> to how you get into the room in the first place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shoot a guitar, and have someone else else throw the ball in a secret goal that appears on the other side of the map, with no indication that you can do this)</span> Problem B) How you activate the smudges is even more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There are eight smudges. For each smudge, a specific class from a specific team needs to stand on it, I.E., one smudge needs a blue spy, and another needs a red sniper. However, again, there is no indication what classes or teams are needed for each one.</span> Problem C) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterInternetFuckwadTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterInternetFuckwadTheory">GIFT</a> is in full effect here, as anyone from either team can enter the secret room and kill you and your friends, or simply close the room again by winning the round.
</li><li> There is also the problem that Steam erases all the progress you did during the current session if your game crashes. So you've been grinding that one achievement for two hours and the game crashed? Too bad, you just wasted all this time. And this game is far from stable and tends to crash all the time. Fortunately, any achievements you managed to clear before that will stay cleared.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> games usually have at least one achievement that is an absolute nightmare to earn.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em> had ones such as "Overkill", which required you to kill 4 players within 4 seconds of each other on a ranked free-for-all game, which only had 6 players in each match. You either got really lucky or depending on the game mode, you would have to camp somewhere and hope 4 people would appear at once that you could kill before they killed each other. Other ones included trying to get a double kill with a spartan laser in the same game mode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> had "If They Came To Hear Me Beg", which had you trying to survive a fatal drop by assassinating an Elite, which came down to finding an Elite by a high enough cliff, getting lucky to fall directly behind him and then pressing the buttons at just the right time to trigger the assassination. This inspired wave after wave of thread on the Bungie.net forums with people unable to get the achievement despite trying again and again and again. When <em>Reach</em> was rereleased on the Master Chief Collection, this achievement was removed.
</li><li> <em>Reach's</em> later DLC packages also added several achievements that have to be completed on specific multiplayer maps. Many are sizable feats by themselves like "Don't Touch That!", which requires a team to shut out an enemy team in Capture the flag. These achievements are full of Fake Difficulty, because there are few options to ensure the map you will be playing is one of the DLC maps in the correct game mode. "All Alone" and "Emergency Room" are particularly guilty, as the Infection gametype has no 'DLC-Only Playlist' meaning a player has to blindly stumble into a lobby with people who happen to all own the particular map pack required to earn the achievement legitimately.
</li><li> "A Monument to All Your Sins." At least in <em>3</em>, you could get the achievement for beating Legendary campaign in multiplayer, or even in splitscreen using a second controller solely as a respawn mule. This <em>Reach</em> achievement requires you to beat Legendary <em>solo</em>.
</li><li> "One Final Firefight" in <em>Reach</em> requires you to earn 150,000 points on Lone Wolf. Even if you play on Easy with all skulls on to maximize point earning, 150k points demands hours of grinding with no saves, respawns, or checkpoints, with even Elite Generals giving only a measly 260-ish points each.
</li><li> Then there are the Bungie Vidmaster Challenges which rewarded the much desired Recon armour to anyone able to beat them all. Some were easy, like finding skulls on DLC maps, getting 50exp in a playlist, getting 7 exp on the 7th of the month. Then you had one for doing a level on legendary without firing a shot or throwing a grenade. Two of the harder ones were clearing the last levels on <em>Halo 3</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em> on legendary, with Iron on and in Ghosts or Mongooses although with good players this can be done in 30 minutes. The absolute bane of anyone getting to Recon was the "Endure" Vidmaster, which required you to survive 4 waves of enemies in <em>ODST</em> Firefight on Heroic in 4 player co-op. You were under threat from the enemies, the ever increasing difficulty, incompetent players or someone lagging out and ending the game. It takes two hours to do as well, so make sure nothing interrupts you. Even better is the fact that the game semi-regularly sends out waves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Fire grenade invisi-Brutes</a>. Plus shielded drones not only outdo them in the sheer danger factor (those alone excluded the whole enemy class from <em>Reach</em>), but the game has a hard time rendering fire and relaying it across the connection; you can imagine the lag when there's a dozen of the pricks amok. It was voted the hardest Vidmaster to get as a result.
</li><li> The par time achievements in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>: Anniversary</em> on <em>The Master Chief Collection</em> can be somewhat frustrating. "Truth and Reconciliation", a fairly long level, must be beaten in 20 minutes. "Assault on the Control Room", one of the series' longest levels? <em>15 minutes</em>. Unless level exploits are used to skip entire sections, it's nigh impossible.
</li><li> <em>The Master Chief Collection</em> for the Xbox One introduces perhaps the pinnacle of impossible <em>Halo</em> achievements: LASO Master for 50 gamerscore, earned by beating the LASO playlists for <em>Halo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">CE</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">3</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">4</a></em>. For those who do not know what LASO is, it stands for Legendary All, Skulls On. Legendary difficulty on its own is already a challenge (with <em>Halo 2</em> and <em>4</em> universally regarded as among the most difficult on Legendary, with <em>Halo CE</em> up there too), but throw in skulls that restart the ENTIRE level if you die on solo, prevent shields from recharging unless enemies are melee'd, double grenades thrown by enemies, buff enemy health and rank considerably, halve ammo in picked up weapons and so forth, and what ensues is an exercise in frustration. To get an idea of how difficult this achievement is to get, <em>The Master Chief Collection</em> was out for over a month as of December 2014. On True Achievements.com, out of 55,000 tracked gamers, only <em>12</em> had gotten the achievement, while other achievements in the collection already had scores of 12,000-50,000 gamers.
</li><li> Finding all the Skulls in any game can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, with them frequently being hidden in out-of-reach locations that may require a tricky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">Rocket or Grenade Jump</a> (e.g. the Bandana skull in <em>Halo Anniversary</em>), or having impossibly complicated methods of unlocking (e.g. the IWHBYD skull in <em>Halo 3</em>).
</li><li> "He's Unstoppable!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> of a level on Heroic or Legendary, which means no reloading from checkpoints either.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em>, you have 'Brass Balls', which requires that you beat the game on the hardest difficulty without ever using any Vita-Chambers. Beating <em>BioShock</em> on Hard is difficult enough, but if you accidentally use a Vita-Chamber somehow, you'll have to restart from the beginning.( The last bit was made a non-issue when a "Turn off Vita-chambers" option was patched in, so you'll never accidentally use one if you're gunning for the achievement.) Furthermore, the PS3 port has "I Chose the Impossible", which requires you to do the same on the exclusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Survivor</a> difficulty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em>, there's "Big Brass Balls", which is the same as the original "Brass Balls". There's also "Master Protector", which is earned by completing a Gather with a Little Sister without taking any damage <em>and</em> without anyone getting to the Little Sister. If someone grabs the Little Sister, or you get shot even once, be prepared to start all over again. Usage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> Decoy 2 (or 3) plasmid is strongly recommended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> has 'Scavenger Hunt' which requires you to complete the game in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">1999 mode</a> without using the Dollar Bill vending machines (which sell Health, Salts, and weapon ammo). With combat considerably tougher than other difficulties, that limitation <em>hurts</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">But the achievement is glitched</a>, so it'll be awarded upon completing the game on any difficulty without using the Dollar Bill vending machines.
<ul><li> And then there's the DLC <em>Clash in the Clouds</em>, which requires you to complete all 60 "Blue Ribbon Challenges", most of which can be considered "That One Achievements" on their own. Some of the hardest Blue Ribbon challenges include defeating The Siren (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>) before she can resurrect a dead body which is already on the field (hint: get rid of the bodies), defeating a Handyman before any other opponent (frequently ruined when <em>The Handyman</em> throws a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> at you), and the Defeating all enemies with only a Shotgun (when you spawn on the other side of the map from your enemies and half of them are Snipers).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> has the Nothing Special achievement, where you must not be damaged by any special infected for the <em>entire</em> campaign from start to finish. Just to clarify what you will be facing against, Hunters can leap off buildings to pounce on you, Smokers can grab and drag you away, Boomers can puke on you to summon hordes of zombies on you, and Tanks can punch you clear across or hurl rocks at you. Tight teamwork and having people constantly watch your back, on top of extreme luck, is the only way you will succeed in getting this achievement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> ups the ante of achievements that are near impossible to get:
<ul><li> Strength in Numbers requires for you and your friends to team up in a Team VS/Team Scavenge game and beat another team of friends. The problem here is that if the other team quits the game, you won't earn the achievement and rage quitting is commonplace in the game. There's also the issue of nobody playing the game mode.
</li><li> Wedding Crasher (earned in The Passing campaign) is also quite difficult to pull off since the achievement requires that A) a Charger to be in play and B) having said Charger grab a survivor and plow through 8 chairs at the wedding scene in the park. Not only the infected team is down one player if the person who is the Charger is trying to earn the achievement (since the Charger has to wait until the survivors arrive at the park), but if the charge angle is just slightly off or if the survivor target isn't lined up properly, you will miss your chance at the achievement since the chairs only appear in one spot and most survivor players actively try to avoid hanging around the chairs, making the achievement near impossible to get legitimately.
</li><li> The Real Deal requires you completing a campaign on Expert difficulty in Realism mode. To sum it up, you are playing on the highest difficulty where damage from zombies are capable of downing you in just 4 hits, Tanks instantly down you with their attacks, and the Witch will instantly kill you if she strikes. Realism mode disables glows around survivors so you can't see where anyone is at all times, respawning in a closet is no longer possible, and all common infected have increased defense and no longer die in a single shot from sniper rifles. Prepare to die and restart. A lot.
</li><li> Good Guy Nick, requiring you to play with somebody playing the game for free on a free weekend. This wasn't a big deal until Christmas 2013, when Valve offered the full game, free, as a special Christmas present. Just try to find somebody who <em>doesn't</em> own this game, and wait...wait...wait for a free weekend to occur. Which is a crapshoot in and of itself.
</li><li> Level a Charge requires you to kill a Charger with a melee weapon while they charge at you. Chargers have enough health to withstand two melee strikes and Charger AI is very finicky on whether or not it will charge at you.
</li><li> Meat Tenderizer involves playing as a Charger in VS mode and grabbing and slamming a survivor for a solid 15 seconds without interruption. Most survivor players are alert enough to gun you down if you have one of their own pinned, requiring the zombie team to coordinate their attacks to keep the survivors busy.
</li><li> Heartwarmer requires a player in VS mode to leave the safe room and bring back a dead player with a defibrillator. Not only do you need to find a defib to begin with (which also means sacrificing health kits), but you also need to hope that any survivors that die are only a mere few feet away from the safe room. Infected players will gladly jump any survivor bold enough to attempt the achievement.
</li><li> Lickety-Split requires a survivor player to cut a Smoker's tongue with a melee weapon. You only have a fraction of a second to react and swing your weapon at the Smoker's tongue before he grabs you. While the chainsaw makes the achievement less difficult, chainsaws are a rare find.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostReconAdvancedWarfighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostReconAdvancedWarfighter">Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</a></em> has possibly the hardest achievements ever: Reach #1 on the Multiplayer leaderboards (Solo, Team, and Universal). Even if the X-Box leaderboards weren't infested with cheaters, the only way to get this is to literally <em>be the best GR:AW player in the world.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">"The Foxiest of the Hounds"</a> involves setting off zero alarms for the entire campaign; whilst this may seem simple enough through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>, note that alarms aren't always noticeable (as they sometimes only happen in a specific area as opposed to the entire base), which can mean <em>an entire campaign restart</em> if a body is found several areas back and you don't realize.
</li><li> The Missing Link DLC (which is also part of the Director's Cut) includes a high-value achievement for completing it without using any weapons (including mines or grenades) or upgrading any of your augs after the opening cutscene disables all of them. Not only is the DLC level already one of the hardest areas in the game, but the achievement is bugged so that sometimes you don't actually get it <em>even though you fulfilled the requirements.</em> Nobody is sure why this happens; the best advice anyone can offer is to avoid even <em>picking up</em> anything whose use might break the required conduct, and some accounts suggest even that isn't always enough to avoid the bug.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em> has "You can be my wingman anytime," which requires a perfect flying run (meaning you can't get hit once and every missile you launch has to make a kill). While it's not too bad since the dogfights are mostly scripted in how the bogeys launch their missiles and flares, if you mess up even once, you can't just revert to the last checkpoint. No, you have to restart the mission from the very beginning and watch the five-minute intro cutscene every time. Better get comfortable.
</li><li> In the past, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> games had the "Seriously" achievements (which necessitated grinding to get a lot of kills - 10,000 in the first game, 100,000 in the second). "Seriously 3.0" necessitates getting to Level 100 and obtaining every Onyx (special) medal - that means playing somewhere in the neighbourhood of <strong>18,000 matches</strong> to get all of them (which includes, but isn't limited to, getting 6000 executions, 4000 headshots, playing 2500 "perfect games", getting 5000 assists, 6000 kills with each weapon, etc). This can be mitigated (somewhat) by setting up private matches with bots, but it's still going to take weeks to get this legally.
<ul><li> The <em>Foreshadowing</em> achievement in the RAAM's shadow DLC: "As RAAM, execute Minh 10 times in Versus MP (Standard or Casual)." Requires random online players picking one particular character, only available if they have the DLC, out of a few dozen choices and then actually being able to down them and use a finisher on them. 10 times. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> at its best.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> has several achievements that has people wondering if Overkill wanted to push the limits of even the most hardened players. The "One Shot, One Kill - Repeat" achievement requires you to kill 30 enemies using only exactly 30 bullets with a particular weapon. While lightly armored enemies like the guards and cops can die in a single shot on Easy or possibly Normal, most of the stronger enemies are heavily armored, so you will have to do headshots for a surefire kill. 30 headshots in a row? Good luck.
<ul><li> "Noob Herder" requires everyone playing a mission on Overkill difficulty while the other players are using the Noob Lube perk. In other words, a player who is near the level cap and plays on Overkill difficulty regularly has to play with 3 other players who are brand new to the game and have them play on the highest difficulty in order to get the achievement. Players can reset their stats to get a shot at the achievement, but they lose the Noob Lube perk at level 5 and since Overkill difficulty can give people a ton of money if they are good enough, it's quite easy to level up very fast.
</li><li> "Lay On Hands" requires you to level up in the Support class while you are reviving a teammate. There's very few challenges that you can do that doesn't require your attention and you can't do anything else while you are reviving another player.
</li><li> "Are You Ready Yet?" requires players to let their companion, Bain, circle around the building during the Diamond Heist mission 7 times while playing on Overkill difficulty. Most sensible players would immediately bolt for Bain's helicopter after they steal all the diamonds instead of letting him circle around multiple times while endless swarms of cops try to kill them. After looping 7 times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Bain tells you that you got your trophy now and to get in the chopper already.</a>
</li><li> "Pacifist" requires you to complete the Counterfeit level on hard or above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">without killing a single cop or civilian.</a>
</li><li> "GL40 Special Treat" requires that you kill 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">special SWAT units</a> with a single grenade launcher shot. It's not common for special units to appear beyond 2 kinds and it's even more rare for a cluster of special units to appear close together. Not to mention that special SWAT are heavily armored.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>PAYDAY 2</em> continues the tradition of rage inducing achievements:
<ul><li> "Guessing Game" is a nightmare. On day 2 of Firestarter, you have to cut the cords connected to the alarm, but you can also do them before Bain tells you what the correct cords are. Guessing Game requires you to cut both correct cords without letting Bain finding them for you. However, there are around 10 possible cords for you to cut, in any combination (they are not spawned in sets), which result in almost a hundred different possible variations. Cut the wrong one? The alarm goes off and you lose your shot at the achievement.
</li><li> "Sewer Rats" has you moving the bags of cash through the sewers on Overkill difficulty during the GO Bank heist. The difficulty comes from having to move 8-10 bags of cash through a maze-like sewer while fighting a time limit to escape while playing on a very unforgiving difficulty level.
</li><li> "Doctor Miserable" lives up to its name; on day 2 during the Big Oil heist on Overkill, you have to send every single wrong engine to Bain until the final engine is the correct one. You have to send out 11 wrong engines (each of which is incredibly heavy and will weigh the player down) and survive wave after wave of cops waiting for the helicopter to come in for each engine. The kicker? Getting the first engine to the tarmac, including having to fight through the security first, can take <em>45 minutes by itself</em> without having to turn back for the others. There's also no indication of which engine is correct, so it's possible to accidentally complete the mission too fast.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RAGE">RAGE</a></em> grants "JACKPOT!" for scoring four kills on the first round of the Tombstones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame">Mini-Game</a>. This involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">rolling four d2s</a>, giving you 16:1 odds of getting it on any given play of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame">Mini-Game</a>. Similarly, "Hardest Deck" requires you to win the hardest difficulty level of the TCG <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGame">Mini-Game</a>, which means building a deck and hoping you picked the right cards in the right order to kill all the opponent's cards.
</li><li> One level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a> The Second Encounter</em> has a section that catapults several Kleer at you. One of the secrets in the level requires you to snipe them all out of the air before they touch the ground. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> makes it a little easier.
<ul><li> There's also the Midnight Mega Secret in the Citadel. There's two ways to get it: the easy way, which is to fire many, many rockets at a fairly innocuous door until it explodes, or speedrun as hard as you can through 3/4 of the level to get to the door when it opens for about 30 seconds.
</li><li> BFE has "Queen Hatshepsut". To gain this Achievement you need to finish the last level "The Guardian Of Time" on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">"Serious" difficulty</a>. <em>Without dying or re-loading</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">F.E.A.R.</a></em> has "Fearsome" (complete the campaign on Extreme), "No Fear" (complete all Instant Action maps on Extreme, which are <em>insanely</em> difficult on that level), "No Juice" (don't pick up any boosters), "Real Time" (don't use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a>), and "Survivalist" (complete the campaign without dying).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a> 2</em>'s Recursion stat-tracker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a>, which adds achievements for killstreaks and the like, has several achievements that require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">massive amounts of luck</a>, such as "One Man to Farm Them All", which requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">500 kills without dying</a>; only <em>four</em> people have gotten the achievement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife">Strife</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Veteran Edition</a></em> has two:
<ul><li> The "Unstoppable" achievement requires you to finish the game on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Bloodbath</a> difficulty. Not only do enemies spawn in their hard mode placements, but they're at their most aggressive, and mechanical enemies even respawn. Oh, and it also asks you to finish the game with the best ending, which is twice as long as the route for the mediocre ending. Have "fun".
</li><li> The "Hardcore Warm-up" is even worse. Basically, you have to do the same as previous, but for the "Trust No One" demo. Except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">replace the best ending route requirement</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun">6 minute time limit</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixVegas">Rainbow Six: Vegas</a> 2</em> has "Extreme Hunter" for completing all Terrorist Hunt maps on Realistic difficulty, which is quite frustrating in the later maps with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">unpredictable enemy spawns.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em>, a lot of the achievements related to each hero (or just general things), are this. They range from simple stuff, like attaching 4 <em>Pulse Bombs</em> for Tracer, to the ridiculous, like getting a scoped headshot while in midair, as Widowmaker. Most of the achievements have something related to a hero's ultimate, and another related to one of the hero's abilities.
<ul><li> For Offense: A lot of their ultimate-related achievements require 4 kills with a single ultimate use, which, for some heroes, is nearly impossible, depending on team composition or luck. Soldier: 76 will most likely need to pray that 4 squishies and/or low health enemies are in his sight, so he can kill them all with ease, since the ultimate only remains up for enough seconds to kill 2 fully healed offense/defense heroes. There's also a couple of other ridiculous skill-based achievements, which range from as easy as flashbanging an enemy mid-ult, to killing two enemies with a single deflect use.
<ul><li> Reaper's "Waste Not, Want Not" achievement requires the player to get 3 solo kill in <em>one clip</em>. In other words, the player needs to kill 3 full-health enemies with only 8 shots. Made even harder with the patch in May 2017, which made it so Reaper automatically reloads once he enters Wraith Form. Getting 3 solo kills with <em>Death Blossom</em> doesn't grant this achievement, although damaging the enemy and <em>then</em> using it will count, but finding 3 full health enemies and trapping them in Death Blossom after firing 3 shots is no easy task, either.
</li><li> Sombra's Achievements deserve special mention here, since one of them requires you to hack 6 enemies at once. In other words, the entire enemy team to be bunched up enough to hack them all at once, which is quite rare, and much like Doomfist's "Cratered" achievement it all but demands Zarya's <em>Graviton Surge</em> to even have a chance. Her other achievement isn't much more forgiving, given that it requires you to hack 15 enemies without dying with a squishy character who takes about a second to do it (which feels a lot longer in combat), has a cooldown 10 times as long (8 seconds compared to 0.8 cast time), and no way of defending herself while she does it.
</li><li> Doomfist gets the dubious honor of having the perhaps most difficult achievement to date. "Cratered" requires the player to hit six enemies with a single use of his ultimate. Having the entire enemy team close together is a rarity by itself but his <em>Meteor Strike</em> is one of the slowest to execute, giving the enemy team plenty of time to scatter even before he has chosen his target area. Zarya's <em>Graviton Surge</em> is almost a requirement to achieve this and even that is far from a guarantee.
</li></ul></li><li> Defense rolls much the same way, with quad-ult kills, except for Widowmaker, who requires you to get a scoped headshot, while airborne. She automatically unscopes when you jump or is flung into the air. That being said, all the game looks for is that Widowmaker is off the ground when she gets a headshot, which means that immediately jumping after getting a scoped headshot can get you the achievement. It's telling that, when a thread was created on the game's forum that asked "Which achievment did you get completly by accident?", the overwhelming answer was this one.
</li><li> Tanks are less ultimate-related, and focus on their abilities more, like Roadhog's ability to cancel enemy ultimates with his hook or Reinhardt's shield. Except for D.Va's Ultimate, which can be really difficult, due to how most players know to run for cover now.
</li><li> Due to Supports being less about killing things, most of their achievements are more about helping the team, from Mercy's <em>Resurrect</em> to Symmetra's <em>Teleporter</em>. L&uacute;cio, Symmetra and Zenyatta are the only heroes with slightly offense-based achievements, with Zenyatta's being the harder ones, due to their (high) requirements.
<ul><li> L&uacute;cio has perhaps the worst achievement in the entire game. "The Floor is Lava" requires him to get three kills while wall-running without dying. 'Kills', not eliminations. Thus, the situation requires L&uacute;cio to be wall-running with a relatively weak enemy in his line-of-sight, and if a single teammate decides to help out and kill the enemy for you (as their job as damage-dealers entails), then good luck. At least you can push an opponent off the edge of the map and wall run as the kill is registered.
</li><li> Zenyatta's "Rapid Discord" achievement requires 4 people killed with <em>Orb of Discord</em> applied at the time of their death. The final blow can either be from Zenyatta or a teammate. Sounds easy enough, right? Well, it has to be done within <em>6 seconds</em>, meaning that if you aren't communicating with your teammates, getting this achievement almost requires the stars to align. Combine that with that fact the Zenyatta uses projectiles rather than hitscan, this means that people will likely fall just 1 kill short or 1 millisecond short of getting this achievement.
</li><li> Symmetra's "Huge Success" requires her be able to teleport <em>20</em> players in a single game. Other than the fact that each <em>Teleporter</em> can teleport up to 6 people (ignoring if it gets prematurely destroyed), this means you're <em>expected</em> to have a team incompetent enough to constantly die in order to respawn and use it at all, but also for you to be perfectly able to deal enough damage in order to build up <em>at least 4 </em>Teleporters<em> in a single game.</em> Additionally considering that <em>Teleporter</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword">very situational</a> in light of <em>Shield Generator</em>, it's no wonder why very few players have this achievement. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Players can technically get around this</a> by teleporting themselves 20 times, but not only do you still require 4 <em>Teleporters</em> in one match for it to work, you'll also likely piss off your teammates for wasting their time.
</li><li> Mercy's "Huge Rez" achievement was changed from "rezzing 4 teammates at once" to "Rezzing 4 teammates without dying". Not impossible to achieve, but since Mercy has always been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">focal target since the start of the game</a>, her new skills force her to be in the line of fire much more often now.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the general achievements are pretty simple, from winning a match, to reaching level 50. However, a couple of achievements weren't popping correctly, with one requiring you to win a capture game, on defense, with no points lost. The achievement requires the capture bar to be at zero as the match ends, which can be very luck-based, depending on how good you are at defense, along with how well the enemy team is doing. Another, is getting 50 unlocks for a single hero, most of which, you'll get from RNG-based lootboxes.
</li><li> From <em>Junkenstein's Revenge</em>:
<ul><li> "Not a Scratch" requires a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> for the door, which is easy to screw up on simply by missing a Shock-Tire or letting a Zomnic slip past.
</li><li> "Held the Door" requires a successful Legendary mode win. It borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> if the Zombardiers aren't disposed of quickly, or the Gunslinger and Alchemist don't team up to kill the bosses before they overwhelm the players.
</li><li> "Survivor" needs the players to survive 4 bonus waves on Endless mode, on Expert difficulty. What makes this so hard is not only the Expert difficulty, but the fact that on Endless bonus waves, <em>multiple</em> copies of the same boss spawn soon after the first, regardless of whether or not the previous copy was killed. The second bonus wave, which has 3 of Junkenstein's Monsters spawn, can be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, which is nothing to say about the 4th bonus wave, in which 2 Witches spawn.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em>Uprising</em>, the "Distinguished Service" achievement, which requires a successful win on Legendary difficulty. That's right, not Expert, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Legendary</a></em>. The smallest screw-up from any player on Legendary difficulty is almost guaranteed to end the game. To emphasize its difficulty, a team of pros were able to earn the achievement with <em>only 1 second left on the clock</em>. At the end of the event, when the mode's metrics were posted on the Overwatch website, <em>fewer than one percent of attempts on Legendary difficulty</em> ended in victory.

What is the achievement's conditions, exactly? Clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Area 6-15</a> in Adventure Mode. Getting to 6-15 in the first place requires you to earn all other stars in Adventure mode. Each non-boss stage has 3 stars to collect, and only by clearing the stage on Pro difficulty can all of them be collected, and while any stage on Pro is hard enough, you have to complete <em>all</em> of them on that difficulty! Meanwhile, each boss stage has 6 stars to collect, all 6 requiring collecting <em>every</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneUp">1-Up</a> and doing a no-death run in one shot. <br><br>At least the achievement with the next-lowest Steam clear rate, "Score Attack &gt; Extreme 4", only requires beating any one stage on Extreme with an S rank.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana">La-Mulana</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana2">La-Mulana 2</a></em> have achievements named "All I Need is One Arm" and "All I Need is One Finger". The condition? Defeat the big bosses of the game (known as Ankh Guardians, as well as the final boss) without using subweapons. What are subweapons? They're the game's ranged weapons, basically, one of which is a handgun that does a lot of damage. The bosses are not terribly hard with them (except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">certain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss">bosses</a>), but without them learning spacing, ability timing, knowing when it's safe to swing (as you can't cancel an attack animation once it starts), etc. become crucial since you have to land all your hits in melee range. Also the one called One Finger? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">That's specifically for hard mode. Good luck.</a> Notably, the shield subweapon that can block certain boss projectiles will not disqualify you from the achievement, but in the second game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Clay Doll Outfit</span>, while not a subweapon, <em>will</em> disqualify you as it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can fire laser beams</span>. The first game has quite possibly the two hardest ones: "Playful But Lonely" and "Running Out In The Open!", both of which require the cast to be present at the end, with the exception of swimsuit Mulbruk in the former case. Each of the members have a condition to be fulfilled to be accounted for, which will require the following: obtaining all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Sacred Orbs</a>, items, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelMapDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelMapDisplay">maps</a>, all .exe roms, using every fairy point, opening every hidden coin chest, receiving all e-mails from the Elder, defeating all guardians in Hard Mode, beating Hell Temple, and clearing the game in under 10 hours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a> and the Pirate's Curse</em> has two of these achievements for its Steam release.
<ul><li> The first requires the player to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a> "Run, Run, Rottytops!" without dying, where not only is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">Everything Trying to Kill You</a>, but you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, and you only have one chance to clear the level. If you got hit and died, you'll have to reload a save and start all over.
</li><li> The "Squid Savior" achievement, which requires you to find all 32 Heart Squids, which increase the number of Shantae's life hearts... and beat the game with all 32 sitting in your inventory, not using a single one to increase your maximum health.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HollowKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HollowKnight">Hollow Knight</a></em> has "Steel Soul" for beating the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">Final Death Mode</a>, but "Steel Heart" ups the ante further by requiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> in this mode. That means getting all the collectibles, completing all the sidequests, clearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">the White Palace</a>, and defeating all the main-game bosses <em>without dying even once</em>. (Fortunately, you <em>don't</em> have to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">The Radiance</a> for this, since that doesn't add to the in-game percentage.)
<ul><li> This achievement became somewhat easier with the release of DLC, which added an extra 12% to the game, but the achievement is still awarded at 100%, not 112%. This allows you to ignore some of the hardest sections, such as the Trial of the Fool.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlantsVsZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlantsVsZombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a></em>:There's a achievement called "Alive and Planting". Which requires you to "Survive 40 waves of pure zombie ferocity.". Pure zombies ferocity = Survival Endless. Have fun trying to get that. And don't even get started on "The Complete Zombie" from the PS3 and Vita versions,which requires 100%, including the achievement above.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KatamariDamacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/KatamariDamacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em>: Katamari Forever has "Completist", which requires you to collect every item in the game. While 100% collections can be frustrating in a lot of games, special mentions go to the items "Cowbear" and to a somewhat lesser extent, "Devil Kataoka":
<ul><li> Cowbear only exists in the "Cowbear" level, where you instantly clear (and thus leave) the level if you pick up any cow or bear-related item. First off, it's really big, so you'll need to grow to a huge size, picking up most of the other things in the level... while constantly avoiding the tiniest cow/bear items. Unlike other levels, smaller items do not disappear when you grow in size, so you might accidentally pick up something you can barely see. Secondly, it runs around the stage at a high speed, with two smaller bears running in front of and behind it... so it's recommended getting rid of them first by knocking them away when you reach the size where you're just BARELY too small to roll them up but still big enough to knock them over. Third, when you're finally at the right size to pick it up, it runs away like other living creatures. So after getting that far, you'll just have to chase forwards and pray you don't accidentally roll into that cow parasol very close to you... if you haven't already ran out of time by that point.
</li><li> As for Devil Kataoka, he only exists in "Hot Stuff", a level that's infamously annoying to even CLEAR. In this level, your katamari is a ball of fire that has to reach 10000C*, raising temperature if you pick up hot/neutral things and sinking significantly if you pick up cold things... and when you're not picking up anything, your temperature gradually drops. Dropping down to 0C* instantly makes you fail the level. Kataoka is standing in the middle of several snowmen which are almost impossible to avoid (not to mention, close to the river which will make you fail the level if you fall into it), and he's also so big you have to make sure to grow slowly so you don't reach 10000C* before you're big enough... And even if you get this far, you'll still have to beat the level to keep what you rolled up, which can be pretty hard since there will most likely be very few non-cold items left at this point. The trick here, which can still be a pain, is to grow even bigger, then pick up the Sacred Torch (another level-exclusive item) which instantly gives you the 10000C* you need to beat the level.
</li><li> There's also "Enormous Katamari", which requires you to make a Katamari over 2,000,000km, which is only possible in the last stage where you roll up the planets in space. The issue here is that you need enough stuff floating around in space in the first place to be able to grow big enough! You'll need to make the other planets on ALL modes for all the levels, collect enough Stardust and shooting stars... and even then you have to make sure to grow slow enough and go for the smaller things first so they don't disappear before you collect them.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MMO&nbsp;</div><div id="folder9" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A meta-achievement in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> requires a character to max out 30 title tracks. There are about 40 potential tracks to max, but only 31 of these (two of which are mutually exclusive) are character-specific; the rest are account-wide and much more time-consuming to obtain. Most folks, therefore, will aim to complete all the character-based titles... which would be fine, were it not for <em>Survivor</em>. Survivor requires a character to gain 1,337,500xp without dying, which instantly resets the counter to 0. This was even worse when initially introduced as characters who died would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">permanently unable to gain the title</a>.
<ul><li> Honorable mention goes to the Legendary Defender of Ascalon achievement. The only reason Arenanet isn't on trial for crimes against humanity for that one is that they only put in the achievement after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">some players had already done so</a>. It is the notorious achievement of reaching the level-cap in the tutorial area of the original game. Prior to the developers patching in daily quests that spawned level-appropriate enemies, the mobs in this area were too low level for players to gain experience after a certain point. To counter this players had to drag high level enemies to a respawn shrine and get killed there and respawn, only to get killed again and again. This would effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">Level Grind</a> the mobs to a point where they could be killed for a few measly XP. And then you have to do it over and over again, with estimated gameplay time ranging towards 50 hours.
</li><li> The original version of the Drunkard title was ridiculous as it required the player be drunk for <em>10,000 minutes</em>, or nearly an entire <em>week</em>. And not just mildly tipsy, but at a a specific "tier" of inebriation which was high enough that actual play would be very difficult. Players after the title had to carefully space out their drinks to keep the buzz going at just the right level and eventually resorted to bizarre cheating methods, like going through a zone portal to reset the drunk level without taking a drink. Eventually Arenanet decided the system was too punishing and set the title to require 10,000 <em>points</em>, with each type of booze being worth 1 or more points immediately.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>, aside from the Trophies that are now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">impossible to obtain</a> (be there for the rollout of ascension, beat up 10 reindeer) there is also 'Septuple Platinum," record all 7 possible Accordion Thief buffs at a special location. The problem comes from the songs themselves. 5 are obtained from Hobopolis, which requires your clan to go there and let you get the songs; one comes from underwater, a place that is intended for players that are too strong for the rest of the Kingdom; and one that you need to get from the Travelling Trader, who no longer sells them. While it is possible to get this trophy now, it will take a lot of resources.
<ul><li> "Bouquet of Hippies" and "Awwww, Yeah". The first one requires eating 420 herb brownies, while the second on requires killing 240 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster">Black Puddings</a>, which have a 1/3 chance of being alive when you try to eat them. Given the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">Anti Poop-Socking</a> method of limiting how much you can eat per day, those are likely to take 60 days and 90 days respectively. Hope you like eating lots and lots of crappy foods!
</li><li> "Moving Target", unlocked by obtaining 12-sided dice (if you attended a real-life <em>KoL</em> con or do business with someone who did, you can slowly summon them; otherwise, they'll need to be bought from other players) and using multiples of them, and by rolling a number <em>exactly</em> one higher than that of <em>the last person who got the trophy</em>. This isn't that hard <em>yet</em>, but give it a few years...
</li></ul></li><li> This is starting to crop up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>. Several of the "Kill" accolades involve defeating up to 1,000 members of each enemy faction; the problem is that while some are very easy due to the existence of Fleet actions, where the ground is covered in hundreds of enemies at a time, several of the factions only appear in 2 or 3 missions. The best mission to hunt Nausicaans only has 25 enemies, and it's the only mission you can choose, meaning it has to be replayed about 40 times! This isn't even getting into cases where the enemies appear to be a member of the faction, but won't actually count towards the Accolade (looking at you, Kuvah'magh mission). Combine this with the fact that most players have a... distaste for ground combat, and you hear a lot of complaints. On the "Space" side of the accolades, there's the "Breen Capital Punishment" one, which requires you to, naturally, defeat 3 Breen Capital ships. The problem here is that the ships spawn very, very rarely, and typically wander through the maps far outside the mission area in each Daily's location. Keep in mind these are SPACE missions, which means that it's hard to tell exactly where you are in the map (Space is mostly empty, after all.) and so you could easily waste a lot of time wandering around looking for something that's not there. Since, unlike the other missions, this one can only be done once a day, this is the worst combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> and forced waiting in the game. The only upside is that missions are instanced, so there's no chance of anyone interfering in the kills.
<ul><li> In another Cryptic Studios game based on the same engine, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em>, there are 100, 1000 and 5000 kill achievements. Some are extremely easy to do (VIPER) as you encounter them throughout your heroic career from 1-40 and/or are regular end game enemies. All it takes is a bit of grinding. Other groups which no longer appear, even in Alerts (the Westside gangs with the exception of the Red Banner, who does show up in Alerts) can take much longer to grind. Nothing, however, prepares someone for 5000 Empyrean Constructs kills. Not seen in missions nor in Alerts, they are barely grouped together and at best, Lemuria (the map where you find them) will contain around 25 in the entire map.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> gives us "What a Long Strange Trip it's Been" a meta achievement for completing all the achievements for the in game Holidays. Most of which involve at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> and are only available for a few weeks before being gone till the next year. And with no guarantee that you'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis">playing the same class</a> for the whole year, this one slips through a lot of people's fingers over and over again.
<ul><li> Some of the luck based missions have since been removed as requirements for the events, such as the requirement to get a black dress in Love is in the Air, but "School of Hard Knocks" is not only quite difficult for people who don't PvP often (the other PvP-based holiday achievements only require honorable kills, which do not require the achievement seeker to get the killing blow), but also results in battlegrounds being full of people who want the achievement and who don't know how to PvP, thus angering many regular PVPers.
</li><li> "Veteran Nanny" is another Holiday achievement. The reason it's here is not because it requires you to do something hard, or RNG-reliant - it's because this achievement requires a minimum of <em>two real-life</em> <em><strong>YEARS</strong></em> to get.
</li><li> Prior to Cataclysm, the "Loremaster" achievements for Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms fell under this. These required completing an arbitrary number of quests on the respective continents but only listed progress. Without quest tracking on individual zones, there was no way to tell which areas had incomplete quests short of running code checks for quest completion or personally checking every possible quest-giver and/or dropper. Without flying mounts, this could literally take hours and you could still miss quests.
</li><li> "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" was generally reviled for the quest requiring you collect pages which were a random drop off any mob randomly. As they each had a specific page number and could drop multiple times, it could take weeks to farm the pages yourself and other players would charge exorbitant amounts for the least common pages.
</li><li> Herald of the Titans requires that players defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Algalon the Observer</a> in Ulduar <em>without any gear that is higher level than what is available in the <strong>10 man</strong> version of Ulduar</em>. Not only is this quite difficult on its own, but it's also impossible to outgear, and virtually impossible to find people who are willing to do it.
<ul><li> In theory, level 85s could have gone back and done it with the basic crafted gear, but unlike a lot of other achievements, Blizzard preserved this one by making it unobtainable by level 81+ characters.
</li></ul></li><li> Cataclysm also gives us an achievement so insanely difficult to obtain, guilds have been pulling their hair out over it for months: "I Can't Hear You Over the Sound of How Awesome I Am". The criteria? Beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Sinestra.</a> On your first try. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCasualtiesRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCasualtiesRun">With not a single death at any point in the battle.</a> If someone has earned this, props are very much deserved.
<ul><li> Like the Algalon achievement, it would be much easier to accomplish during the next expansion with level 86+ characters, but unlike "Herald of the Titans", Blizzard blocked this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">removing the achievement</a>, and making it a Feat of Strength for the people who completed it during Cataclysm.
</li></ul></li><li> "Headed South" is considered one of the most difficult Cataclysm dungeon achievements. You need three stacks of a debuff on you at the time of Siamat's death, but 1) The buff is collected from adds in the first phase and Siamat only takes full damage in the second; even with the trick, you need high DPS, 2) The debuff also increases damage taken, and thus the strain on the healer, and 3) Only the people with three stacks get it; if a group is having trouble with 2), they might have to decide who gets it.
</li><li> "We Had It All Along" is at least the hardest of the PvP achievements, if not the hardest of them all. This achievement requires you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">win an Arathi Basin match by exactly ten points</a>. Even if the enemy team was somehow conspiring with you to help you get the achievement, it'd still require you to do some math to figure out exactly how many points to hold for how long. The only reliable strategy for getting this is to play Arathi Basin over and over and over until it eventually happens by sheer dumb luck.
</li><li> "Gonna Need A Bigger Bag" requires the player to collect the rare drops off every mob and rare spawn on Timeless Isle. In total it amounts to <em>57 items</em>, many with drop rates estimated around 1%. Most rare mobs spawn in a small timeframe about an hour after being killed, but a handful have highly irregular spawn times that can cover hours or even <em>days</em>. One rare in particular spawns only once or twice a week and one of its items has a 1% drop rate. The final insult of the achievement was that it came on the heels of an expansion rife with fun toy items, meaning many players lacked the space to store these additional items.
</li><li> <em>Wrath of the Lich King's</em> "Frostbitten", earned by finding and killing every rare spawn on Northrend, is a rare instance of an achievement that manages to infuriate both the people doing it <em>and</em> some people who aren't. For those looking to earn it, it's a pain in the neck because it requires you to hunt down and kill specific mobs that have respawn timers ranging from hours to <em>days</em>, and only one player can claim the kill for each spawn. In addition to this, however, no less than three of the achievement's required mobs are rare beasts with unique looks that are extremely sought after by hunters looking to tame them, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantheraAwesome">Loque'nahak</a> in particular possessing both a unique model and being the <em>only</em> Spirit Beast in the game when it was introduced. Due to this, "Frostbitten" isn't particularly well-liked among hunters in general.
<ul><li> The achievement was later adjusted so that <em>taming</em> Loque'nahak counted. This did not change the fact that his long spawn time, many spawn locations, and popularity mean he is <em>still</em> near impossible for somebody to obtain without camping.
</li></ul></li><li> "Scourer of the Eternal Sands" is the reward for finding a special camel figurine and completing a small event. There are just a few problems, though. First, the figurine is on a long spawn timer and there's no way to know if it has spawned without checking. Second, the figurine is small and easily missed while checking quickly. Third, it has dozens of spawn points scattered across one of the larger zones in the game and only one will ever be active at once. And fourth, only one in ten figurines that spawn actually trigger the event; otherwise they drop some vendor trash and the spawn timer resets.
</li><li> "Rumble Club" in the <em>Legion</em> iteration of the Brawler's Club is not too difficult except for one event: The Stranglethorn Streak. Players are stripped of their armor and artificially reduced to level 1 and must survive for two minutes while surrounded by mobs that will one-shot and all have different patterns. The mobs are constantly spawning and despawning and there's no guarantee they won't spawn on a player's location and insta-kill them. All of this is made worse by the fact that <em>every player in the queue</em> is forced into this Rumble and the majority, if not entirety of them, will die and lose any buffs they had. Griefers buy this card to harass others and even people who are legitimately trying for the achievement are accused of griefing.
</li><li> "Insane in the Membrane" is a tribute to dedicated players from vanilla who ground up reputations to Exalted for fringe factions that didn't really matter.
<ul><li> The Shen'dralar was a small faction in the Dire Maul dungeon whose only quests for reputation required a ridiculous investment of time and resources. Each quest required a rare gem only dropped by level 60 elite mobs; two difficult to acquire crafting materials from level 60 zones; and a libram found in Dire Maul wings at an average of 1 per dungeon. That meant at least <em>84 dungeon runs</em> if every libram drop went to you. The faction was later removed, as was the requirement.
</li><li> The Darkmoon Faire in its original incarnation only awarded reputation for handing in trash items looted from different types of mobs across the game world. Between the low drop rate and lack of reward for actually completing these quests, most people chose simply to sell these items. The Faire's revamp in later expansions vastly reduced the grind.
</li><li> Players can reach Revered with Ravenholdt by farming low-level mobs in the neighboring zone, but after the cut-off there's only one option: Heavy Junkboxes. These are pickpocketed by rogues from max level humanoid mobs, and five can be turned in to Ravenholdt for a tiny bit of reputation. In total it takes a minimum of <em>1,405</em> junkboxes to reach Exalted. And for a little extra annoyance, they don't stack in your inventory so they have to be handed in in batches while the player runs to the nearest mailbox to get more.
</li><li> Honored with the Bloodsail Pirates and Exalted with the Steamwheedle Cartel were interconnected goals. The only way to increase reputation with the Bloodsail was by killing members of the Cartel, which would in turn reduce their reputation. The easiest way to accomplish this was to get one reputation to the required level before tanking them to get the other where it was needed. This was a tedious grind both directions, especially as the Cartel mobs were often able to easily kill players.
</li></ul></li><li> "Hero of Shattrath" is similar to the Bloodsail and Cartel mentioned above. A player must first get Exalted with one reputation and then the other - but by the time a player reaches Exalted with one, the other will be at the lowest level of Hated. The only way to restore the other faction to a level where it was possible to do regular quests was by farming a certain animal drop (basilisk eyes or spider venom sacs) in Terokkar Forest. Without reputation buffs, it takes <em>1,344</em> of the required item to reach Neutral. And if that wasn't enough, the drop rate is roughly 33%, meaning that without buying these from other players you would need to kill in the neighborhood of <strong>4,000</strong> of a low-level trash mob. And that's before doing the normal reputation grind from Neutral to Exalted!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSNAKEMAN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSNAKEMAN">Billy vs. SNAKEMAN</a></em> has a couple contenders among its Trophies. "Scrapbook Hero" requires you to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Candy</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode">ween</a> <em>six times</em>. To get "Let It Ride", you bet a valuable item on <em>1:36 odds</em> and win. For "Tiny Three", you need three different variants of a very infrequently found item. "Enough Already" takes a month of Season grinding <em>beyond</em> what has any other purpose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> has the Quest Specialist Medal, which gives a higher stat bonus than any other medals with the exception of ones that come from events, but it requires you to complete 800 quests. Each step in multi-step quests counts towards the goal, so it's not as bad as it could be, but many of them are long and would mean slowing down your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaTale">La Tale</a></em> has DotNuri, a mini-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, except with any feature that might make your life any easier being removed. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a>, Super Mushrooms or Checkpoints for you, and just touching any enemy sends you to the start of the level! When you combine the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> with the fact that all the enemies move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">completely randomly</a> it makes even the easiest level nigh impossible for most people. And then if you do somehow manage to finish it, guess what? You need to do each stage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">twenty times</a> to get its bonus! The prizes themselves range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsAward">a useless title</a> to a permanent critical rate boost, but good luck running across anybody who's actually won those prizes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiralKnights">Spiral Knights</a></em> has "Dauntless Delver" (go from depths 0-29 without dying). This is made easier if simply run through the optional areas of the levels, but still requires a considerable chunk of time and skill to beat. So basically, you're running through 26 levels filled to the brim with things trying to kill you, unable to revive or even use the Emergency Revive provided when falling for the first time on that level. There was an achievement awarded for depositing a total of 10,000 minerals, but this is now unobtainable since the removal of mineral depositing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>
<ul><li> Probably the worst achievement in the entire game is "How Many Games?", which requires the player to play the Castle Wars minigame for an insanely long time to collect every piece of profound decorative armour. Even with boosters it takes several days of playing the minigame game constantly to complete. The minimum amount of time it could possibly take is about 300 hours and it will likely take much longer. This achievement is so frustrating to get that it was removed from the requirements to get the trimmed completionist cape during a rework because it alone severely restricted the number of players that could get it.
</li><li> The "Up to the Gods" achievement. Requires sacrificing Frost Dragon bones on an altar, in a solo dungeon. The Frost Dragon is a very rare beast that only appears on the 11 easiest floors (giving the lowest experience per floor) and is incredibly rare (maybe once in 500 rooms). There have been reports of people playing over 70 dungeons without finding a single one. What makes this worse is that it is classified as a "medium" difficulty achievement, and is required to unlock rewards.
</li><li> The Elite Task "Xena-phile" is even worse. To complete it, you have to obtain an attuned weapon seed, an extremely rare drop (1/10,000), and turn it into a weapon that can disappear after being used once. The devs did make the attuned weapon seed a guaranteed drop after the update, but it was only guaranteed for one elf kill, was hard to see, was not announced and some players experienced disconnections after killing the seed dropping elf. What makes it worse is that this guaranteed drop was not announced and several tasks in the lower sets require you to kill an elf. Some people managed to complete the task when it was glitched, and Jagex later made it so Lady Ithell would provide a free attuned weapon seed if the player had yet to do the task.
</li><li> The Hard Daemonheim task "Kinprovements". Wear a Ring of Kinship with a fully upgraded role. Upgrading rings costs dungeoneering tokens, and while it starts out costing a pittance, the costs rapidly jump to obscene levels, with the final role upgrade costing a ludicrous <em>233,000</em> tokens. For reference, if you start at level 1 Dungeoneering and never spend tokens on anything but upgrading your chosen role, by the time you complete this achievement, your Dungeoneering skill will be in <em>the low eighties</em>. Essentially, this achievement is nothing but a huge grind.
</li><li> Another Daemonheim task, "And I Want It Now!", requires you to complete a complexity 6 solo floor in 6 minutes or less. This boils down to nothing more than praying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> smiles on you and lets you find the boss door early - and doesn't give you one of the bosses that turns invincible or throws you around the boss room.
</li><li> If you're going for the Trimmed Completionist Cape, you'll hate anything related to the Champion's Challenge. Certain types of monsters have a very, very small chance to drop a challenge scroll, which lets you fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook">King Mook</a> in the Champion's Guild. The drop rate is <em>1/5000</em>, and you have to collect <em>thirteen</em> of them to complete the achievement. There's a way to increase the drop rate...to a whopping <em>1.2/5000</em>, and you can only get it from the Motherlode Maw. There are people that have played the game for over a decade without seeing a single scroll.
</li><li> <em>Old School Runescape</em> has a few particularly irritating ones. One of the achievements for the elite Western Provinces Diary requires you to claim a chompy hat after killing 1,000 chompy birds. This requires several hours of very, very repetitive chompy bird grinding.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> had the Avoids the Green Stuff badge. To get this badge, a group of 12-24 people had to defeat a boss while never once being caught in his orbital strike, which he used every 30 seconds. If even one character got caught only once, the entire group didn't get the badge. And the boss had an area hold that, with a little bit of poor timing or bad luck, could result in characters being unable to move when the orbital strike hit.
<ul><li> The badges for Damage Taken, Debt Paid Off, Damage Healed, Time Held, and Influence Earned were all a massive grind to earn, to the point that the devs ended up drastically reducing the requirements for them, in most cases by an order of magnitude. The final damage healed badge (Empath) was the worst offender and was actually reduced by two orders of magnitude (from 1 billion to 10 million).
</li><li> One badge, for defeating 100 Infected, was easy to get for a character <em>if</em> the player went through the tutorial mission and hung around the tutorial minizone fighting Infected before heading off to the main game. It was easy to do solo, and if a group teamed up could easily be completed in a few minutes. If the player didn't get it in the tutorial, or if they skipped the tutorial entirely, the only Infected who appeared in the regular city zones was a single Infected who appeared at intervals in the Atlas Park transit station, which meant that a player would have to be there when it appeared and get it before someone else hunting the badge defeated it first (or a high level player randomly one-shotted it in passing). And do it 100 times. It did eventually become easier: The introduction of time-travel organization Ouroboros included a flashback to the tutorial zone with enough of the Infected to get the badge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> have certain Epic Medals which the player can receive on certain conditions. The medal that fits this trope most: the illusive "Raisenai Heroes" medal - for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">killing virtually the entire enemy team of 15 (just having 14 kills is enough for the said medal) in a single battle.</a>
<ul><li> While Epic medals such as Raisenai Heroes, Radley-Walters or Poole's Medal are challenging due to the number of enemies having to be killed in a single match, having a good tank with a trained crew facing a group of complete idiots on the other team can make it easier. Fadin's Medal, although only needing a single kill to make, can be more challenging because it requires a player to destroy the last tank on the enemy team with the very last shell the player has loaded: it is very much luck-based because it's entirely possible for the last shell to not <em>quite</em> do enough damage to make the kill, another on the team could easily get the last enemy first, or the enemy tank could have enough health and the combination of armour on the enemy and power of the player's gun that makes it impossible to make the kill with a single shot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em> also has a couple of achievements that can qualify. "Die Hard" requires a player to destroy an enemy ship by ramming and survive. Getting up close for a ram is a challenge since the enemy can easily kill you with their shells and torpedoes at point blank range. Not only that, but ramming will cause your ship to take a significant amount of damage as well. But the achievement that fits this trope the most is "Solo Warrior" which requires a player to stand alone against 4 enemy ships and win the battle. If you ever do find yourself in such a situation, your team is most likely losing by a lot, and often the only way to come back and win is to square off against the four enemy ships by yourself and sink them all. Yeah...good luck with that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusClash">Nexus Clash</a></em> has never been achieved by anyone in the series' entire run, and part of why that's so is because of how unlikely it is that one character will have gotten the final achievement badges for killing sufficiently large numbers of both Angels and Demons. Getting even one such badge is an achievement in and of itself, since it requires hunting down hundreds of examples of specific classes of player characters in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PVPBalanced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PVPBalanced">PVP Balanced</a> setting. There are players who have the badges, but still don't have 100% completion yet.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinball&nbsp;</div><div id="folder10" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePinballArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePinballArcade">The Pinball Arcade</a></em> replicates existing machines into a digital form, and for each there are five Table Goals and five Wizard Goals. The Wizard Goals are all this to one extent or another, meant for people who have mastered the tables. A few of the Table Goals, however, will elude even wizards:
<ul><li> "Activate Harem Multi-Ball" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TalesOfTheArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TalesOfTheArabianNights">Tales of the Arabian Nights</a></em>. This was not intended to be that elusive, but it is. To reach Harem Multi-Ball, you have to shoot the left orbit 5 times when no mode is going on. However, every single mode in the game changes the purpose of the left orbit to either something directly related to the goal (like "The Tale of the Rukh") or to Tiger Loops (like "Genie Hurry-Up"). Because of how easy it is to start modes even purely by accident, how modes of different categories stack, and how the left orbit is one of the more difficult shots in the game, you can very easily reach the final modes in the game without ever coming close to activating Harem Multi-Ball.
</li><li> "Increase the Timer to 180 seconds" on <em>Goin' Nuts</em>. At the beginning of a ball, the timer begins at 10 seconds suspended, and you're given a 3-ball multiball. Completing a set of 3 targets of the same color adds 3 seconds, and once you're down to two balls, they add 2 seconds. When you're down to one ball, however, this timer starts ticking down in real time, and the flippers freeze once the timer hits zero, ending the ball. Also, targets no longer add time. Even if you never lose a ball in the meantime, you still have to complete a set of 3 same-color targets <em>57 times</em> in one go to get this Table Goal. Losing one ball will increase that number up to 85 times in one go.
<ul><li> This 180-second challenge is one of the <em>Standard</em> Goals. After unlocking the Wizard Goals for <em>Goin' Nuts</em>, the target jumps up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">360 seconds</a></em>!
</li></ul></li><li> As for the Wizard Goals, there are also a few that stand out among even them for having a very low number of people who have pulled them off. They include:
<ul><li> "Reach Atlantis" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RipleysBelieveItOrNot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RipleysBelieveItOrNot">Ripley's Believe It or Not!</a></em>. To do this, you must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellingBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellingBonus">spell out "Ripleys,"</a> and each letter is a <em>massive</em> ordeal. Letters are sometimes given out as rare random awards, but you're supposed to get them, one by one, completing missions. <em>Ripley's Believe It Or Not!</em> has 7 missions, one for each continent, that requires you do a rather long series of specific shots, either on a strict timer or as a multiball where going down to one ball ends the mission as a failure. Good luck completing enough missions to finish spelling "Ripleys." There is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">some solace</a> in how once every continent has been played, they can be played again and completing a continent's mission again gets you another letter, but this assumes you have lasted long enough to cycle through the continents multiple times.
</li><li> "Get 3 Extra Balls" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Genie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Genie">Genie</a></em>. <em>Genie</em> provides only one Extra Ball per ball. This Wizard Goal thus asks not only very good play, but <em>consistently</em> very good play, because the large amount of trouble needed to get an Extra Ball must be accomplished through three different balls.
</li><li> "Obtain All 26 Magic Tokens" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker">Safe Cracker</a></em>. To get a Magic Token, you have to reach the bank's vault. Getting there requires some effort, but it's not <em>that</em> hard. The problem here lies in how Magic Tokens are awarded randomly among the 26 available designs, making it a completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>. Unless you're very lucky, you'll likely get a lot of duplicate Magic Tokens along the way.
</li><li> "Save 175 Lives" on <em>Rescue 911</em>. There are many ways to save Lives in this game, but it says something about this Wizard Goal's difficulty that "Super Life Force," the very last mode in the game, becomes available at only (relatively speaking) 120 Lives.
</li><li> "Activate Lyman's Lament" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash">Monster Bash</a></em>. Lyman's Lament is a secret feature in the table which was never supposed to be activated. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatCode">Cheat Code</a> to begin the game with "Lyman's Lament" activated, but this Wizard Goal is awarded only through the "normal" way: shooting the Concert Hall Scoop 44 times in one game. You have to completely focus on that scoop and hope the scoop never shoves the ball straight down the drain on the way out.
</li><li> "Activate Spider Mania" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/ScaredStiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/ScaredStiff">Scared Stiff</a></em>. To reach it, you have to get the spinner to land on every space at least once. There are 16 such spaces, and the timing is very tight if you want something specific. It is so difficult that experienced players will give this game two difficulty ratings: One for the main game and a much higher one for if you're also going for "Spider Mania."

<ul><li> In the same game, there's "Greased Lightning", earned by beating Green Hill Act 1 in under a minute. Not only does a typical player usually end up with at least about 1:30.00, but since the physics of this game aren't the same as the original Sonic the Hedgehog, be prepared to start over and over and over from missing one jump due to either a glitch, or the game's movements not responding until half a second after the button input.
</li><li> Some of the red rings are <em>ridiculously</em> hard to get (the first one in City Escape act 2 comes to mind)
</li></ul></li><li> Following the tradition of <em>Sonic</em> games giving achievements for not taking a hit during a boss battle, we have the 2011 re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em>, in which you can get an achievement for beating Metal Sonic without being hit once. Good luck.
</li><li> The 2012 rerelease of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> has "Emblem Mania" and "You Are The Legend", unlocked by collecting all 180 emblems and getting A-ranks in all stages, respectively. Good luck with that. (It's also impossible to collect all the emblems without buying the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>, so be prepared to cough up your money.)
</li><li> The Steam release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a> DX</em> (in which achievements were added some time after the game was originally released) has "Metal Sonic" and "The Perfect Adventurer", both obtained by collecting all 130 emblems, and "Mission All Acomplished", obtained by completing all 60 missions. Even though there are less emblems, it's harder to collect all of them, as some of them are obtained in Adventure Fields (and there is an achievement for getting just those emblems). Plus, some missions can become insanely hard, requiring you to perform actions within Action Stages and not just in the Adventure Fields (and some missions can only be completed with a specific character).
<ul><li> Also there's "Metal Sonic Master", unlocked by getting Level A on all Action Stages using Metal Sonic. This is essentially playing through all of Sonic's stages three more times. Had trouble getting Level A on all of Sonic's stages? Well, get ready to do it all over again!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em> has the Mr. Perfect achievement. You may be good; but are you good enough to beat the entire game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">without taking a single hit</a>? While <em>9's</em> is not needed for 200 gamerscore, <em>10's</em> isn't. <em>10</em> has almost no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>, has more shit flying across every screen, and has longer levels. Lots of luck with that one. <em>10</em> does however, feature an Easy Mode difficulty, which simplifies enemy and boss patterns, and lets you save in-between Wily Castle levels, but you still have to do an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> and the two phase Wily Machine following it in one run in the second to last level.
</li><li> To unlock two minigames in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero3">Mega Man Zero 3</a></em>, you're required to not only beat every level with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">S rank</a>, but to do it with a perfect 100 score. This means you must complete every subobjective, beat levels quickly, kill a minimum amount of enemies and take no more than a small amount of damage. Luckily you're allowed to save and use the Ultimate difficulty, but it's still a taxing challenge.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyMassAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyMassAttack">Kirby Mass Attack</a></em>, there are many achievements that qualify for this, but none are more difficult the Gold Star Champion achievement which you get by getting a gold star from every level and boss, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">which means beating every level and boss without taking any damage.</a> This is downright cruel on some areas and bosses, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">and then you reach level 4-9</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">and realize how sadistic the creators of this game really are.</a></span>
</li><li> <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeatBoy">Meat Boy</a></em> has the "Girl Boy" achievement. To get this, you have to complete every Cotton Alley (which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Brutal Bonus Chapter</a> and can take more than a thousand tries to complete it) level in a row without dying. Then there's "Impossible Boy," which requires you to beat every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld">Dark Cotton Alley</a> level in a row without dying. The Dark variations of levels are much harder than the Light World ones. <strong>0.6%</strong> of all <em>Super Meat Boy</em> players have these two achievements.
<ul><li> For those who don't know the game: this is a game that is only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">challenge gamers in first place</a>, and the levels in question are much more difficult than the normal game. Only 1.1% of players even manage to beat the dark world of Cotton Alley at all, let alone without dying.
</li><li> <em>Super Meat Boy</em> has a challenge like this for every section of the game; almost all of them are extremely rare achievements, with only <em>Wood Boy</em> (beating every level of the first zone of the game without dying, in one go) having above a 1.1% completion rate. As you have to do this for literally every one of the worlds in the game, it is an extraordinarily difficult achievement. Indeed, <em>Super Meat Boy</em> is full of achievements like this; of the game's 48 achievements, only 5 of them have above a 10% completion rate, and only 10 (including those 5) above 5%. The achievement for just <em>beating the game</em> (and only the light world version of the game at that) is achieved by a mere 5.4% of players; it goes downhill from there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheyBleedPixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheyBleedPixels">They Bleed Pixels</a></em> has quite a few of these. 'Elder God' requires that you S Rank every level, which requires memorization and a full understanding of the game's combat system. There's also 'The Girl Who Would Not Die', which asks that you beat every level without dying (not in a row, thankfully): in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">this game</a>, that's asking a lot. On a more mundane note, there's 'The Lance', which requires you to kill four Blade Imps with one drop attack. Considering how quick they move and jump around, it's more luck than anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em>:
<ul><li> The HD version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2002">the original game</a> has "Bolt Collector", which requires you to collect one million bolts. Bolts are <em>much</em> harder to come by in the original game; you're not paid for completing minigames, you can't get gigantic bonuses on subsequent playthroughs due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">Challenge Mode</a> only giving you a 2x multiplier rather than an incrementing multiplier, and the value of bolts in general is much lower. Even if you get enough bolts to buy all the weapons (you <em>can</em> do that; you don't need 1,000,000 bolts at once), you'll still be 400,000 or so below the target, so this effectively means another two playthroughs just to get the bolts you need for that one trophy.
</li><li> The "Old Skool" skill point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em> has been getting this reputation, but probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">for the wrong reasons.</a> It's a pretty tricky skill point in and of itself: requiring you to kill every enemy on Dobbo using only <em>Ratchet and Clank 1</em> weapons (the Bomb Glove, Decoy Glove, Walloper, Tesla Claw, Visibomb Gun, and Omniwrench), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">which are much weaker compared to the new</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">Going Commando</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">ones, and can't be upgraded.</a> But to add insult to injury, the skill point is glitched in the HD re-release, meaning it mightn't show up even if you do everything right!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a></em> has the "Everybody Dance Now" Skill Point. To earn this one, you need to make every type of enemy, NPC, and boss dance using the Groovitron. <em>Every single one of them.</em> No progress on the Skill Point is tracked, there are a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey">similar enemies</a> that count individually, and remember that this includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">bosses and NPCs that only appear once or twice</a>. And don't forget that the six types of penguins created by the Transmorpher count for the Skill Point. On top of that, the Groovitron only holds three charges at once and they can only be bought from special vendors or by destroying Raritanium crates. Sure you can buy the Golden Groovitron, which has infinite ammo, in Challenge Mode... for <em>2 million Raritanium.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack In Time</a></em> has the "My Blaster Runs Really, Really Hot" trophy, which requires the player to get 10,000 points in the arcade game. Far harder than it sounds, but easily exploitable when you find out that playing it with two people combines your score, so you only need to get a total of 10,000 points between the two of you. Which is, of course, a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, since that's not mentioned <em>anywhere</em> in the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)</a></em> has three trophies:
<ul><li> "Faster than a Speeding Amoeboid" and "Kalebo Thunder" require you to complete the Gold Cup hoverboard races under a certain time. The harsh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI">Rubber-Band A.I.</a> and having to finish first as well makes these trophies feel luck-based.
</li><li> In addition, there's "Death by Disco", which is like the aforementioned "Everybody Dance Now", only it's limited to enemies. Hope you have the patience to replay the entire game repeatedly just for this if you happen to miss any of the missable enemies required for the trophy like the glow slugs and train tentacles. Bosses must be hit too. To top it off it's only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddingInsulttoInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddingInsulttoInjury">Bronze</a> trophy despite requiring 48 specific enemies to be hit with the Groovitron in a single Challenge Mode playthrough.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretAgentClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretAgentClank">Secret Agent Clank</a></em> has some of the hardest Skill Points to obtain in the series.
<ul><li> "Triple Platinum Record" and "Perfect Tango" require beating the first two rhythm minigames without messing up, which is extraordinarily difficult because the timing is very precise and the segments are <em>very</em> long.
</li><li> "Lucky Sevens" requires you to finish the third rhythm minigame with <strong>exactly</strong> 77,700 points, which requires you to very carefully manage your score count (not too low, not too high).
</li><li> "Deadly Hands" requires you to kill all of the Kingpin's guards during the Rionosis stealth sequence before he reaches the fourth cart, which requires some very fast stealth-killing and distractions.
</li><li> "Magnum Opus" and "Sold Out" require completing Qwark's opera segment without taking damage and earning a very high score, respectively. The segment is also quite long, and while you can get hit once and still earn "Sold Out," it requires a lot of special kills.
</li><li> "Revenant" requires you to kill every enemy in the salvage yard segment of the Spaceship Graveyard without being detected, which requires a lot of planning and luck.
</li><li> "Perfect Mirror" requires that, during Qwark's dam defense segment, the dam <em>never</em> springs a leak. This segment, like every other, is extremely long and the enemies will very easily destroy the dam.
</li><li> While most of these achievements might be easier to obtain in Challenge Mode, when you have better weapons and more knowledge of the game, "Mix Maxing" is <em>not</em>. In fact, it is <em>far</em> harder on Challenge Mode. While normally the Skill Point requires earning 1,075 points during the Giant Clank segment, which is doable, in Challenge Mode the requirement is bumped up to a whopping <em>1,550</em> points. There's not much room for error in Challenge Mode on this one.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, "The Perfect Run" is an achievement where you have to cross an entire area full of mines and Bullet Bills by having Yoshi grab onto some flowers with his tongue, turn several blue tiles yellow without being hit by any lasers, cross an electric maze with the Cloud Flower, cross an entire path full of tiles that either flip back and forth or disappear while dodging enemies that fire either lasers or coconuts, cross another electric maze (only this time with the pull stars), and finally past these Hammer Bros. and kill the Boomerang Bros. at the end to beat the game, all with only one health point and no checkpoints!
</li><li> Special 8-Crown of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DLand">Super Mario 3D Land</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Brutal Bonus Level</a> that follows in the likes of The Perfect Run from <em>Galaxy 2</em>. You are allowed to take more than one hit, but it still contains tricky platforming, a giant Cosmic Clone, and a fight against Boom Boom and Pom Pom at the same time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">Checkpoint Starvation</a> is also in full effect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakIIRenegade">Jak II: Renegade</a></em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Jak and Daxter Collection</a>, "The Collectationator!" is a really nasty one, as it requires you to collect all 286 of the game's Precursor Orbs. This means that you not only have to complete a host of sidequests, many of which could qualify as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">That One Sidequest</a> with a helping of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> for dessert, but you also have to find the 94 orbs just sitting out in the open in the various areas around the city. There's no way in-game to tell exactly which of these 94 orbs you haven't found yet, so you may need to revisit every area, some of which are a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> to revisit. Worst of all, 7 of these orbs are in the last area of the game (and some are fairly well hidden), and once you beat the last boss you can never return to the area. So, if you've suffered through all the ring challenges, races, gun courses, and scavenger hunts, but you missed that one stinking orb hidden in the ruined tank near the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Metal Head Nest</span>? Better start the whole game over again if you want that last trophy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliceMadnessReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliceMadnessReturns">Alice: Madness Returns</a></em> has the bothersome "Seasoned Campaigner", which requires that you pepper all the snouts in the game. Some of them are well-hidden, and though there is an indicator of how many you've found in a chapter, and things only get worse if you miss one during your first playthrough. Though there is an indicator showing how many snouts remain in each chapter, there is no way of knowing which snouts in a chapter you have already peppered (and for extra tedium, the snouts you've already triggered reappear when you play a level again, so simply hunting for the ones you missed becomes even more of a chore.
<ul><li> "That's Using Your Head" is another painful one. You have to complete the Off With Her Head 2 portion of Chapter 5 in under 6 minutes. Not only is it an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a> with lots of perfectly angled shots required, but the cannons are finicky, and the "ball" you control handles like a severed head (because that's basically what it is). Fortunately, the 6 minute time limit is rather generous, so you have some leeway for mistakes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV">VVVVVV</a></em>'s trinkets were tough to get in general, but three in particular are of note.
<ul><li> "Doing Things The Hard Way", also known as "Veni Vidi Vici", is the most notorious. You must fly upwards through a very spiky and twisty tunnel, land on a disappearing platform, flip over, go <em>back down the same tunnel in reverse</em>, and land on the other side of a wall that is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence">one block high</a></em>.
</li><li> "Prize for the Reckless". You have to navigate a series of rooms to break a disappearing platform which lets a moving platform move, then kill yourself to respawn, flip onto the moving platform, and grab the trinket, without touching any of a number of inconveniently placed checkpoints or dying in between. However, the worst part about this particular achievement isn't necessarily pulling it off, but <em>figuring it out</em>.
</li><li> "Edge Games". This one at least takes place in one single room, but it requires fast work with both the keys and the action button to dodge the moving enemies. Also, you have to be <em>painfully</em> precise with your moves (which is very difficult with the old-school-style controls of this game), or you die before you reach the trinket.
</li><li> There's also the trophy "Master of the Universe". How do you get it? By completing the game. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No Death Mode</a>. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> platformer starring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>. Without saving. Have "fun".
</li><li> Earning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">V</a> ranks on each time trial. Earning a V rank means clearing the segment under a brutally strict time limit, obtaining all the trinkets, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">not dying whatsoever</a> <em>all at once.</em> Sound fun? Probably not. But the most sinister is Space Station 2's time trial. Not only is Space Station 2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">quite long</a>, you have to complete "Veni, Vidi, Vici" <em>perfectly <strong>on your first try</strong></em> and somehow manage to get all the rest of the trinkets and not die all under that unrelenting time limit. Fortunately, "Prize for the Reckless" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">is altered so you don't have to die</a>, but that's very little consolation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim HD</a></em> there's an achievement for going through the whole game on the hardest difficulty setting without dying, as well as beating it on the same setting in under 50 minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>, the Steam version.
<ul><li> The "I LOVE PUNCHING!" achievement requires completing all stages of the target mini-game in Basic Braining, which is frustratingly difficult.
</li><li> "Figgy Piggy" requires collecting all the figments. They are absolutely frustrating to find. There are hundreds of them scattered across several worlds, and even worse, they're <em>partially invisible and 2-D</em>. In a 3-D platformer with very vibrant environments.
</li><li> And finally, both of those are required for the "Math Is Hard" achievement. Getting to rank 101 requires both of the achievements above, plus sorting all the emotional baggage, removing all the mental cobwebs, completing the scavenger hunt, and finding all the PSI challenge markers and cards. These tasks are somewhat tough, but not that difficult compared to the two above.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo">Limbo</a></em> has the "No Point In Dying" achievement. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">You have to survive the whole game in one sitting...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">with 5 or less deaths.</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame">Lego Adaptation Games</a> have their share of these achievements:
<ul><li> <em>LEGO The Lord of the Rings</em> has "We cannot linger", which requires you to beat The Mines of Moria in under 15 minutes. The levels in this game are long enough, but when you're given a time limit for this achievement that long, you know this level is bad. And it's got <em>two</em> boss battles, a horde of Orcs, and plenty of contraption-assembling that will take a long time under normal circumstances.
</li><li> <em>LEGO Star Wars II</em> has the achievements for beating the vehicle levels without dying. The standard levels can be fudged by being the invincible force ghost characters, but the vehicle ones are pure skill.
</li><li> <em>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean</em> has "The worst pirate I've ever seen", which requires you to beat Port Royal, the first level in the game, with zero studs collected. It's more intimidating than it looks, as getting studs is unavoidable. The good news is you just need to have zero studs at the end of the level, but that requires you to get killed by enemies repeatedly and not keep picking up the dropped studs upon death.
</li><li> <em>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</em> has "I'm always angry!", which requires you (as Bruce Banner) to transform into the Hulk 50 times. Not difficult, but <em>extremely</em> tedious, as the transformation animation takes several seconds, and holding down the button to transform won't work; you have to press and hold the button every time, for every transformation sequence, 50 times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLEGOMovie">The LEGO Movie</a> Video Game</em> has the achievements "I Could Sing This Song For Hours" and "No Way, This Is My Jam". Basically, you play a DDR-esque mini-game in two separate levels where you press buttons in time with the music, and you have to get nothing but AWESOME! ratings throughout the entire song. Did we mention that the mini-game takes place about halfway through each level with no skipping and you only get one chance on it each time you play that level? And that if your button press is off by a millisecond it won't count? Made slightly easier by the fact that when playing in Free Play, you can restart it as many times as needed and can quit at any time, but the achievements themselves are still frustratingly difficult.
</li><li> As noted under Rhythm, even <em>Lego <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> is not immune, having "The Final Countdown", an achievement exponentially harder than even That One Achievement in the first two core games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>:
<ul><li> The achievement for getting the Alien Medal, which is given if Ironhead is defeated without taking <em>any</em> damage at all. Ironhead is one of the easiest bosses, but all the crap flying around makes getting this medal an exercise in frustration and repeated reloading.
</li><li> The Steam version gives you an achievement for finishing the game on Hard. Seeing as how the game is pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> as it is, obtaining this achievement is a total nightmare.
</li><li> The Steam version also has achievements for speedrunning the additional Boss Attack, Wind Fortress, and Sanctuary Time Attack. However, the times demanded of the player for the S-Ranks are incredibly strict, meaning the only people getting those achievements at all are highly dedicated speedrunners. Making things even worse for people attempting the Sanctuary is that every single time you die, you are sent back to the starting room and must choose all your weapons then pick up the 2 heart containers again, all of which have painfully slow text prompts. Dying repeatedly to the instant death spike segment at the start? Resetting every time you take a hit from a falling chunk of temple? Better have nerves of steel and a lot of spare time!
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime">Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</a></em> has "Navigate like Drake", which requires you to view every map in every episode. Sounds easy enough, right? But here's the catch: this also includes each area exclusive to missions. Have fun replaying every single level and checking the map each time. And none of this is tracked, either.
<ul><li> Honorable mention goes to "Apollo Wins", which requires you to beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">The Murray Games</a> without messing up just once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> has some particularly nasty achievements, such as the ten achievements for beating the target speedrun time on each level (most levels take at least five to ten minutes, and you get a slim margin of error), but That One Achievement status goes to the Superstar achievement for attaining a Time Trial star rating of 90. There are 96 stars (99 on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> version), so this does mean you can leave two levels and 3-star everything else, or 2 star a bunch of levels, but no matter how you cut it, you will be getting three stars on the vast majority of the levels. Hope you like replaying time trials over and over until you finally shave off enough milliseconds for that 3-star run!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckTales">DuckTales Remastered</a> has "Look Ma! No Spats!", which requires going to the Amazon, then pogo-jumping from one end of the underground area to the other, ending by climbing the rope back to the surface. Except that the snakes and spiders make it nearly impossible, and you also have to master button-tapping to end Scrooge's pogo-jumping shortly to avoid touching the thorns on the ceiling, while keeping him pogo-jumping to avoid landing on the ground on his feet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAngryVideoGameNerdAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAngryVideoGameNerdAdventures">The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures</a></em> has "Complete Badass" and "Bow before the God of Video Games!"; The two achievements are for beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Fucking</a> Impossible mode and Yolo mode, respectively, but those two modes are much easier said than done. In f'ing impossible mode, you only get five lives, one hit kills you, and there are no checkpoints at all. Yolo mode, however... You get only one life, and only one hit point. Get hit even <em>once</em> at any time, and it's back to the tutorial level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PauseAhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PauseAhead">Pause Ahead</a></em> has "Untouchable", which you get for completing the game in one go with no deaths. Bear in mind, this game is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathCourse">Death Course</a> all the way through that uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">Death Is a Slap on the Wrist</a> just to make it manageable.
<ul><li> Just as unforgiving (if not even <em>more</em> so) is the innocuously-named "Trinket Collector". You get this one for collecting every trinket in one run. The issue here is that these trinkets only show up in speedrun mode, often in ridiculously out-of-the-way spots that you'd never think to search in, and in order for the achievement to count you also need to speedrun the whole game in <strong>five minutes</strong> on top of collecting these trinkets. Sure, the game might be short, but five minutes is a tall order even without the trinkets, never mind with them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanLegends">Rayman Legends</a></em> has "Sooo Rich!" and "Truly Awesome!" ("Millionaire" and "Awesome!" in the PS Vita version.) They require obtaining 1 million Lums (to unlock the final character) and reaching level 11 Awesomeness, respectively. These both require ridiculous amounts of grinding to obtain. If you fully completed the game (beat every level, obtained every cup, rescued all the Teensies, and scratched all the Lucky Tickets), you'll be at about 500,000 Lums and level 10 Awesomeness. The final level of Awesomeness requires 2,000 points to reach from level 10. The second-best prize, a gold cup, is worth only 10 points, and getting a diamond cup (50 points) on a Daily/Weekly Challenge is nearly impossible without cheating. If you get gold cups on every single challenge, you'll earn 20 points a day, and 20 extra per week, which adds up to about 160 points a week. At this rate, it'll take you over <strong>three months</strong> to earn it, after beating the game 100%, assuming that you get gold cups every single day and week.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFloorIsJelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheFloorIsJelly">The Floor is Jelly</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Speedrun" achievement requires you to beat the game within an extremely tight <em>30 minutes</em>. For comparison, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoYYI8zK-14">currently fastest speedrun so far<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> beat the game in <em>over 22 minutes</em>. You'll practically need to memorise the puzzle solutions in the Wetlands stage, the erratic placement of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the deadly glitch blocks</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a>, and have tons of luck with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the glitchy physics</span> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>.
</li><li> The "Minimalist" achievement requires you to beat the game within 920 jumps, and you <em>can't check to see how many times you've jumped so far</em>. To elaborate, you'll often need to jump several times in one place to get a high enough bounce, and then there's all the times you'll need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump">Wall Jump</a>.
</li><li> And then there's "&amp;@&hearts;@@p&sect;&#9786;A!&#9675;&#9688;@)(@)_&mdash;-A" and "U KNO WUT I LUV", both with completely unknown requirements. Good luck trying to obtain them without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">resorting to an online guide</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em> has a few that are tediously hard and are best approached with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>.
<ul><li> "Hurry Up!" requires you to complete the game in under 90 minutes. In addition to speed-running each level, you still have to collect enough money to buy relics along with health and mana upgrades. The extra cherry on top is needing to dodge the random map encounters while moving between stages, which becomes a big hassle by the time you move to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefinitelyFinalDungeon">Definitely Final Dungeon</a>.
</li><li> "Impossible!" and "Perfect Platformer" mesh well, the first requiring no deaths in a playthrough and the second requiring no deaths to bottomless pits. All it takes is one misstep to restart the entire level over again. And then there are the random map encounters where dying will automatically be recorded to your save, unlike normal stages where they only count if you finish first.
</li><li> "Untouched" requires you to complete a level against a member of the Order without taking any damage. Even against the easiest member, King Knight, all it takes is a single mistake to force a complete restart of the level.
</li></ul></li><li> Unlocking the Shrapnel Bomb in <em>Super House of Dead Ninjas</em> requires you to reach the first boss without killing a single enemy. This is a game that asks you to kill about a dozen enemies before you leave the <em>tutorial</em> area, and even if you skip it by blowing up the wall at its start, placing that bomb wrong can kill something. And after you're out of there, if you take a hit, the Crimson Ninja does a spinning kick as she gets up, which is likely to kill something. Oh, and <em>breaking a set of spikes</em> (which you'll do automatically with the spinning kick if you get killed by them) counts as a kill. Have fun trying desperately to avoid so much as brushing up against anything for 100 floors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia">Prince of Persia</a> Classic</em> has the Survivor achievement for completing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">Survival Mode</a>, where if you die even once it's back to square one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpoilerAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpoilerAlert">Spoiler Alert</a></em> has the Mariachi Champ achievement, which requires you to get Gold Star rank (go through the level without doing any time paradoxes) on all 10 levels in the Mariachi World. The "final" level requires very precise jumps, where jumping even one second too late creates a time paradox. Be prepared to restart over and over again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a> Legacy Collection</em> has two related to challenges:
<ul><li> "All Appearing Blocks" has you facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">every single appearing block section</a> throughout the first six <em>Mega Man</em> games that the collection covers, one after the other. The hard part is that you don't have any items besides Rush Coil in the appropriate sections to help you bypass them easily. Item-2? No chance. Rush Jet? Forget it.
</li><li> The "Unstoppable" achievement, which puts you in a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> against every Robot Master from all six games... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">with only your Mega Buster</a>. Good luck trying to take down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Elec Man, Ice Man, and Shadow Man among others</a>. Fortunately, if you die, you just restart at the current Robot Master... except however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">Death Is a Slap on the Wrist</a> is completely averted; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">the whole thing is on a</a> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">time limit</a></strong>, something the <em>Mega Man</em> franchise rarely uses. Run out of time, and you have to <em>start all over and your effort is for naught</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dustforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dustforce">Dustforce</a></em> feels like it's parodying this: it only <em>has</em> one achievement, but you unlock it by getting a perfect SS+ rank on every level. Only 0.3% of Steam players have it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BionicCommando">Bionic Commando</a> Rearmed</em>: "Elite Commando", for beating the game on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Super Hard</a> difficulty, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, and "A Real Challenge", for completing all of the Challenge Rooms, the later ones of which require incredible precision and reflexes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabiRibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabiRibi">Rabi-Ribi</a></em> is as hard as you think a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> Metroidvania might be. This also makes the harder achievements agonizingly difficult on the last, hardest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a> difficulty: Bunny Extinction. Completing the entire game, Main story and post-game content, on the hardest difficulty easy enough for you? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Now defeat every boss in a row with the same difficulty!</a> The final achievement of this caliber requires you to beat the game in less than an hour, challenging even speedrunners playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasierThanEasy">Casual Mode</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OriAndTheBlindForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OriAndTheBlindForest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a>: Definitive Edition</em> has "Unhinged" for completing the game in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">Final Death Mode</a>. Save copying is disabled in this mode, so unlike "Immortal", you cannot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">save scum</a> your way to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightInTheWoods">Night in the Woods</a></em> has "Seriously?" for acquiring every single notebook sketch. However, finding them requires talking to absolutely everyone on every single day, partaking of every single sidequest as soon as it is available, and combing every inch of Possum Springs for background elements to examine, several of which are as far from "obvious" as you can hope to get. The trophy description itself says the <em>developers</em> have never gotten that achievement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleNightmares">Little Nightmares</a></em> has "Hard to the Core", which on top of not having a proper description on the achievement page (it just reads "What makes you so different?") requires you to complete the whole game in under an hour without dying. The only caveats you have are you don't have to do it in one sitting, and that dying only counts when you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">actually die</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puzzle&nbsp;</div><div id="folder12" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>, also by Valve, has the despair-inducing "Transmission Received". This not only requires that 26 tiny radios be discovered and grabbed, and not only that each of them are taken to a single spot in the entire level, specific for each radio, so their red light changes to green, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">none of this is in the achievement description</a></em>, reading only "...?..." (It's worth noting that this puzzle/achievement was only added to the game as part of an ARG in the run-up to <em>Portal 2</em>'s release.)
<ul><li> "Aperture Science" requires you to get a gold medal in every challenge. The 'least portals' challenges are fairly easy, as they just require you to think about the right places to put your portals (although you do have to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">perfect portal placement</a> in some cases). The 'least steps' challenges are much harder. You have to jump out of the elevator as far as possible in every chamber, put your portals in exactly the right places and pull off very difficult feats in order to get those portals in the right places (and you'll often be pulling off these shots in mid-air). Not to mention that in some levels, you have to hop around and get as much height as possible from every single hop. But the worst are the 'least time' challenges. For the gold medals, you don't just have to do things a bit faster than normal; you have to do absolutely everything in one fluid movement, never check to make sure that you've done something right and NEVER SCREW UP. Good luck!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> has "Professor Portal", which requires you to play co-op with someone you've befriended who's never played before. This may have been easy when the game first launched, but good luck finding someone who hasn't played co-op at least once after a month or two. It doesn't count for random players, either. You have to invite a friend. Then there's the moderately less difficult but still frustrating "Still Alive". It requires you to beat Course 4 without either player dying once. Easy in theory, but in practice it you'll be somewhat hard-pressed to find a partner with the necessary coordination and skill to accomplish this, especially in the final chambers. And of course, there's always human error when it comes to portal placement. Finally, there's "Portal Conservation Society", which requires you to beat chamber 3 of course 3 using only five portals between you and your partner. This requires some annoying exploitation of angles and object straddling to see walls which you normally can't, and you can't die or misplace a single portal (dying resets your portals). It's like they made it to test speed runners.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bejeweled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bejeweled">Bejeweled</a> 2</em> has an achievement for completing 280 levels in Endless Mode. Endless Mode is simply Classic Mode with no timer and a guaranteed match. What makes this a trope example is not just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> involved - most people seem to get this achievement in 160 to 320 hours of game play! - but that there is a combination of a bug and poor design in the game that affects saved games. You can only have one saved game per mode: when you resume play, the saved game is deleted, and when you stop, a new save is created. However, Endless Mode is only available to people with the paid version of the game, and that's determined by checking with Microsoft's servers prior to saving your progress. If you lose your Xbox Live connection during the game, then the game can't verify that you own it, and it will assume that you own the trial version and thus can't save your progress ... and because your previous save was deleted, you either have to pause the game until Xbox Live is running again or lose all your progress!
</li><li> Sort of puzzle: quiz website Sporcle has Badges for completing certain tasks. Some are easy (playing a few games, linking your page to social networks), while others will need memorization and\or many tries (all 205 countries in the world, all of the periodic table), or spending too much time on the website (1000 overall games or on certain categories, * games per day, at least one game for * days).
<ul><li> "Gambler" is a badge linked to two games - "The Uncheatable Game" and "Heads or Tails". You need 50% or better. The former is quite literally clicking on boxes and praying you don't click on the one that ends the game (which is randomized), while the latter is just you typing H or T at each box (again, it's randomized what the "correct" letter is). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> doesn't come much purer than this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Hexic HD</em> on Xbox 360 has the "Grand Pearl Poo-Bah" achievement, which requires surrounding one piece with 6 Black Pearls. Getting one Black Pearl requires surrounding one piece with 6 Starflowers, and getting one Starflower requires surrounding one piece with 6 of the same color. What makes this so hard is not only positioning the pieces properly to score 43 surrounds <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1jlxf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1jlxf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1jlxf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">36 surrounds with same-colored pieces for all the necessary Starflowers + 6 surrounds with said Starflowers for the Black Pearls + 1 surround with the Black Pearls</span>, but also the increased diversity of colors at higher levels as well as the immediate threat of bombs that will end your game upon exploding. Undercutting the difficulty is that <em>Hexic HD</em> had an exploit to make getting pearls easier. Then then, there's <em>also</em> the possibility of accidentally matching 3 Starflowers and erasing a ton of work.

<ul><li> The "Gold Standard" trophy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a> 5</em>. Finishing all of the races? OK, but boring since it also includes the endurances. Getting gold on all license tests? Hard-as-hell. Getting gold on all Special Events? All ok until Grand Tour, which starts to get difficult. Then we have the Sebastien Loeb Challenge. The Toscana Time Trial is not difficult, But Eiger Nordwand is tough and Chamonix is hell. And there's the Sebastian Vettel X Challenge. Good luck trying to get gold on it, because the only way of doing it is reaching level 40 and buy the car to train on the tracks.(You can also get the car by reaching one of your B-Spec Drivers to level 30)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout">Wipeout</a> HD</em> (and by extension, <em>Fury</em>) has an achievement called "Beat Zico". This requires you to beat a lap time of 30.92 in Anulpha Pass on Venom using the Piranha. Even though the Piranha has the best top speed in the game, this is <em>much</em> more difficult than it sounds, partially because Venom is the slowest speed class.
<ul><li> Bling Brigade, mainly for the sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> factor. You have to unlock the chrome skin, which is done through clearing HD Campaign, and then using it in a race with 7 other people using that skin. Now, this might not seem so bad, but it's a <em>hidden trophy</em>, meaning you have no way of knowing how to get it until you do unlock it.
</li><li> Zone Zeus also deserves a mention. It's a tremendous endurance race where you must reach zone 75 on any track. The problem is, you're far more likely to have a seizure from concentrating so much on the track with all its psychedelic lights than you are of actually reaching Zone 75, especially since after every Zone the car's speed increases, eventually making it some sort of uncontrollable missile. You need unreal levels of focus and timing for this one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TwistedMetal">Twisted Metal</a> 2012</em> gives a lot of achievements like this, like playing the game for 30 days straight to beating the game on Insane difficulty getting a gold achievement in each mission and never once being killed. Did I mention there is a Sniper Rifle that causes instant death and the AI are very quick to use them?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fuel">Fuel</a></em> has two matching achievements, "Salt over Snow" and "Sand to Stone" that require literally driving from one corner of the map to the most-distant corner. Due to the sheer size of the map, the trip can easily last <em>two hours in real time</em>. And that's just for <em>one</em> of the achievements.
</li><li> Driving simulator <em>iRacing</em> features many that are achievable such as winning your first race or completing five races without incidents (off-tracks/contact/etc.). However it also features achievements for achieving a rating of 9000 or higher (which would make you the highest rated driver worldwide) and an achievement for winning official online races in every single car. This is not so much a matter of patience as it is of absolute skill. The achievement is named 'The Alien', which is quite appropriate. If you achieve it, you are certainly not human. Not even any of the many professional drivers who use the simulator daily have it, and indeed only one individual has ever achieved it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em> has special titles that work in the same way as achievements. Some of them are extremely difficult to get:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessVictory">"Undefeated Winner of the Highway" / "Undefeated Highway Dominator"</a> requires a complete run of Story Mode without losing a single stage <em>at all</em>. It's particularly difficult in <em>Maximum Tune 2</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultyDrop">easier</a> in <em>Maximum Tune 3</em> due to the more lenient AI, but is still very much one of those "one mistake and you blow up to $100 worth of credits" moments. It's possible to feign this by having another player challenge you or to unplug or reset the machine if you are about to lose, causing the stage to not count, but the former requires an additional credit and wastes time on a versus race, and the latter can not only be unsafe, but most if not all arcades prohibit the practice and will very likely boot you if you get caught. <em>Maximum Tune 4</em> and later alleviate this by allowing you to retire a race and not have it count against your win streak, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">this is not hinted to in-game</a>, you have to opt into enabling retiring, and because of the way retiring is done &mdash; turn around and drive for three seconds &mdash; if your opponent is less than 700 meters from the goal, a retire will not save you.
</li><li> The continue-based titles, which require playing anywhere from 10 to 40 consecutive credits. This requires a lot of time, a lot of money, in most cases no one else waiting to play (continuing to play in the presence of waiting players is considered a very rude practice in many arcades) and finally, at least as many plays left on your card as there are credits needed for the title you want, because if your card expires and you have to renew it, that breaks your continue chain. <em>Maximum Tune 4</em> no longer has card renewal, but in exchange the last continue title now takes <em>60</em> consecutive continues.
</li><li> There's a unique title for each time you beat Story Mode on the same car...but there are <em>a few hundred</em> story completion titles, the last title and this game's undisputed king of grind titles being "WM<em>(insert version here)</em> COMPLETED!" at <strong>255 completions of Story Mode</strong>. Oh, and each loop is 60 stages, and you have to continue after each stage. 255 loops * 60 stages = <em>FIFTEEN-THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STAGES.</em> And yes, <a class="urllink" href="https://soarsmedia.blogspot.kr/2016/10/wmmt5dx-round-clear-title.html">one person has photographic evidence of this title<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. No points for guessing how many others are willing to go for this title.
</li></ul></li><li> For <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForzaMotorsport4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForzaMotorsport4">Forza Motorsport 4</a></em>'s "Unicorn Hunter" achievement, you have to either: a) win an exorbitantly high bid on a unicorn car at the Auction House, b) get a fast time in a certain Community Monthly Rivals event, or c) import one from <em>Forza 3</em> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>. Since Turn 10 ceased updating the Rivals events in 2013 as well as no longer offering unicorns for auction, if you were late to the party and don't have a <em>Forza 3</em> save with a unicorn, you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">out of luck</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Forza Motorsport 6</em> has an achievement called "Thru the Pack", which requires you to start last in a multiplayer race with 24 cars (yes, as in 24 actual human players) and finish first. Oh, and this can only be done in a public lobby. Firstly, as mentioned before, you will need 24 players. Even during launch, you would be hard-pressed to find a full 24 player lobby. Secondly, you need to start in last place. Where you start is completely random, with you having only a 4.2% chance of starting last. It is possible to go through dozens of races without ever starting last. Finally, there's your opponents themselves, who are often either people who like to play Bumper Cars with everyone else or Forza gods who corner and accelerate flawlessly. Combine all three of these and what you get is one brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">luck</a> <em>and</em> skill based achievement.
<ul><li> This achievement returns yet again in <em>Forza Motorsport 7</em>, in the form of the "Underdog" achievement. Thankfully, it can be done in a private lobby where you can manipulate the grid order and simply let whoever starts in 24th win.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> has "Certified Adventurer". This achievement requires you to qualify for a league in Ranked Team Adventure. To qualify, you need to complete ten placement adventures to receive a league. It doesn't sound too bad...on paper. In reality? "Finding a ranked session." "Not enough players accepted the found match. Looking for another session." You'll spend more time searching for a session than actually playing a session. Oh, and once you finally get to play a session, you'd better pray that you don't get disconnected or the game will think you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a> and slap you with a ban. Just completing one adventure is a pain in the ass, let alone ten.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a></em> (the 2015 game)'s SpeedLists Update may as well be a kick in the nuts for anyone who thought this game was an easy completion. "Gold Plated" requires you to win gold on all events in Prestige Mode (essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a> difficulty). To do that requires you to do things such as beat some ludicrously fast time or score an unrealistic amount of drift points. Simply put, you need near-godlike skills if you want to have a shot at those golds. Hell, even winning bronze is a struggle. To give you an idea of how hard the time and point requirements are, according to TrueAchievements, only <em>6</em> out of 40,000 tracked gamers have this achievement as of August 2016 (over three months since the update was first released). It's gotten so bad that there's <a class="urllink" href="http://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Impossible-to-get-gold-on-all-Prestige-events/m-p/5315512#U5315512">an ever-growing petition on EA's website about making the requirements easier<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> Another achievement from the update, "Speed Master", isn't much easier. It requires you to win all events in a Speedlist, which essentially means win 5 multiplayer races in a row. With the random traffic spawns (traffic cars spawning too close in front of you to avoid right when the race begins is not unheard of) and players out to ram you off the road at every opportunity, this is easier said than done.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>F1 2013</em> has the "Always Believe in Yourself" achievement. You need to beat the gold time in the time attack of the classic 80s, driving the 1988 Williams car in Jerez. This is a very hard achievement to earn since the 80s cars are much more difficult to drive and Jerez is one of the hardest circuits of the game. And you can't change the car setup and can't cut the corners either.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series points in this trope for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">requiring proprietary instrument controllers</a> for a good deal of their achievements, especially in the third game with its specifically customized guitar and keyboard, but it started as far back as requiring the use of solo buttons in the earlier renditions.
</li><li> And then, there is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">trope-naming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">Bladder of Steel</a>. In the second game, this was over 6 hours. No breaks. No saving. <em>No pausing</em>. It's not in the third game.
</li><li> Lego Rock Band has The Final Countdown, which requires one to 100% the guitar solo on that song, on Expert. One can get all of the other achievements in Lego Rock Band, and all the achievements in the first and second games, and be nowhere close to being able to get this one. So when <em>Rock Band 3</em> came back and reintroduced around four of the Lego achievements, of course this had to be one of them.
</li><li> It's hard to choose in <em>Rock Band 3</em>, but there are three training-mode ones that require pretty high ability on pro guitar, pro keys, and drums. Each of these requires a full combo on each of many small segments. No doubt at least one of those will be a lot of trouble to any player, even after purchasing the instrument controllers necessary. Fortunately, the very hardest goals (get 5 stars on every song on Expert Pro Guitar!) are not achievements.
</li><li> <em>Rock Band Blitz</em> has two: "Party At Your Place" (play <strong>300</strong> unique songs) and "Music Historian" (play a song from each decade since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>). The first one is annoying for someone who only buys DLC occasionally. The second one...

Two choices: buy a DLC song that is really long, or do nearly perfect on Through the Fire and the Flames Expert. It took months for a single person to do it the second way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TaikoNoTatsujin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TaikoNoTatsujin">Taiko no Tatsujin</a> V Version has one for beating <em>25</em> different songs on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">infamously difficult Oni difficulty</a>. Even if switching between normal and Shin-Uchi mode lets you get 2 crowns for each song, just clearing one of them is hard enough.
<ul><li> Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session is even worse regarding difficult trophies, but special mention goes to the "Extreme EX Relay Full Combo 10,000!" trophy, which requires you to get <em>10000 consecutive hits on Extreme/Oni difficulty songs... rated 8* or higher.</em> Seeing how just CLEARING a song like that can be hard enough...
</li></ul></li><li> Oddly enough, Room With A View on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDiva">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA</a> X</em>. It requires you to complete certain requests, which tend to be on the more difficult side. The last one in particular is a pain, since it requires you to perform the Ultimate Exquisite Rampage medley on Extreme. Not only does it live up to its name by consisting of (mostly) the hardest parts of the five hardest songs in the series, but you need to get a punishingly high score as well.
<ul><li> Event Organizer, which requires you to unlock all events in the game - which involves clearing <em>all</em> requests (Cloud and Event). Not only is this grindy and time-consuming, but it also involves the final Cloud Request for the Ultimate Medley - now with 3 versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> and requiring a much higher score than required from any other requests involving this song...

<ul><li> The game has a myriad of achievements requiring you to beat the game with certain special characters in your party, who will only show up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">on the whims of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a>. Then there is the mother-of-all-RNG-based achievements, "Dog Squad", which requires you to finish the game with a full party of dogs&mdash; and <em>only dogs.</em> Never mind that dogs have two-thirds the HP of standard human characters and cannot wield weapons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unless they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">by themselves</a></span>&mdash; you'd be lucky to find <em>more than one dog</em> in the average playthrough, even on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Long Winding Road mode!</a> This is currently the least-obtained achievement in the game, sitting at a measly 0.1%.
</li><li> "Has Left the Building" requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Alvis</a> to reach his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> twice. Obtaining Alvis himself is very much luck-based, and one needs plenty of time to break him twice. Getting Alvis himself to break can also be luck-based, as deliberately lowering morale may result in other party members' despair events triggering instead.
</li><li> "The Loneliest Road" requires beating the game with just a single character, without recruiting anyone. It's difficult to fend off zombie hordes alone, and just as difficult to maintain a steady cache of supplies with bandits running amok.
</li><li> "Mr. Popular" requires completing the game with Mason in the party. Mason constantly makes party members "disappear" through random events, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">will leave on his own terms if he's alone.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em> has a few that could definitely qualify.
<ul><li> "Ancestry" requires you to go through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">That One Sidequest</a> in the Rock Cruiser. While the Rock Cruiser does get a blue option during the first stage of the quest, this is still a ridiculously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>.
<ul><li> Alternatively, you can unlock the alt form of the ship, which comes with the crew member you usually have to jump through the first three hoops to get. You still have to reach the Rock homeworld and hope to come across the correct waypoint by chance, but at least you're not attempting to find two completely separate random encounters AND the Rock homeworld in the correct order, with none of the three being assured in any way.
</li><li> Alternatively alternatively, you can get the alt ship, change the special crew member's name to the random encounter special crewman's name, save, quit, and then load your game. Congrats, the game now thinks your special crewman is THE special crewman, and will kindly mark the required waypoint. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Never mind how you'd know what that name is without searching a guide</a>, but at least now you just have to find the Rock homeworld, though even THAT can take a few tries.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of the Rock Cruiser and ridiculous achievements, "Is it warm in here?" requires you to kill a burning enemy with a boarder on their ship. Even setting aside the inherent difficulty of getting the equipment required, the problems here are evident. AI crewmen will retreat from burning rooms or boarders when they get low on health, and Rockmen often can't deal enough damage to kill them before they get out. It also doesn't count if the fire whittles them down or if they asphyxiate; your boarder must deal the killing blow. It basically boils down to maxing out the combat skills on your boarders and then faking out the AI, or taking advantage of the Rebel Flagship's compartmentalized weapon subsystems.
</li><li> For a non-ship specific example, "BOARDING OBJECTIVE SUCCESSFUL" makes you kill 4 enemy crewmen with a single Boarding Drone. Boarding Drones are AI-controlled, and while they've got the health of a Rockman and the damage output of a Mantis, four enemy crewmen is asking a lot.
</li><li> "Astronimcally Low Odds" is basically all luck, making you get hit by five successive shots with a fully powered engine.
<ul><li> Against enemies heavy in beam weapons, though, it's fairly easy to get, as beams automatically hit.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> All of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueLegacy">Rogue Legacy</a>'s</em> achievements for beating the optional bosses are this, but especially Syngenesophobia, which requires you to beat ALL of the optional bosses (only 2.1% of players have managed to beat even the easiest of those, with the hardest being a mere 1% of players. Not only are the bosses extremely difficult to beat due to the fact that you fight them with preset, fairly weak characters while they are all made much more powerful than their basic versions, but you also have to find a specific item to unlock the ability to confront them in the first place), then beat the optional final boss, who is (frustratingly) also a little bit glitchy. Katagelasticism is essentially the same thing, as you can only unlock the achievement by using the class you unlock by beating the optional final boss, and then fighting the real final boss with a character of said class.
<ul><li> The "Thanatophobia" trophy requires you to beat the game <em>within 15 deaths or less.</em> A typical run can result in many times that many deaths. This also means that since starting over as a new character is the only way to equip gear, you'll be having to make do with weaker weapons and enchantments longer than you usually do. You also can't use the Architect to lock down the castle to make the process easier. It's a 100G achievement/gold trophy for a reason.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DRL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DRL">DRL</a></em> Badges generally come in series and are sorted by difficulty into Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond and Angelic tiers. The Armorer series feature Armorer Gold, for which the player has to pick up every exotic, unique and artifact item once (over multiple games). What makes it That One Achievement is the fact that the player has to pick up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Dragonslayer sword</a>, which is not only extremely rare to find, but <em>cannot be picked up</em> without fulfilling specified secret conditions. Made even worse by the fact that there's a consensus by the devs and the few players who managed to pick it up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotSpoilThisEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotSpoilThisEnding">keep the requirements secret</a> - no spoilers for you, anywhere. Made <em>even worse</em> by the devs being fond of <em>changing the requirements</em> between versions. Compare this with Armorer Platinum, which requires the player to pick up a total of 1000 exotics/uniques/artifacts (which is perfectly achievable through patience only), and you get a case of major frustration.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> Rebirth</em>, pretty much any of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">The Lost's</a> achievements qualify, but the crowner is Godhead. Oh, so the hours and hours of rerolling the Lost finally paid off, and you've completed the Chest, the Dark Room, and the Boss Rush? Did you do it on Hard Mode? No? Well, no Godhead for you. Get back to rerolling!
<ul><li> Rectified in <em>Afterbirth</em>, which starts The Lost with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleUseShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleUseShield">the Holy Mantle</a> once they donate enough to the Greed Mode machine, allowing them to be hit once per room. It's somewhat balanced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovingTheGoalposts">the DLC adding even more requirements for unlocking Godhead</a>, but it's still far easier to unlock overall.
</li><li> Dark Boy and Dead Boy. Dark Boy requires you to beat the Depths/Necropolis without taking a hit, while Dead Boy requires you to do the same for <em>the Chest or the Dark Room</em>. The former has gaps all over the place that restrict your movement along with a large selection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>, while the latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> with <em>bosses</em> in place of regular enemies.
</li><li> <em>Afterbirth+</em> introduced two new achievements related to beating The Lamb: "ZIP!", a tricky but doable achievement for beating it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun">under 20 minutes</a>, and "It's The Key", which requires defeating The Lamb without collecting any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistRun">coins, hearts, or bombs.</a> It is <em>incredibly</em> easy to pick any of those up by accident and ruin the entire run. It holds the distinction of (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100000%</a>, which requires getting It's The Key) being the achievement that the fewest players on Steam have gotten, with a 1.9% completion rate.
</li><li> <em>Afterbirth+</em> also brings us Ultra Hard, the toughest challenge scenario in the game. There's quite a lot of elements that contribute to its difficulty, here's a list:
<ul><li> Health can never appear on the ground, meaning no random red hearts or soul hearts. If you never find a healing item, all damage is permanent.
</li><li> All enemies are Champion variants, meaning they deal twice the normal damage, have much more health, and can occasionally have additional effects including secreting damaging creep, regenerating after death, and exploding into 8 tears upon death.
</li><li> All floors are guaranteed to have Curse of the Labyrinth <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28n9v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28n9v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28n9v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Floors are normally in pairs, e.g. Basement I, Basement II, Caves I, Caves II, but Labyrinth stacks the two floors together and has two boss fights in a row at the end</span>, Curse of the Maze<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3545n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3545n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3545n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Occasionally teleports you to a nearby room upon exiting a room, and can sometimes switch two rooms' position on the floor</span>, Curse of the Lost <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4btv0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4btv0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4btv0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No map, and when combined with Curse of the Maze, can make navigation nearly impossible depending on luck</span>, and Curse of the Blind<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5b9e7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5b9e7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5b9e7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can't see what an item is until you pick it up, removing your ability to judge if an item will ruin or save your run</span>

</li><li> The only way to win the run is to beat Mega Satan at the end, who is a tanky multi-phase boss that will summon a total of <em>13</em> minibosses during the fight.

This game has long falls, enemies that sneak up nearly soundlessly on you, enemies that cannot be killed <em>at all</em>, statues that move to hurt you when you don't look at them, enemies that fly, enemies that throw projectiles, spike traps and pits, tripwires, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">goddamned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometry">wall and floor mounted</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">exploding</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesDoNotBelongThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesDoNotBelongThere">eyeballs</a>.</em> So yeah, good luck not taking any damage~!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnterTheGungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnterTheGungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a></em> has <em>Lead God</em>.

Lead God requires you to do this with each boss that drops a Master Round, and if you decide to do it the normal way without unlocking all the shortcuts<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7mg1t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7mg1t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7mg1t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which unlocks Boss Rush mode</span>, you have to beat every floor's boss in one run without taking a single hit. Slip up just once, and your nearly-perfect half-hour-long run could be all for nothing. Fortunately, the game counts multiple copies of a Master Round as different items, so you can use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Clone</a> (which sends you back to the start of the game with all of your items if you die) to cheese it... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">if you can find the damn thing during one of your runs.</a>
<ul><li> Lead God is difficult, but doable, especially with the addition of the Boss Rush mode in a recent patch. The achievement most worthy of 'That One' status as of this writing is <em>Challenger,</em> which requires completing the newly-added Challenge Mode. To explain, they took the already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> roguelike and somehow <em>made it</em> <em><strong>much</strong></em> <em>harder</em> with the addition of room modifiers that range from being bombarded by missiles from offscreen, making certain enemies invincible until all the others are killed first, punishing missed shots by spawning in enemies, making the normally harmless debris and breakable pots shoot bullets at you when damaged, and a whole list of other hindrances. It's not so bad at first when you only have to deal with one per room, but - you guessed it - a room could be affected by <em>up to three modifiers at once.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">This includes boss rooms,</a> and some challenges are <em>tailor-made</em> for bosses past the fourth chamber. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneFinalBoss">Disk-One Final Boss</a> also gets a string of new, faster attacks, <strong>all of which are guaranteed to deal a 5-second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> effect</strong> regardless of your health because of another modifier, which also has a chance of showing up in sealed rooms on any floor. You might think that the game will allow you to test your luck skills for free, but the harsh truth is that you also have to pay <em>6</em> Hegemony credits every time you want to try again. For reference, you get about 2-3 on average from beating bosses<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8niak');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8niak" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8niak');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Luckily, after release of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons update it's possible to get up to <em>10</em> credits for killing bosses without taking damage.</span>, and 5 from beating the game.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9cqga');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9cqga" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9cqga');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After attempting 30 times, the game gives you a breather and reduces the price to one hegemony credit... but that's still 180 credits you have to fork over before the closest thing to a mercy mode kicks in, so it barely helps in the long run. What's worse, the game mockingly gives you Chaos Bullets after your 30th attempt, which you'd normaly get as a reward for completing challenge mode, somewhat rendering the whole mode useless, unless you are aiming for the achievement.</span> All these things combined make it easy to see why this achievement is the 2nd least obtained by all players on Steam, <a class="urllink" href="http://steamcommunity.com/stats/311690/achievements/">sitting at a mere 1.7%<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> In the latest major update Advanced Dungeons and Draguns, a new optional challenge became available. If you manage to defeat Resourceful Rat in Punch-Out fight with at least two keys, you can find a secret room inside loot room, which is locked behind two gates; using keys to open these gates, you'll find a small serpent inside. Feeding four items to this serpent will make it achieve its last form. When the fight with the Dragun engages, the serpent suddenly starts to fight with the Dragun against the player, and after the player almost defeats the Dragun in his second phase, the boss suddenly grabs the serpent and absorbs all its power, entering his third phase. Not only getting access to this advanced phase is hard enough, the phase itself is (quite obviously) <em>very challenging</em> &#150; simply put, all Dragun's attacks become their advanced versions. The fight proved to be beatable only for 0.9% of the players.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherEden">Another Eden</a></em> has plenty of achievements to obtain, and most of them award Chronos Stones which are used for summoning additional allies. There's plenty to go around for a player to get a well-developed roster without spending a single cent on the game, but some achievements are infamous for their difficulty. Some of these even give a disproportionately small reward for the amount of effort they require.
<ul><li> "Warlord" and "Veteran Walker" are incredibly hard to get &mdash; the former requires victory in 1 million battles, and the latter requires the party to walk 10 million steps. You could play for months before even coming close to earning these achievements.
</li><li> "Overcoming the True Form" is earned by beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of part 1 without defeating any of the prior Prime Elements. This means fighting it while it is regenerating at least 6000 health a turn, without an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Another Force bar</a>, while it's passively damaging your party, and while it alternates between absorbing physical and magic attacks, among other things. If your roster has a variety of mages and maybe a few 5-star characters, it's a little more tedious than difficult, but for a player without those luxuries it's quite the daunting task.
</li><li> "Stroke of Luck" requires the player to make it to the final area of the Phantom Crystal Dimension. You can only access it with a White Key that has a 10% drop rate from Another Dungeon runs. You are then presented with a set of doors to pick from, one of which lets you advance to the next room containing chests with increasingly valuable prizes, while the others will end your journey, forcing you to leave with whatever you've found. The doors are randomized, so it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> to get to the end.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note106o7r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note106o7r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note106o7r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You effectively have a <em>0.9% chance</em> of succeeding.</span> If you do manage this achievement, though, you are also awarded the Dimension's ultimate prize, which is a <em>lot</em> of loot and money, including a guaranteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">three Chant Scripts and a Treatise of your choice</a>.
</li><li> Every random encounter has a set of three achievements &mdash; one for your first kill, another for your twentieth, and a third for your hundredth. This also extends to the elusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Alarmed enemies</a>, which are prone to running away at the first opportunity and mandate immediate use of Another Force to kill. Getting to 100 for these requires astounding amounts of luck, and is more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingMinigame">Fishing Minigame</a>, every species of fish you can catch has a set of achievements for catching multiples of them, up to your 150th catch. This includes fishing enemies, strong Horrors, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">the Lake Lords</a>. Some normal fish species like the Rinde Sunfish are also exceedingly rare, which makes it very tedious to progress its achievement set. Catching 150 of these rare or tough fish is more or less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>: Getting the Master Slasher's Trophy requires you to ascend a weapon with Bladestone to Sharp+5. All of the stones are random drops, but the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> is getting the 1 Pure Bladestone needed to finish the weapon. Only 2 Black Skeletons in 4-2 have a chance at dropping it at all, one in a hidden passage and another that only shows up in Pure Black World Tendency, the hardest difficulty in any world. The real crux of it all, however, is that Pure Bladestone's drop rate is bugged. The fact is that World Tendency is a much greater spectrum than the game insinuates, with it actually going from -200 (True Pure Black) and +200 (True Pure White). Where this comes into play is that when World Tendency is between -100 and -150, Pure Bladestone's drop rate <strong>tanks</strong> to a point where it can be as bad as <strong>2/50000</strong>. Meanwhile if it's been bottomed out to -200, the rate is closer to a still low, but very much manageable 1.3% instead. Not knowing this can make the difference between getting it after a few attempts, or never getting it at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1">Dark Souls 1</a></em> has Knight's Honor, which requires you to get every single rare/unique weapon in the game. Problem is that most of those are weapons forged from boss souls. You only get one of each boss soul per playthrough, and several of those souls can be turned into two different weapons (and one, the Soul of Sif, can be made into <em>three</em>), all of which you need. End result is you need to play through to at least the half-way point of NG++ at a bare minimum to get them all, <em>just</em> to get your 3rd copy of the Soul of Sif and reach the Giant Blacksmith at the end of Anor Londo. But it isn't just boss weapons. Several weapons required for the achievement are also very rarely dropped by enemies. You have to get those too. Which weapons, you ask? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">You'll probably need to look them up.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin</a></em> and its spell-related achievements. You can get every other achievement in the game in one playthrough of the base game if you use a guide, but these four achievements require you to grind ranks in the various covenants; play through all three DLC quests, which aren't required for any other achievement; play through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> to get the four alternate Lord souls to trade for spells; and then play through <em>NG++</em> until you reach Chancellor Welleger, who sells the last two spells you'll need.
</li><li> The fun continues for the Master of Rings achievement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>, which you'll need to reach the endgame of NG++ to complete. Every other achievement, including the spell achievements, can be obtained in one playthrough. (Although the spell achievements still require either covenant grinding or enemy farming, and ranking up enough in the Blades of the Darkmoon covenant can be considered That One Achievement all by itself.)
</li></ul></li><li> "Capell to the Rescue" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteUndiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteUndiscovery">Infinite Undiscovery</a></em>. This achievement requires you to rescue all four Burgess soldiers held prisoner in Castle Prevant within a certain time limit (each soldier gets killed after a certain amount of time has passed, and the timer starts as soon as you enter the castle, so it's already counting down even while you're saving, resting and buying items in the entrance room). Sounds easy, right? Wrong. You cannot waste a <em>single second</em> in order to get this achievement. The first two soldiers are easy, since they die after four minutes and eight minutes respectively, and you can obtain their cell keys shortly after entering the dungeon. The third soldier, however, is the reason this achievement is so nightmarish. He dies <em>nine minutes</em> after you enter the dungeon, and in order to get the cell key to rescue him and the fourth soldier, you have to travel all the way up to the third floor so you can unite with Edward who can craft the key using ingredients you get on the way up there. In order to get there and back in time, you need to be absolutely <em>perfect</em> in your run - skip as many enemies as possible (note that enemies in this game can and will chase you, and are very persistent), not trigger any traps (which is pretty much impossible, since both your allies and enemies can also trigger traps), not let any of your allies get left behind (easier said than done, since they can often get stuck fighting enemies when trying to run past them) and not make a single error.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease">Golden</a></em> has "Hardcore Risette Fan", which requires you to hear 250 unique navigation lines from Rise in one playthrough. There's no tracker for this, and a lot of her lines are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">permanently missable</a> if you either defeat storyline bosses too quickly (her lines explaining their special attacks) or overlevel too much (she has different lines for "weak", "average" and "strong" enemies. If your level is too high, you'll never hear the "strong" ones, and you could even miss the "average" ones too).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>
<ul><li> The original game has an achievement for hearing a certain number of Futaba's lines, which is challenging for the same reasons as the similar trophy for Rise in the previous game. Luckily, many of this game's bosses have unique lines for Futaba, so it's a bit easier to rack up the total number of lines.
</li><li> "Ladies' Man," a Thieves' Guild Award for <em>Royal</em>, requires you to get into a romantic relationship with all ten romanceable Confidants. If you don't want to go the "harem route" or play the game ten times, you'll have to save before getting together with a girl, then reload after completing the romance route to the girl's Confidant, which can be tedious.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">first game</a> has the "_____ Ally" achievements. Each of them requires you to have a particular character in your party for the majority of the game. They're not difficult (although the "Asari Ally" achievement may be a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>)... but getting all six of them requires playing through the <em>entire game</em>, sidequests and all, a minimum of <em>three times</em>. And you need to have the same character(s) in your party for 40-50 missions. They're despised by the fandom not for being challenging, but for being <em>tedious.</em>
<ul><li> Also "Super Power Gamer", which requires you play the entire game and every sidequest to squeak by the level cap at 50, then start a new game on the same career and play the <em>entire</em> game including <em>every</em> sidequest and UNP, to barely squeak by at 60 during the final gauntlet about five kills away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Thankfully adding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLCs</a> gives more margin for "Super Power Gamer": Your first playthrough will end at level 54, and Pinnacle Station will gladly shower you with XP.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> has a pretty nasty one (at least in the PS3 version) in "Insanity" which requires that one beat the game on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Insanity difficulty</a>. This was tough enough on its own, but the true difficulty was due to a nasty glitch. If at any time during your insanity playthrough you loaded a savegame from a lower difficulty (even one belonging to a different character), the game counted it as changing your difficulty and locked you out of the achievement, forcing you to start over. Quite a nasty surprise, getting all the way to the final mission on Insanity only to lose 20+ hours of trophy progress because your roommate played for 15 minutes on Normal.
</li><li> The <em>Arrival</em> DLC also gave us the skull-cracking 'Last Stand'. You have to survive five waves of enemies in a small room with bad cover. Among the enemies are Engineers, which can throw incinerates at you to knock you out of cover, and Pyros, which are fully capable of stunlocking you with their flamethrowers. The soldiers themselves will constantly advance on you, working to knock you out of cover and destroy your shields. Oh, and you have to fight off an YMIR mech at the very end. Good luck getting through this without mastering the intricacies of your chosen class. (Fortunately, the achievement doesn't care if you are using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> character on Casual - and staying near the cafeteria tables forced enemies into a kill zone.)

<ul><li> The <em>real</em> nastiness comes from the Lone Wolf and N7 multiplayer challenges, and by extension, Best of The Best.

Including the one able to hit double-bull (or any other point of the dartboard) with over 90% accuracy, and the guy able to bunk with distance of an inch and completing the minigame without missing a shot (or even on the first one). It's a very long, very hard, very varied endurance test. In a game that's basically a sandbox brawler.

To achieve 100% completion of the voice board, you had to obtain every character, use every possible skill every character could learn, and have every single character obtain high enough relationship values with every other character that they would shout their names upon dying. You can only obtain six optional characters per game. Getting certain characters makes it impossible to get others. The <em>great</em> thing about this, was that some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the later bosses talked</a>, and their voices are part of the collection as well, which means you will have to fight them multiple times, <em>and</em> let them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">call out every attack they have</a>. This means you will have some long battles to go through and hope you could survive at the same time. Playing with one main character means certain characters won't join.

You can get a maximum of 9 points per race if everything pans out (top class {which is randomized}, correctly pick which two bunnies get first and second).

Except for that 1,000,000 Evaluation Points Trophy where you have to walk through dungeons, over and over again just so you can clear out the debris. It would not be so bad, if it weren't for the fact that each dungeon clear you do (includes destroying the gravity core, defeating the boss, and defeating the Lurker) only nets you 3000 evaluation points.

<ul><li> Thankfully Patch 1.9 introduced "Legendary Skills", which lets you revert any skill back to Level 15 (the starting point) so that you can grind out levels again, makes this less of a headache than before.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, "Benevolent Leader" is generally regarded as the game's hardest achievement. First, you need to pour building resources into a settlement until the Size bar changes color. Then at the cost of thousands of Caps, build plenty of higher-level trading, clothing, food &amp; drink, and medical stores, for which you need Rank 2 of the Local Leader perk, itself requiring Charisma of 6, which will need to be even higher to attract more settlers. The final step is patience. Since Happiness tends to decease while the player is away from the settlement, you need to remain there while building it up, periodically sleeping to pass the time. Getting Happiness into the 80s doesn't take too long, but the last stretch from 90 to 100 can be excruciatingly slow. Also, resident NPC's who can't be assigned anywhere tend to drag down Happiness, which is why Sanctuary Hills is a poor choice for this achievement.

The hardest swords to obtain are the Moon Sword, King Block's swords, and the minigame swords (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFriendsAndZoidberg">and hammer</a>).
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Moon Sword</a> isn't too bad to obtain in the English version, as it only involves obtaining all the Key Items (which do nearly nothing and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">incredibly easy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">to miss</a>), but in the Japanese version it involves a <em>brutal</em> amount of requirements, including beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">Those Three Sidequests</a> with the best rewards and viewing all "events", which are easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">permanently missable</a>, and there's no way to keep track of them, unlike Key Items.
</li><li> King Block's swords must be purchased with Small Blocks, which can only be found as rewards, in treasure chests, grinding them off the rarely-appearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Crystal Slime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Blue Dragon</a> at a very low rate, or playing Block Defense Plus for hours <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12qvwd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12qvwd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12qvwd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Tirnaco's Errand, the most popular BDP map to grind on, takes about <em>8 minutes</em> to complete on a good run, and you only get 2 Small Blocks on a perfect clear</span>. <em>88</em> Small Blocks are required to get them all, and only 36 can be found in the main game. Fortunately, the swords and Small Blocks carry over to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> after the 1.01 patch. Crystal Slimes and Blue Dragons are also more common on From Mode, which helps the grinding issue.
</li><li> The three minigame swords are brutal. Blockout is finicky and luck-based enough, but beating it without losing a ball is incredibly difficult. Trying to beat Blockout with a sword that can't spin is next to impossible. Dash Race, even after being made easier (see the page quote), is still challenging, requiring the player to beat winding courses at ridiculous speeds within 25 and 65 seconds for the two courses. On top of that, the EU version wasn't patched, and retains its original difficulty. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense">Block Defense</a> takes a very, <em>very</em> long time to complete even the shortest level and requires a guide to beat perfectly.

<ul><li> Fortunately, for those aiming for "Undefeated", just hitting "reload" instead of "continue" still counts towards earning the trophy, and getting a KO in the Gummi Ship and Olympus Coliseum don't block the trophy.
</li><li> The trophy "Searcher" in the same game requires finding all of Ansem's Report pages. It was easier in the original game, but this time, there are several new pages, and those are only earned by defeating several of the hardest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a>. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestWinnerCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestWinnerCameo">Kurt Zisa</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Mysterious Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Sephiroth</a>.
</li><li> The Gummi Ship Collector trophy, which involves getting every Gummi Ship blueprint in the game. For the majority of obtaining the blueprints, this means fulfilling some truly insane mission requirements traveling between worlds with the Gummi Ship, like doing Atlantica's third mission (do not collect items, and get a high score of 260 points or more), in a minigame widely considered a Scrappy Mechanic prior to its revamp in Kingdom Hearts II.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></em> features Card Master Sora. Which requires Sora to obtain every card in the game. Problems with this one include a sucker punch secret or two. In order to get the cards unlocked to begin with, you'll need to have watched the <em>358Days/2</em> movies. Then, you will have needed to complete the game AND the Reverse/Rebirth story with Riku. Only to have to get all the cards all over again in a new Sora story. This isn't challenging as it is tedious. You'll also have to go and get all the enemy cards as well, which barely drop unless you use the rooms with the tougher heartless. Compounding this, is that all the hidden cards you need to obtain are in the key to rewards rooms; so you have to meet the criterion for each card multiple times, and then find the key to rewards card. Each room has roughly three treasures per world.

Also, unlike in <em>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix HD</em>, all of the blueprints are obtainable by playing the regular Gummi missions. The last blueprint was still held by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Hunter-X</a>, however.

The worst part is the "special menu", where every dish requires at least one ingredient that can only be obtained from Flantastic Seven minigames, many of which are equally annoying. Run out of ingredients on those dishes? Have fun going back and re-doing the flan minigames for more! However, the inclusion of EZ Codes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Re Mind</a></em> allows players to automatically get an "Excellent" rating no matter what, with the only drawback being that players still have to get every ingredient to begin with, provided they haven't created a save file with the Premium Menu.

<ul><li> Win a battle with a Shy Guy Airtub, Shy Guy, Pi'illodactyl, Shy Guy Airtub R, Shy Guy R or Pi'illodactyl R without getting hit by it. There's a challenge for each of these, unfortunately they only appear at complete random in the background during other enemy battles and have some difficult to avoid attacks. Thankfully, you don't have to kill the Shy Guy Airtubs or Pi'illodactyls, since they attack from the background; dodging that attack and then beating the normal mooks clears the challenge. Unfortunately, the normal Shy Guys do have to be physically defeated to win their challenge.
</li><li> Dodge Ten challenges in Wakeport, Dreamy Wakeport, Somnom Woods and Neo Bowser Castle. They have a ton of hard to dodge enemies, and you have to dodge ten attacks from any of said enemies without taking a single hit in the process. Especially bad in Wakeport, since only Hermite Crabs really appear as enemies, and they're already annoying to dodge as is. So 'dodge ten enemies in Wakeport' is basically 'dodge ten attacks by Hermite Crabs'.
</li><li> Win a battle with a Hermite Crab, Beehoss or another tough enemy without getting hit by it. Nothing more annoying than having to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> against the games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Bats</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> with the extra corollary that they have to get the chance to attack you in the process.
</li><li> Get an Excellent on Luiginary Wall. Luiginary Wall is the most difficult and easy-to-mess up Luiginary Attack in the game. Either you'll fail to connect enough hits to count as an Excellent before everything is killed, you'll fail to rebound the spinning Luigi, or the spinning Luigi will go through a gap in the Wall. Everything can and will go wrong here.
</li><li> Getting an Excellent on Luiginary Tornado. The number of hits that need to be delivered to enemies generally requires superhuman levels of Button Mashing on a very large group of enemies.

<ul><li> Paper Sombrero Guy Dodge - dodge five Paper Sombrero Guy attacks in a row. This one is annoying for four reasons. One: Paper Sombrero Guy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a> that randomly appears alongside other enemies when you enter battle - they don't appear in the field, meaning you have to keep getting into battles until you get lucky enough to find one. Two: Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a>, they have a high chance of running away when it comes to their turn. Three: They only have one actual offensive attack, which they use least often - usually they'll either buff the other enemies, or just run. Four: Said offensive attack is incredibly difficult to dodge. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> is highly recommended for this achievement.
</li><li> Paper Boomerang Bro Dodge - dodging five Paper Boomerang attacks in a row. They only have two attacks and one of them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> so you will be seeing it a lot.
</li><li> Expert Toad Trail, Expert Bomb Derby, Expert Trio Meteor and Expert Mega Thwonk - get Excellent on the respective attacks five times in a row. They may be the hardest Bros. Attacks in the game to get an Excellent on, due to the very difficult controls.

</li><li> Getting an S Rank on the latter Boss Battle Ring Battles. These battles can be difficult enough trying to do normally but getting an S Rank often means doing the battles almost perfectly.
</li><li> Getting an S Rank in Trio Racket Attackathon. Paradoxically for the first attack in the sidequest, it might be the hardest because there is no room for error and the targets can mess up the ball speed or make it invisible.

Getting even <em>one</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, and even if you do know how, obtaining it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> on its own.

The quickest and easiest way to do this without the DLC is to keep killing Clione, an enemy with high HP and defense, restoring health on every turn, over and over, because it drops a lot of credits. Which, with the right equipment and attacks used, isn't as hard as much as it's just tiring to do over and over. Also, just getting the dungeon containing this enemy in the first place requires several rounds of dungeon crafting from random boss-fight drops... With the DLC packs (which lets you go beyond level 99) it's slightly faster and more varied, but still grindy - after you reach certain levels you can safely start fighting stronger versions of the same enemy dropping more coins, and eventually move on to even higher-leveled "tournament" fights with higher payoff... still doing this over and over.

<ul><li> There are a series of "Annihilator" achievements for killing 100 of a certain enemy species. The nastiest ones are Yggralith Annihilator and Telethia Annihilator. The only consistently-spawning Telethia and Yggralith are the game's strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a>. Good luck with that.
</li><li> "The Geek" requires you to obtain all <em>453</em> holofigures. That means completing every mission, filling out the entire Collectopedia, and worst of all, <em>defeating every Tyrant</em> (with a few exceptions). By the way, holofigures only drop from silver drops, so if you have any Treasure Sensor augments or Reclaimer division support, there's a chance you may not get the holofigure. The hardest holofigures to get are the Yggralith and Phanatos holofigures. Yggralith Zero only appears for a day or two every other week, and you have to survive an eight-minute fight with it to get a chance at obtaining the holofigure. Phanatos, the Netherlord is exclusive to a Squad Mission, which itself is only unlocked by completing an optional objective in another mission. If someone beats that mission without completing the optional objective, your only choice is to find another squad and pray that the set of tasks that unlock it is running. And even if you beat that mission, it's no guarantee that you'll get the holofigure. For the icing on the cake, those two enemies are online-only, so you're screwed if you can't get online, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">you know what'll happen eventually...</a>
</li><li> "A True Hero" requires you to deliver the final blow to a Global Nemesis. Of the Global Nemeses, one spawns about once a week, while the other one spawns about every other week, and both only stick around for a few hours at most due to groups ravenously whittling down their health. The Nemeses being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">all-server-wide raid bosses</a> means that it will take a while for their RP to reach zero, at which point depleting their health will kill them and reward the achievement. The problem? You have an <em>extremely</em> narrow window of opportunity to do this. A few minutes too late, and the Nemesis is gone. A few too early, and it still has a few thousand RP left. You can try to cheese it by pausing with the home button and waiting a while so the zero-RP Nemesis stays active a little longer for you, but you risk being disconnected.

<ul><li> In both games, the Achievement for getting every chest in the game. There are a lot of locations you only visit once, so it's easy to miss out on a few. This includes monster chests, and the final dungeons have some pretty nasty ones. Also, the Achievement requires you to not only open each chest, but examine them again for their "chest phrase". It's easy to forget to do this...
</li><li> FC has "Preemptive Powerhouse", which requires you to defeat 2nd Lieutenant Lorence in your second encounter with him, a fight the game doesn't expect you to win. Even with the right setup, it's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">a heavily luck-based fight</a>. Defeating Lorence is also required for getting maximum BP in that story mission, meaning that if you're going for all sidequests, you still need to win the fight for the "In Justice We Trust" Achievement.
</li><li> SC has "Breakfast Safari", for being a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>. The description says to find "Bacon", "Eggs" and "Golden Toast". It fails to inform you that they're <strong>pigeons</strong>, some of which can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">permanently missed</a>. And all pigeons look identical, and fly away if you run near them.
</li><li> "Odyssey of Anton", also from SC, requires you to find and talk to one specific NPC at multiple points through the story, all of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>. And some of Anton's appearances require long backtracks to obscure areas, and sometimes he changes his dialogue within a short span of time.
</li><li> "Ramblin' Gambler" in SC. It first requires you to get all 14 Gambler Jack books, most of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>. But on top of that, you also have to get a 21 in Blackjack (not too difficult) and <em>a 4 of a kind in Poker</em> (<em>very</em> difficult, that's a less than 1/1000 hand) in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettingMinigame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettingMinigame">Betting Minigame</a>. There are reports of players spending as long as 11 hours trying to get this.
</li><li> <em>The 3rd</em> has Fierce Fighter and Flighty Fighter. The former requires you to have won at least 300 battles and never fled from a single battle. The latter requires you to run from at least 300 battles. As if those restrictions weren't bad enough, there are several more: you can only get ONE of these achievements per playthrough, only get them near the end of the game (making Fierce Fighter more of a pain), you have to win 400 battles to open one of the Star Doors (escaped fights do not count) if you want 100% completion (making Flighty Fighter more of a pain), and to top it all off, the spot you need to examine to get either of these achievements is not all that obvious, meaning players without a guide might just miss it entirely. Fierce Fighter in particular is made even more difficult due to the dark rooms in Grimsel Fortress during Chapter 4. If you encounter an enemy but no one has the Night Goggles accessory equipped, then every action except Flee becomes disabled. The problem comes from the fact that players can't get access to a copy of the Night Goggles accessory <em>before</em> the dark rooms, but instead must traverse two dark rooms without encountering any monsters before they come across the room that contains the chest for the Night Goggles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em>: The second one has this one achievement, <em>Honor Roll</em>, that requires you to achieve A0 rank. Achieving that rank means missing out no more than 10APs in a playthrough. It's particularly tough since some of the APs are achieved through extra requirements that must be met during boss battles, some which are downright devilish (e.g. vs Altina and Bleublanc, where you need to fall <em>both</em> within 40 turns &mdash; not tough on its own if it wasn't for Altina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a>) while others are complete luck-based missions (the battle against Rufus, which is a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> since you need to half his HP before he kills you &mdash; and he <em>can</em> kill you before the battle even starts if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> is feeling particularly malicious, e.g. granting him a zero arts and letting him have the first move, and then he takes up the offer. Or the battle against Duvalie and McBurn, which the latter <em>can</em> use his S-Break in the first turn, again killing your party before the fight even begins, or even delay you indefinitely, making the entire battle one hapless cinematic).
<ul><li> In both games, the trophy for opening every chest in the game. Miss a single chest in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTimeDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTimeDungeon">One-Time Dungeon</a> (of which there are <em>many</em>, with the exception of the non-prologue schoolhouse levels, <em>every</em> dungeon in the first game is one)? Have fun doing <em>another playthrough</em> to get the trophy! The second game isn't <em>quite</em> as bad because you get an airship that allows you to revisit most locations, but there are still a few that can be gotchas.
</li><li> A number of achievements in both games are this. Often you'll find yourself replaying the game <em>several</em> times if just to get every single Master Quartz in the game (which is not possible with just one playthrough), cook every single recipe in the game, complete every single quest in the game (Aidios help you if you miss a hidden quest or couldn't complete the optional ones due to poor planning/bad foresight), or even scan every single monster in the game thoroughly (forgot to stock up on battle scopes or bring a party member with a scan spell/craft? Time to reload the last save from when you're still at the last town). There's also the bonding trophies. Any individual trophy is fairly easy to get (Get link level to a certain amount, participate in at least one bonding event in the last chapter, then select that character for a special event just before the climax), but there's one for every party member except some temporary guest members, and there literally are not enough bonding events for everyone in one playthrough, so getting them all requires beating the game multiple times. In addition, since the final event to trigger the achievement can only be done once before the story progresses, getting all the ones a player is capable of unlocking in a given playthrough involves, selecting one character, playing through the event until the achivement comes up, then restarting the game, reloading a save from just before the selection point, and doing it again, and so on until all options have been exhausted, which gets irritating after half a dozen run-throughs.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series has the "crown" awards. If you hunt a large monster that's significantly smaller or larger than normal, its size is registered in the Monster List as a gold crown or a silver crown if the monster was above-average. These awards require you to do this for <em>every</em> large monster save the ones with fixed size. They combine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Last Lousy Point</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> to the extreme. Keep in mind that some Elder Dragons are part of the list, as are all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Deviants</a>. Some event quests give monsters with fixed crown-sizes or have a higher chance to spawn crown-sized monsters, but you're out of luck for the rest. <em>Generations Ultimate</em> has the hardest version, as there are total of <strong>83</strong> eligible large monsters. <em>4</em> (<em>Ultimate</em>) and <em>Generations</em> (<em>Ultimate</em>) at least accept silver crowns for the large-size award, but <em>3</em> (<em>Ultimate</em>) and <em>World</em> do not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> has one in each game.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has the "Blight-Queller" achievement, earned by killing 1,000 darkspawn. This one has an unfortunate tendency to be bugged on consoles, meaning that the player cannot unlock it no matter how many enemies they kill. (PC players don't get their 100% completion trophy with ease either, however, because the PC version of the game has several achievements which do not exist on the console versions.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> has the "Supplier" achievement, which is an unusually egregious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> because <em>the game</em> gets it wrong. According to the description of the achievement, it's unlocked by finding every variety of crafting resource; however, it's really unlocked by finding every single instance of every single resource. It's made a little easier if the <em>Black Emporium</em> DLC has been installed, because the player can purchase resources they missed in the first two acts, but any which are missed in the third act are out of reach. Both the official strategy guide and the wiki are only partially helpful, which means that reaching the achievement basically requires careful attention to a walkthrough. It's quite often the last one standing between a player and that coveted 100% trophy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> has the "Belle of the Ball" trophy, which requires you to get the maximum approval of the Orlesian court during one of the main quests. It's easier said than done because it's a massive conglomeration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang Its</a>. Right from the start you're docked at least 10 points (out of 100, with a default starting value of 40) if your Inquisitor is not human or is a mage. Additional points are obtained by tossing certain collectible coins in the fountain or collecting blackmail material for Leliana. A lot of the blackmail material can be found behind magically sealed doors that can be opened by Halla statues which can be found around the palace. There are, naturally, more doors than there are Halla statues to open them. Oh, and if you venture into any area of the Winter Palace that isn't dedicated to the party (which is where most of the coins, Halla statues, and blackmail information are found), you'll slowly lose points. And if you don't get to 100 approval before a certain point in the quest, you don't get the trophy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueReflection">Blue Reflection</a></em>: "The Extreme MASTER of the Master of the Dark" requires you to clear the Dark Cave smartphone game in a very counter-intuitive manner. You need to build up the three main stats to the max of five at least once, then reduce them to one or less by the final growth period, all within the ten turn limit. And if your monster doesn't evolve three times by then, which only happens at certain points depending on your progress, you can get locked out and have to try again with the next monster. The fact that it's a gold trophy only adds to the frustration.

Why does this one stand out so much? Because it explicitly requires non-arrange Black Label mode. You have to be on Rank 999, take NO damage up to Tyrannosatan (while also beating Rank 999 Ice Palace and Gorge, in that order), and beat Tyrannosatan on your first credit. This achievement is the bane of many people on BOTH sides of the pacific ocean aiming to get 100% on the game.
<ul><li> The sequel has the 6 billion point achievement, which isn't quite as hard but does require the player to have figured out the mechanics of the scoring system and memorized the timings of when to enter super mode.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps">Naval Ops</a></em> series gives out rewards for sinking 999 of each category of ship (submarines, battleships, etc.). In each game, battlecarriers only appear in small numbers in one or two missions. Superweapons also only appear one or two at a time, but turn up in larger numbers over the course of a campaign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> has Fector's Challenge, which requires you to complete the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameWithinAGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameWithinAGame">Game Within a Game</a> "Journey of the Prairie King" without dying even once. Every other achievement in the game is well within reach for any player as long as you're willing to put in a little time; Fector's Challenge is, by comparison, an enormous ask.
</li><li> There are various achievements in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SurgeonSimulator2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SurgeonSimulator2013">Surgeon Simulator 2013</a></em> that qualify, but here are the ones that take the cake:
<ul><li> "Nothing But Skull". As the description says, you have to throw the replacement brain into the patient's head to finish the brain transplant. What it DOESN'T tell you is that you have to throw it from a specific place (your hand all the way to the back) and in a specific manner (turning the hand up and letting go of the brain so that it flies upwards). This is difficult to accomplish even if you know how to do it. It's the third least acquired achievement for a very good reason.
</li><li> All the time trials for kidney transplants. Not only is it extremely difficult to remove the old kidneys, placing the replacements in a way that triggers the win condition requires a great deal of patience.
</li><li> "Best Surgeon In The World". Get perfect scores on all operations, which requires your patients losing as little blood as possible and completing the operations in reasonably short time. Good luck accomplishing that in the ambulance and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">space</span> ones...
</li><li> "Best Surgeon In The Universe". You must successfully complete all of the 6 secret operations <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on an alien</span>. The operations are chosen randomly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">you aren't informed which organ is which</a>, and as if that wasn't enough, one of the missions is bugged (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">requires replacing different organ than you are told</a>) and another not only cannot be completed without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">electrocuting yourself</a>, but you also have to make sure that after you smash the container with the replacement organ, you can actually catch it before it floats away.
</li><li> "Call Trisha". Shortly saying, you have to type in a number on a phone. Sound simple, right? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Not with this game's controls...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X3: Terran Conflict</a></em> has the achievement "Resourceful" for completing the Hub quest line. Which takes weeks of real time grinding just to get the resources needed for it. Not to mention the credits needed to afford the factories needed to manufacturer those resources. Plus this quest line is needed before you can complete several other quest lines for their achievements. Top it off with the ultimate achievement, "Die-Hard," which requires completing all nine quest lines in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">Dead is Dead</a> mode.
<ul><li> Also in ''Terran Conflict, you get "Reboot" for successfully boarding and capturing a Xenon "Q" frigate &mdash; a task that requires massive amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>. To explain: First you need to train up about an entire army company of 5-star marines, and the only way to train their combat skill is by boarding ships, which can result in casualties. Then when you go to board the Q, you have to keep sending in more marines to bolster their thinning ranks, because on Xenon ships <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">if less than 18 marines remain when they go to hack the computer core, the boarding attempt fails automatically</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Tower of Babel" achievement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VisceraCleanupDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VisceraCleanupDetail">Viscera Cleanup Detail</a>: Santa's Rampage</em>, where you must stack 10 stools on top of each other. The thing is, the physics engine will <em>always</em> make sure the tower of stools topple over when you put the 9th on.
<ul><li> Also from <em>Santa's Rampage</em> is "Christmas Crisis Corrected" which requires a 100% cleaning of the map without damaging any of the Christmas-themed items. As most of the Christmas items are safe barring a TNT explosion or incineration this would be easy if not for the glass ornaments. The slightest disturbance can knock them free and they will shatter if they hit the ground on their own. This makes cleaning blood stains and soot near them a nightmare, especially as there's no indication if one breaks, rendering hours of work pointless. This is made worse by the bucket machine sometimes dispensing <em>lit TNT</em>. Hope you saved your game!
</li><li> From the main game is "Helping Hand" which requires receiving a certain number of dismembered hands from a malfunctioning vending machine. The issue is that the malfunction is not overly common and even then the hand is one of several items that can spawn. As a result the achievement is best completed by just activating the machine constantly and waiting for the RNG.
</li></ul></li><li> "I'm the Worst!" from <em>Mad Games Tycoon</em>. To get it, you have to win worst game of the year anytime. The problem is, this achievement is <em>embarrassing</em> to have in your achievements list, especially if this is your first one.
<ul><li> "I'm the Best!" requires that you win best game of the year. The problem is, it's <em>really hard</em> to do that. Hope you made a really good game!
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Hay Day</em> has the achievements "Turbo Trucker II" and "Turbo Trucker III", which require you to fill, respectively, 20 and 30 truck orders in the span of 30 minutes. This timespan doesn't give you any time to make items on the spot, so you have to fill your barn ahead of time with as many unique items as possible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">hoping the orders don't ask for something you don't have</a> (and they almost always ask for multiple items). If you're trying for this achievement and run into an impossible order, you can delete it...but it takes from 6 to 30 minutes depending on your level for a new order to replace it (but even at Level 48, the replacement time is still 30 minutes). So, depending on your level, you could have only one shot to fulfill each replacement order. Or zero shots.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory">Poker Night at the Inventory</a></em> has an achievement for getting a straight flush. Naturally only 2.1% of all people who own the game have this achievement. The odds of getting a straight flush in any given hand are <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pokerjesusonline.com/hand_probabilities.htm">slightly above 1 in 100,000<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The "Beating Tough Competition" achievement from <em>NHL 08</em> requires playing (and beating) one of the Top 50 ranked players on the game's servers. Not only is this a ridiculous feat in itself (as anyone who's gotten to that point has likely mastered the game), and not only is it nigh-impossible to randomly be paired up with a Top 50 player, but (according to reports) hordes of players spam the inboxes of the Top 50 players asking if they can beat them to earn the achievement, which means they likely won't play you voluntarily. As of 2011, the achievement is also unobtainable (as the servers were shut down).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RumbleRoses">Rumble Roses XX</a></em> has a couple of really terrible ones for getting all of the costumes, and buying all of the items from the shop. <a class="urllink" href="http://howlongtobeat.com/gamebreakdown.php?gamename=Rumble%20Roses%20XX">It would appear that some<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> can unlock everything in 30 hours. Due to the requirements for said Achievements being ridiculously specific, it can take up to <em>200 hours</em> to unlock everything.
</li><li> Nearly all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a> Xtreme 2</em>'s achievements are based on collecting every swimsuit for all nine girls. While they're obtainable with copious amounts of tedious grinding (with some possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a>), the crown jewel achievement has to be the "Complete Item Collection" achievement; not only does every girl need every single swimsuit in every girl's collection, but every accessory, knicknack, volleyball, jet ski, and other miscellaneous items, some of which require sheer luck to get.
</li><li> Several achievements in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager">Football Manager</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The "National Hero" achievement that involves taking a team in the nation's lowest division and reaching the top division. This a test of both skill and time, because in nations with several lower divisions (such as England) it can easily take around 10 seasons to reach the first division. By the way, to the game, "reaching the top division" means <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">winning each lower division league</a></em> - promotion is not enough.
</li><li> Not conceding goals in multiple matches in a row. "Immovable Object" requires your team to not concede goals in <em><strong>30</strong></em> matches in a row - most real-life records of not conceding goals reach up to 10 matches in a row at most, so good luck doing that without a customized database with overpowered players. "Outstanding Defense" is another achievement that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">only</a> requires 20 matches in a row without conceding, but less than 1% of players have obtained it. "Parked the Tank" is a much more reasonable achievement that requires 10 matches in a row without conceding, but still less than 10% of players have obtained it.
</li><li> Achievements that imply playing the game for a very long time. Take the likes of "Club Legend" (stay on a single team for 20 seasons), "Immortality" (gain 20 Manager of the Year awards - which means 20 seasons of gameplay a least) or "Value for Money" (reach 30 seasons of gameplay)
</li><li> "On top of the World" requires winning the World Cup. Since the cup is only played every 4 seasons, you are generally required to manage a strong team in the nation you are going to compete with, because you otherwise have no control on whether your team is even going to have a chance to win the World Cup. And even then, you may require some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>.
</li><li> "Double hat-trick"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14jgga');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14jgga" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14jgga');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(removed in Football Manager 2018)</span> requires a player scoring 6 goals in a single match. Good luck doing so in a game where you don't control your own players - it's infuriatingly common that a player scores 5 goals in a match and then fails to score a sixth no matter how much time he has left.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>

<ul><li> Getting the Kerotan emblem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3">Metal Gear Solid 3</a></em> involves you trying to find and shoot <em>all</em> of the Kerotans (the frog toys scattered all over the jungle, except in the 3DS port, in which they are replaced with Yoshi toys). It is very easy to miss some of them, <em>especially</em> during the motorcycle chase sequence.
</li><li> The majority of the achievements for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> are easy enough to get, but there are two which are absolutely brutal. The first is "Great Dane" for getting every dog tag. Getting the dog tags themselves is simple enough, just requiring you to stick up certain guards throughout the game, but this is no mere collectible achievement; the dog tags are actually spread over every difficulty, and you have to complete the game on each difficulty for the tags to be officially collected. Whilst you only have to get the dog tags on the Plant chapter despite what the description says, that still means a grand total of five playthroughs to do, and yes, you'll have to beat the bosses on every one of them. Have fun getting killed by those bosses over and over on Hard and Expert! However, "Great Dane" pales in comparison to the aptly named "Virtually Impossible" for completing every single VR mission. There are hundreds of these, split into several characters, and they start off ridiculously easy; simple sneaking missions, target practice and elimination missions. By the time you've got to the final category, MGS1 Snake, you'll need to have some serious skills, as every single mission is a bastard to beat. Especially that bloody Zako Survival mission...
</li><li> The Trials Achievements are almost insane in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em>. PS3 users got off luckier, since they're DLC, and as such aren't required for a Platinum trophy. Special mention has to go to Bonfires, a luck-based mission from hell which has a special challenge achievement, an infuriating time run trial and an even more infuriating time run trial, all of which are needed to complete the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedI">Assassin's Creed I</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">Those flags</a>...

While the flags were given map icons to make them easier to find, the 100 feathers that were added did not. It wasn't until <em>Brotherhood</em> that they added a treasure map for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIV">Assassins Creed IV</a></em>: The "Blackbeard's Wrath" DLC adds the "Sacred Land" achievement, requiring you to get first place in the team-based Domination mode, with a specific character model. There are so many variables involved that all but the most skilled players will find it nigh impossible to get without sympathetic teammates...and opponents!

<ul><li> Getting all three medals for "Nests Destroyed" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</a></em>. There's only one "Nest" in the game: Owl's Nest, Caulder's base. You destroy that in the final mission, "Sunrise". So to get these medals, you have to complete "Sunrise" <em>ten times</em>. Did we forget to mention "Sunrise" is one of the most hated levels in the game?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> II</em>:
<ul><li> There are achievements, for each faction, for winning a ranked game with all three of that faction's heroes on your team. Unless you have excellent coordination between multiple friends, these come down to playing game after game as one faction and hoping for the best.
</li><li> <em>Retribution</em> has "Winning Rush", which requires winning five online, ranked games <em>in a row</em>, which more often comes down to sheer luck. What's more, the achievement's description doesn't even hint that those 5 wins must be with the same race. There is also an achievement for beating the campaign on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Very Hard</a> difficulty, which makes your troops not much better than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, turns every boss into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, and even the tutorial mission will mess you up if you aren't careful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice">Disgaea 3</a></em>
<ul><li> The pirate-hunting trophies in the PS3 release are completely dependent on the random number generator. Most pirate crews appear with regularity but then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">Prinny</a> Pirates... Gah. Tellingly, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease">Vita version</a> came out, the pirate trophies were all replaced.
</li><li> Similar to the above, there is a trophy for finding Axel in the Item World. It is also completely random, but unlike the pirate trophies this one was kept in the re-release. Joyous.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Demonic Streak" achievement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElibianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElibianNights">Elibian Nights</a></em> requires you to win a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a> fight in Karel's tale. The character you have is outclassed in every way by this boss, and said boss also carries the Iron Rune, making it impossible to land a Critical Hit on him. (You can potentially get a Rune of your own, but that really doesn't change anything; he can still kick your ass.) Also, if you've used up your one Elixir by now (as this boss fight occurs in one of the last legs of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a>), then you have no chance of winning as the boss is able to out-damage Karel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you <em>do</em> win, you get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> anyway, along with the achievement.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive">Paradox Interactive</a> titles:
<ul><li> As of the <em>Sons of Abraham</em> DLC, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a> 2</em> has "The One Who Brings Benefit" and "Kingdom of David". The former involves recreating the Persian Empire as a Zoroastrian ruler and the latter involves recreating the kingdom of Israel under a Jewish ruler. Both necessitate starting off as a weak duchy or county surrounded by hostile Muslim and Tengri rulers who outnumber you badly and can use either Holy War or invasion to take most of your provinces in one fell swoop. Oh, and if you take too long, you're directly in the path of every invading eastern horde from the Seljuks onward. Neither achievement is as insanely difficult as the Europa Universalis 4 example listed above, but getting either takes a lot of patience and luck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Three Mountains" requires the player to conquer the entire world as the Ryukyu Islands. Note that conquering the entire world is already very difficult, even if you start the game as one of the stronger nations. Doing it with the tiny Ryukyu Islands is unreasonable by any standards and the whole achievement would just be a joke... but at least one dedicated player achieved it, even posting a step-by-step guide as he did on the forums. The developers apparently were taking notes, as they patched all of the exploits that made achieving the achievement possible soon afterward. That said, there is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">Easy Level Trick</a> for this (well, "easy" in that it still works)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5wg3n');"><sup>Short version&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5wg3n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5wg3n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The game considers vassal states "conquered" and a Shogun has an easy time controlling vassals. As Ryukyu, ally with Ming China and have them help you execute a surgical strike on Kyoto. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Reload until it works</a>, declare your ruler Shogun, then have all your Japanese Daimyo vassals follow you to war, swarm a target and make it another vassal. Repeat and snowball.</span>.
</li><li> Arguably this might not even be the hardest achievement. Other 'impossibles' include starting as the Aztecs and conquering Europe (very hard due to the huge disparity in technology); starting as Najd (a small Muslim nation), and conquering (almost) the entire world and converting it to Sunni Islam.
</li><li> Made worse by the fact that, prior to the 1.12 patch, several achievements had inaccurate descriptions of how to earn them. The Najd achievement above(Najd Jihad) used to say "As Najd, conquer Europe, Africa, and Asia and convert them to Sunni Islam." The actual requirement is having 500 Sunni provinces on any continent. Far from easy, but certainly easier.

<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">Outside Context</a>" requires you to invade Earth during the middle of a world war. The problem is, there's no guarantee the Sol system will spawn in a given galaxy, and if it does, it's just as likely for your empire to find it as a medieval society, early space-faring culture, or post-apocalyptic wasteland than it is for it to be discovered while it's undergoing a global conflict. Even if you find the right kind of Earth, you have to send in a constructor ship to claim the system before one of your rivals can, then get an invasion force on the ground before the natives decide to end the war in a nuclear exchange that reduces Earth to a Tomb World.
</li><li> "Queening" (capture a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Prethoryn Queen</a>) requires you to be strong enough to defeat the Prethoryn Scourge crisis, but then refrain from finishing it off for over 800 months game-time until a wounded Queen spawns that gives you a project to capture it. Strategy guides to unlock the achievement suggest parking your fleets in the last remaining Scourge system, cranking the game speed up to Very Fast, and getting a sandwich.
</li><li> "Last, Best Hope" requires you to lead the Non-Aligned Powers to victory during the War in Heaven event, which only happens when two Fallen Empires (the second-most powerful forces in the game, after the endgame Crisis factions) fully Awaken and go to war with each other. So not only is there a virtual dice roll to see if both Fallen Empires decide to Awaken one after the other and declare their rivalry, you also have to be sufficiently well-respected by the normal empires in the galaxy for them to ask you to <em>lead</em> their coalition instead of merely joining it, <em>and</em> you have to be strong enough to take down two Awakened Empires before they do enough damage to your allies to convince them to surrender.
</li><li> "Stay on Target" requires you to destroy another empire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Colossus</a> superweapon before it finishes firing on one of your planets. Not starts, <em>finishes</em> - a Colossus is unarmed and will flee a hostile fleet, so to get this achievement you have to let an enemy fleet invade your territory, wait for the Colossus to finish the month-long charging process and commit to firing its superweapon, and then send in your fleet to defeat the enemy escorts and blow up their Colossus before it completes the destruction of your world. And this has only gotten harder after a patch drastically reduced the Colossus' firing time.
</li><li> "Inscrutable Power" is one of the rarest achievements, since it requires the player to get the Galatron, which has a 0.5% chance of being inside a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LootBoxes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LootBoxes">Reliquary</a> sold by the Caravaneer Fleets wandering the galaxy. <em>The</em> rarest achievement is "Raiders of the Lost Galatron," which requires another empire to get the thing, then for you to use the "Take Galatron" casus belli to steal it.

</li><li> "Outstanding Resume" requires you to complete 30 missions in a single game - a very tedious thing to do unless you have a cooperative human ally.
</li><li> "Pilot's Bane" requires you to destroy 2500 strikecraft in a single game. In an average game, you'd be lucky to destroy a few hundred.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpaceHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpaceHulk">Space Hulk</a></em> has "There is only war!", which requires the player to kill 40,000 enemies (an obvious riff on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">source material</a>). A complete playthrough of the main campaign can easily run well under 1,000 kills.
</li><li> <em>Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters</em>:
<ul><li> "Does Anybody Want To Play Parcheesi?" requires you to get <em>50</em> wins on the Hypernatural minigame present in the game. Like the main game itself, Hypernatural is turn-based and requires you to hunt a specific ghost. Unlike the main game, the ghosts are <em>permanently</em> invisible, with the only hint you're near one not telling you how close it is or what type of panel it's on. You also aren't told which one is the one you're supposed to defeat, meaning you could spend the entire time chasing one ghost that you know the vague location of before finding out that no, it's not the one you need to win. To make matters worse, it's not enough that the human team (which you're always on) wins. It needs to be <em>you</em> that defeats the target ghost or it won't count. Additionally, good luck playing it without looking up how to, since the rules don't do anywhere near a good enough job explaining how to play.
</li><li> Also related to Hypernatural, there's "He Slimed Me", which requires the ghost to win. It sounds easy enough, but it's an exercise in frustration in practice. Your allies are strangely competent, while the ghost player will often avoid attacking humans if they manage to get a hit in on the ghost, even if the hit does zero damage. The only thing that makes this remotely tolerable is that you'll likely get it during the hundreds of games you play trying to win 50 of them. Also, due to the rules of Hypernatural, the game has a 25/33/50% chance of ending once the target ghost is defeated, which can turn what looks like a loss into a victory.

To get it you have to literally be the #1 ranked player in the world.
</li><li> After the backlash over the above achievement, the developers showed their sense of humor by including in the next game in the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarRomeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarRomeII">Total War: Rome II</a></em>, an achievement for recruiting a unit of Elephants (supposedly only recruitable in Syria and North Africa) in the Alps. It's aptly named 'I Will Find A Way Or Make One'. However, the community never figured out how to do it. With the first patch it was changed to the much easier to obtain 'As Carthage, recruit a unit of elephants.'
</li><li> Similar to the above, <em>Rome II</em> has an achievement for the unlikely event of winning the Grand Campaign without losing any battles or ever autoresolving.

Heart Bomb is a highly telegraphed ability with a small blast radius that most enemies will easily scatter and escape from with very few ways of keeping enemies in position to hit more than one.

Radiant Glory heals Achilles for each enemy God or minion he hits with an ability, and his abilities have decent AOEs to take advantage of this, with one of his abilities being capable of being cast twice before going on cooldown. The problem is that Radiant Glory can only heal a maximum of 4 times per ability, and the aforementioned second cast can only be used if the ability hits a god, which heavily limits the amount of opportunities a player has to go for the achievement. Particularly notable is that while <em>The Crowd Cheers</em> is not the achievement with the lowest completion percentage, all of the achievements with lower completion percentages are from gods who were released considerably later than Achilles, with the earliest one added to the game nearly a year and a half later.

Aside from lowered ammunition per drop, stronger enemies and taking more damage, all checkpoints are disabled. If you die, you have to reload from your last save file. This doesn't sound so bad... until you realize that you are allowed to save three times total throughout the entire game. This can easily lead to hours of lost progress due to even a slight mishap.
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> has a frustrating one in 'Don't get cocky, kid', which requires you to survive Chapter 4's turret section with more than 50% hull integrity remaining. This one has driven many players to frustration, given the somewhat wonky turret controls and the random spawning of the asteroids. For added fun, no matter what difficulty level you are on you automatically start at 85% hull integrity. Victory generally requires very steady nerves, firing single shots with both barrels so as not to overheat, and praying that the asteroids spawn in an easy pattern.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadIsland">Dead Island</a></em> has the "Oh No You Don't" achievement. To get it you have to kill a Ram with a tackle. Despite sounding simple, it is probably the hardest achievement in the game unless you use a guide. In order to obtain it you have to first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">play as Sam B. since he is the only character who even gets the tackle skill.</a> Then, you have to whittle a Ram's health down without killing it some other way or you'll have to find another. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Lastly, this is a secret achievement, which means the game gives you ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE that you need to do this!</a> You either get extremely lucky and discover it by accident or find out about it from an online guide.

Each of them has something that qualifies them: Night Life in Bright Falls is the longest, Run On Sentence has the toughest combat sections, and No Punctuation has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">platforming sections</a> (though mercifully, they are all near the start).

No problem, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Outlast">Outlast</a></em> and its DLC, <em>Whistleblower</em>, have similar achievements. Except those games were roughly an hour long each, whereas <em>Outlast 2</em> will take you, at minimum, three hours. That's three straight hours in which you need to play the game perfectly and a single hit from any major enemy (or minor enemy, as the delay between attacks is punishingly tiny) will permanently end your run. Not to mention that while the game isn't riddled with bugs, it's not uncommon for enemies to simply get stuck standing in corridors that you <em>need</em> to go through, essentially dooming your run with bad luck. And if that's not enough, there's another achievement, 'Messiah' for doing this <em>without ever reloading the battery in your camcorder</em>, meaning you'll be doing most of this in the dark. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Have fun</a>!

</li><li> While <em>Defense Grid 2</em> has far fewer achievements in general than the first game and none of the really insanely hard ones, it does have one particularly annoying one to get- "Master Strategist", which requires you to get <em>100 Gold medals.</em> While Gold medals are much, <em>much</em> easier to get than in the original, the game simply isn't all that long and you will probably have met the requirements to unlock every other achievement (the second hardest, "Xenocide", requires you to kill 50,000 aliens, which will still take a fair amount of grind) while only having had to play enough missions to earn maybe <em>half</em> of that many, if that.

The player competes in air hockey against each of the five boyfriends, using the mouse to move their striker around, and the first to get a total of 7 points wins the game. The problem came about because the Steam version of the mini-game tended to lag <em>horrendously</em>!! Searching the Steam forums leads to several threads of players asking what to do about the lag.

It was made a <em>little</em> easier with the introduction of "Death of the World" Exploration, but five shiny Pok&eacute;mon of the same primary type must be hatched just to unlock it, already a difficult task. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">To say nothing of the Exploration itself.</a>
</li><li> "Good Luck" requires completing a shiny Pok&eacute;mon hunt on the first egg hatched.
</li><li> "Lucky Day" requires two shiny Pok&eacute;mon hunts to be completed on the same day.
</li><li> "Elite Clicker" requires one to make <strong>250,000</strong> interactions in one day.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FlightRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FlightRising">Flight Rising</a></em> has the "Does Not Compute" achievement, awarded for obtaining a particular familiar that was only ever given to people who beta-tested the game. One could still get the achievement by buying or borrowing one from someone who has one, but their rarity makes them one of the most obscenely expensive items in the game and the few remaining active players who own one are loath to lend them out due to the risk of theft.
</li><li> The achievements of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame">Idle Game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookieClicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CookieClicker">Cookie Clicker</a></em> are generally very grindy, due to the nature of idle games, but some of them have problems beyond just taking time.
<ul><li> "Black cat's paw" requires you to click the ridiculous amount of <strong>7777</strong> golden cookies. These cookies are very rare and will fade away if you don't click them fast enough, so you will have to stare at your screen and click every cookie you see for a long, long time.
</li><li> "Uncanny Clicker" requires you to click "really fast". How much is really fast? Well, 15 clicks per second. That might not sound bad, but it certainly is bad. It's basically impossible to do this without autoclickers or using workarounds. The function responsible for unlocking this achievement is even called "autoclickerDetected".
</li><li> "Neverclick" and "Hardcore" are huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang Its</a>. One requires you to use no upgrades at all, while the other one requires you to not click the big cookie more than 15 times. If you break those requirements, these achievements are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost</a> unless you either purge your save file or you ascend and restart in challenge mode, which will disable all your heavenly upgrades until you leave the mode. So unless you know about these achievements before you even start the game, you will have a hard time getting these. (True Neverclick is even worse, but since it is a shadow achievement, you don't actually need it in order to get maximum milk)
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the achievements of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame">Idle Game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trimps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trimps">Trimps</a></em> are fairly straightforward and achievable by just getting lots of Helium (reach zone x0, buy x housing, portal x times). There are exceptions, most of which are the Feats, more specific and sometimes strange achievements.
<ul><li> "Underachiever" requires you to clear zone 30 while spending less than 60 Helium and without respecing during the run. This gives you almost nothing to work with. On top of that, you can't invest much in the Agility perk, which increases game speed, so the run becomes even slower than normal. It's doable with good heirlooms, but <em>extremely</em> tedious. To add insult to injury, it's only worth a measly 2.5% bonus damage.
</li><li> "Unessenceted" is the same idea taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. You have to get to Zone 180 with no Helium spent whatsoever. Since Helium is the main way to progress, this requires you to pile up every other mechanic to the best it can do.
</li><li> "Survivor." You have to clear a Destructive Void Map over level 60 without a group dying. Destructive Void Maps impose a debuff that reduces your group's current HP by 20% every attack. The effect compounds, getting you orders of magnitude below your normal health levels. In order not to die, you must have enough Block to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> all enemy attacks.
</li><li> "Hoarder" requires you to build a million Traps, which takes over a day of constant building. This was simplified a lot with the arrival of offline progress, which lets you build even with the game closed.
</li><li> Humane Run achievements are especially nasty. You have to reach a certain zone (a multiple of 50) without having more than one group of Trimps die in a zone. It requires constant management and equipment upgrading, and one mistake could ruin all progress. Even entering a map to farm requires abandoning your soldiers, which counts as a death. The highest-valued one, Righteous, requires you to beat zone <em><strong>600</strong></em> without losing more than one battle.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> has <strong>Pt</strong> (earn platinum times in all events), <strong>Streetwise</strong> (collect all 200 landmark collectibles), and <strong>Revenge Revisted</strong> (beat hard mode). For the first, the problem is obvious for those familiar with trying to get high scores and incredible time records. The Platinum medals range from easy to challenging to "I just broke the controller in frustration". Some are quite literally luck-based no matter how skilled you are. The second isn't hard per se, but even with a guide, it's easy to miss one and find yourself backtracking through the entire list to find it (reportedly a glitch can make one temporarily not appear, making it even worse). And finally Hard mode would not be so bad if not for the fact that the game has a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Missions</a>, but it does, and they are all a pain in the ass on Hard Mode.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em> games have mostly easy achievements, but each has at least one that is a nightmare to get:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em> has the "Blue Collar" achievement. Most of the other minigames are easy with a little practice, but the tow truck one will have gamers pulling their hair out as one tiny bit of bad luck near the end sends them all the way back to the start. The controls and time limit don't help matters much either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> has -
<ul><li> the "You're My Hero" achievement. You have to 100% all the challenges in the game, some of which can become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnWinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnWinnable">Unwinnable</a> if not completed before the end. Even if it the player avoids this they'll still have a hard time with a few other challenges if they don't complete them by the end of the game.
</li><li> The Johnnyguard in "The Trouble with Clones" DLC. You have to prevent Johnny Tag from taking any damage from the military. Oh, the first few phases might go okay, but just wait till you have to handle both the tanks and helicopters at the same time. And it doesn't help that between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">Painfully Slow Projectile</a> both you and your enemies are firing and how their attacks don't hurt Johnny... until they suddenly do... it can seem like you're going to make it only to suddenly notice the missing chunk of health. Time to return to checkpoint!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> has "On a Rail." The goal: "travel 1,000 meters by minecart from your starting point." It's not <em>that</em> hard, but the engineering and resources required are insane. One minecart costs 5 Iron Ingots. 16 meters worth of minecart tracks is 6 Iron Ingots. That's <em>378</em> Iron Ingots, right there. If you find abandoned mine shafts, however, the abandoned tracks can be collected for no cost. Of course, the carts won't travel forever, so you'll need boosters. That's 6 Gold Ingots and one Redstone for 6 rails. Then there's the items needed to activate the rails, which is more resources. And after all of that, you have to build the whole track, which involves lots of excavation, clearing, placing, and testing the whole thing to make sure it actually works. But on the bright side, as long as the track is still active, it'll work if the achievement happens to be cleared. Thankfully, in the Xbox 360 version, the distance requirement is halved. PC players can build in Creative mode.
<ul><li> What really hurts, though is that every minor game update tends to wipe your achievements. Hope you saved that world with the 1000 meter track.
</li><li> "Sniper Duel" requires you to kill a skeleton from 50 meters away with the bow and arrow. Arrows lose altitude as they travel and it's tricky to aim accordingly due to the skeleton never staying still.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod">Garry's Mod</a></em> on Steam has a lot of these, the hardest being "Yes, I am the real garry!" which requires you to play on the same server as the programmer, Garry Newman. This is made difficult because, unless you're friends with him, you won't know where he is and he also doesn't play it much.
<ul><li> The achievements "Half Marathon" and "Marathon" require you to spend an absurd amount of time on the same server and map- <em>four</em> and <em>eight</em> hours (respectively) <em><strong>straight</strong></em>. Assuming your computer can handle the stress of running the game that long, you have to hope that the game and/or server doesn't spontaneously crash on you (which it is very prone to doing) and that the game doesn't just arbitrarily refuse to count your playtime and deny you the achievement (which it is also prone to doing).
</li><li> "Addict" requires <em><strong>one year</strong></em> of combined game time. That's <em>8,760</em> hours.
</li><li> "Secret Phrase" requires you to type in a very specific phrase on the chat. Even if you do figure it out, Garry is prone to change the phrase when he updates the game. Luckily, there are plenty of guides that tell you what the phrase is.
</li><li> Those are nothing compared to the Workshop achievements. Hope you made something really good! The worst is "Mega Upload," which requires getting 1,000 thumbs (likes) on a single item.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a> 2</em> gives us every co-op achievement. Since the servers are down, it is impossible to get them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> gives us "Pa-Pa-Pa Poker" which requires a full table at the beginning of the poker game, lasting long enough for the minimum bet to reach its maximum, and win a hand. To get 6 people to start the match alone is a challenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infamous">Infamous</a></em> has the "RockHound" trophy which requires you to obtain all 350 blast shards. Doesn't sound too hard except A. The blast shards you receive for completing some side missions don't count and B. You will have most likely checked every nook and cranny before tearing your hair out due to sheer frustration before you find them all. Lastly you only get a BRONZE TROPHY upon finding all the blast shards! Talk about a kick in the groin! Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS2">the sequel</a> makes finding all the blast shards a breeze in comparison with the blast shard sense ability being available after completing 60 side missions!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Knight in Shining Armors" achievement on the console version. To get it, you have to obtain the ultra-rare Mining Armor, craft every helmet for the Hardmode armors, get every other piece of armor, beat Ocram up to 30 times, then make 3 full sets of Hallowed Armor, plus 3 more of each Hardmode armor, and get a few hundred bars of Adamantite (the rarest ore in the game.)
</li><li> "Baleful Harvest" and "Ice Scream" on the PC version. Both achievements require you to reach the 15th wave of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Pumpkin Moon and Frost Moon</a>. Getting to the 15th wave is hard enough, with its fair share of increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">dangerous enemies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">bosses</a> that are capable of incapacitating and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rushing</a> players easily without some preparation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> being in full effect for each wave, and lastly requiring you to do all of this before <em>dawn arrives.</em> To make matters even more worse, the whole night is nine real minutes long. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Have fun.</a> As of this writing, only 5.9% and 4.3% of players have gotten both achievements respectively.
</li><li> "Supreme Helper Minion" on the PC version. Better hope you have the patience of a saint, as this requires you to complete <em>200</em> angler fishing quests. And since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">only one quest can be done per in-game day</a>, this will involve <em>lots and lots</em> of waiting. To put in perspective, you could theoretically do about 60 quests in a real-time day if you stayed up and were playing constantly. That means <em>three</em> real days of non-stop gameplay to complete 200 quests. Thankfully this achievement counts up alongside the other achievements related to quest fishing and the process can be slightly sped up with the Enchanted Sundial to skip to 4:30 AM (when a new day starts). Only problem is the Sundial has a cooldown of its own that lasts a whole in-game week or 168 real minutes. As of this writing, only 0.7% of players have gotten this achievement, making it the rarest achievement.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause</a> 2</em> has two of them: "Trying Everything Once"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22y67v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22y67v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22y67v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Drive all the vehicles in the game</span> and "Perfectionist."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23imnw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note23imnw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23imnw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Reach 75% of completion in story mode or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">mercenary mode</a></span> What makes them so tedious is the fact that some vehicles spawn only in precise locations or during some missions, meaning the achievement is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">unobtainable</a> if you didn't look up every nook and cranny during missions. And the second one is because the game is <em>ginormous</em> and that completion includes everything the game throws at you: finding the collectibles, completing missions, clearing up locations... You're in for <em>at least</em> 100 hours of gameplay to get it.
<ul><li> Note that DLC vehicles can count towards getting the former. Which means you may or not have to go looking for that damned Vanderbilt Leisure Liner...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause3">The sequel</a> chimes in with "Caught 'em All", awarded for having every vehicle available on your Rebel Drop list, either by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">"Liberating"</a> military bases, or by bringing an example of the vehicle to a chop shop. There's one vehicle that makes this hard: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBoat">Squalo X7</a>, which spawns in exactly two places in the world, both of which are land-locked lakes. The boat is also very large and extremely heavy, meaning that airlifting it to the open ocean is an exercise in patience, frustration, and having all the grapple upgrades. The other alternative, towing it overland by vehicle or chain of retracting tethers, is tedious and difficult as well. At least the reward is worth it - being the fastest boat in the game and heavily armored enough to shrug off sea mines, it makes boat races much easier.
<ul><li> Another vehicle that's not difficult so much as punishingly tedious is the dump truck. They only spawn in mining sites, far from any garages, and as slow as you'd expect a mining truck to be. They're far too heavy to airlift or tow, and, while tough, will get trashed off-roading by the sheer number of trees they'll have to bash through. And as a cherry on top, there's only one road that'll get you to a garage; the others have checkpoint gates that are just an inch too short to let the truck through, and your GPS doesn't account for them at all.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Factorio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Factorio">Factorio</a></em> has the "There is no spoon" achievement, which requires the player to finish the game (build the rocket and launch it with a satellite) within <em>8 hours</em>. This is an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, as it all but requires the map to have perfect placement of both resource patches and enemy bases. And don't think you can cheese it on "Peaceful" mode - the achievement is disabled on any map that has the enemies set to any level below "normal".

<ul><li> The Wikia network of wikis have badges earned through various tasks. One requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay">contributing every day for 365 days</a>. Can't get online, find an issue, usually edit during the UTC date-change, or otherwise don't go on the wiki for a day? Sorry, pal. The worst part? The system encourages vandalism or violating image policies, because a well-run wiki or one on a game that doesn't update will guarantee them impossible to earn otherwise. They are being removed with the UCP redesign, though.
<ul><li> There's also the Pounce! and the Caffeinated "secret" badges, which aren't shown on the userpages and have no real indication of progress. Pounce! requires you to get 100 first edits on newly created pages within the hour of creation, and Caffeinated requires a whopping 100 edits a day. Unless if you're on a fanon wiki (Fantendo, Ideas), the badges are basically impossible.
