</div></div><p>There are some well-known works that gathered controversy throughout the years, and there are also famously controversial works in which the controversy, whether rightful or not, would overshadow most other aspects. Which isn't to say that works in the latter category have no other redeeming factor, just that most people would know little else aside from the controversial aspects.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Bad reviews alone do not make a controversial moment, and in fact some works can be well-regarded by critics and those who watched, read or played the work, and not all works listed here are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">laughably bad</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible">outright terrible</a>. Plot-related twists are generally not what makes up the category either, even if such cases are subjective. The major qualifier is that the works would be known beyond the fans of a particular genre that there's little knowledge of some other parts of a work to the general public.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDeviation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDeviation">Adaptation Deviation</a>.

</li><li> Pervasive balance issues, especially when they clearly overbuff popular characters, throw unnecessary buffs at characters who have expensive new skins coming out, or habitually release new characters in a blatantly overpowered state.

</li><li> A work with a hardcore cult or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geek">Geek</a> following becomes mainstream, and as such tries to cater to that more mainstream audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldGuardVersusNewBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldGuardVersusNewBlood">instead of the original fandom</a>.
</li><li> The work tries to comment on social issues or current events, but does so in a clunky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narmish</a>, adulation-grabbing, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">tone-deaf way</a>.

</li><li> A work that is satirical in nature is done in an extremely clumsy and ill-conceived manner rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation">Cultural Translation</a> that comes off as more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a>.
</li><li> A work that may have been well received at the time it was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">hasn't aged well, and instead becomes dated and/or offensive</a>.
</li><li> A work becomes widely derided for having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">an incredibly off-putting premise</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingAversion">The work's ending is widely despised</a>, causing people to ignore the plot <em>leading</em> to said ending.

</li><li> Habitual blame games and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a> whenever an aspect of a work receives a negative reception, especially when a creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader">attacks fans for not accepting it</a> (especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyFandomCantHaveNiceThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyFandomCantHaveNiceThings">Why Fandom Can't Have Nice Things</a> is invoked for situations where the backlash is completely understandable) or blame some sort of conspiracy to undermine them when all the evidence points to the fault being theirs and theirs alone.
</li><li> Someone involved with the work is the perpetrator of a violent crime (such as rape or murder).
</li><li> Someone involved with the work holds a view that is taboo in mainstream society (e.g. support for racial supremacy, sympathizing with perpetrators over victims in domestic/sexual violence cases, or anti-LGBTQ beliefs), or unintentionally makes a comment that implies holding such views.

</li><li> The creator makes promise after promise that they fail to keep or botch the delivery of, especially if they fail to take responsibility for dropping the ball and/or blame someone else (<em>especially</em> if they blame fans for taking issue).
</li><li> A work has a creator who has some highly questionable views that people were originally able to separate from the work, but eventually spur people to examine the work more closely, which reveals a lot of previously undetected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> or outright dogwhistles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">Mass recasts</a>, especially abrupt ones.
</li><li> Production <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">missing previously-stated deadlines for release</a>, especially if said release has been heavily hyped or anticipated, or a delay is announced shortly before release.

Nowadays, however, he is more known for his arrest in 2015 where he ultimately pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and traveling to pay for sex with minors.
</li><li> In 2017, Pepsi released an ad starring Kendall Jenner where during a photo shoot, she decides to hand a Pepsi to a cop during the middle of a protest. The ad was heavily panned for being tone deaf and promoting the message that Pepsi would ease tensions between protesting factions. Pepsi would eventually pull it due to the backlash.
</li><li> One ad from Coca-Cola simply featured the famous "America the Beautiful" being sung by several people of various ethnicities and walks of life, some of whom sang it in different languages. Many people were outraged at the song being sung in anything but English, as well as those on the hard right who condemned it as "liberal propaganda" for showcasing the cultural and ethnic diversity of America<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26ux8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note26ux8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26ux8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(including some that were convinced for some reason that Coke showing a Mexican-American in the commercial was them promoting illegal immigration)</span> and issued a boycott online. Naturally, this has only allowed the ad to become more memorable; since the initial 2014 airing, Coke has reaired the commercial during major American events and holidays as a sign of unity.

Absolute hatred. Both from the fans and the English publishers. Why? Because it's a manga that takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">Cure Your Gays</a> route <em>far</em> too seriously, bringing along with it a whole mountain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> regarding lesbianism and gender roles. The English publishers treat it as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> and don't ever bring it up anymore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> will forever be remembered for its ending where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the main character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">dates and then marries his adopted daughter</a></span> than any of its own merits before that.

The fallout from this led Toei to restructure their Latin American division and make it so that, in <em>The Final Chapters</em>, where possible, all characters were voiced by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalDarrin">original voice actors.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5fnew');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5fnew" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5fnew');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The few exceptions were either due to retirement or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> was hit with this early on, thanks to the decision of making the first two sagas adaptations of the two canon <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> movies, which was seen as very repetitive and invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">It Was His Sled</a>, especially since they had been released very recently at the time of <em>Super</em>'s debut, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">notoriously awful</a> animation early on, <em>especially</em> with Episode 5, ended up overshadowing any of the content. The series later improved (although some controversial plot elements of certain sagas ended up overshadowing said sagas, such as the Future Trunks Saga ending with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire future timeline getting wiped out of existence by Zeno</span>) but the whole "rehashing the movies" and quality early on remains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a> moment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> gets a lot of scrutiny from American videophiles because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalDestruction">Digital Destruction</a> that has plagued all home video releases since the mid-2000s, including, among other things, cropping the whole series to 16:9. Even the first 4:3 release in a long while, made from film elements FUNimation happened to still have, got flack for excessive DVNR. It's gotten to the point where videophiles have gone on record as wanting to seek out the seven Dragon Balls to wish that FUNimation would simply import and upscale the far superior-looking Dragon Box DVD releases issued by Toei.
</li></ul></li><li> The ecchi manga and OVA <em>Eiken</em> was near-universally despised by viewers and critics, and has made virtually no impact otherwise... well, except for the fact that the girl with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">largest breasts</a> in an already exaggerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBuxom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBuxom">World of Buxom</a> is only <em>11 years old</em>.

The backlash to this, including the harassment of Tomason's staff by disgruntled fans (including an incident where the animation director's name was used to fraudulently sign the studio on for multiple paid online services, resulting in getting swamped with emails and phone calls asking for info) and the <em>massive</em> dislike bombing every episode got on Niconico in protest, is likely not to be forgotten as well.

They had only seen the first book, which isn't too bad in terms of content. Then the controversy erupted. Initially, Seven Seas defended the title, but a combination of major book chains refusing to stock it and their reading the later volumes (which come very close to violating the PROTECT Act) caused them to change their mind and drop it.

Since some fundamentalist Muslims, such as the ones in question, believe that only Muslims are entitled to read the Quran, the sight of a supernatural non-Muslim glancing at a few pages of it was bound to infuriate them. Repercussions of this controversy spread elsewhere. As a result of this outrage, Shueisha cut off ties with A.P.P.P., circulation of the OVAs was temporarily halted to remove the Quran text, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirohikoAraki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HirohikoAraki">Hirohiko Araki</a> himself was forced to redraw the original manga to replace mosques and other Muslim buildings that get harmed or destroyed with more secular constructions. The whole incident and the resulting censorship was heavily scorned by critics as "embarrassing," and Shueisha's distancing from A.P.P.P. is heavily believed to be one of the leading contributors to the failure of A.P.P.P.'s 2007 film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Phantom Blood</a></em>.

</li><li> Usually, the only times <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Stitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Stitch">Stitch!</a></em> comes up among Western <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em> fans is to complain about it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthSequel">Stealth Sequel</a> and how it ruins the original series' theme about "&#699;ohana" and family.

</li><li> The life and career of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> co-founder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaoTakahata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaoTakahata">Isao Takahata</a> was overshadowed in August 2018 by revelations that he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">Prima Donna Director</a>, being so tough to work under that his exacting standards may have led to the untimely passing of up-and-coming Ghibli talent Yoshifumi Kond&#333;, a theory that fellow Ghibli co-founder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and even Takahata himself were willing to believe. Worse, he died without ever having to account for the damage he might have done, leaving his legacy (if not the enjoyability of his works) up in the air. The controversy never made Takahata's movies' reputations radioactive, but it's still an elephant in the room when it comes to discussing Takahata and his works.
</li><li> In early February 2018, internet users found the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> account of Kazuyoshi Yaginuma, long-renowned for his work on a number of high-profile anime, most notably his direction of the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RecoveryOfAnMMOJunkie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RecoveryOfAnMMOJunkie">Recovery of an MMO Junkie</a></em>, only to find that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-02-09/recovery-of-an-mmo-junkie-director-causes-controversy-with-anti-semitic-tweets/.127409">he's a virulent Neo-Nazi<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> who had been posting and endorsing anti-Semitic and pro-Hitler content since joining Twitter in 2011. The discovery led to Signal.MD terminating their association with Yaginuma, who proceeded to blame his firing on a nonexistent Jewish conspiracy instead of considering that it had anything to do with him being a Neo-Nazi. Needless to say, discussions surrounding him revolve less on the merits of his artistic output and more on his beliefs and the ethics of supporting the works he contributed to despite them, with <em>MMO Junkie</em> being hit the hardest.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> franchise is better known for the sheer amount of legal trouble that it was involved with in the United States. To explain, Big West Advertising, the primary sponsor of the franchise, partnered with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TatsunokoProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TatsunokoProduction">Tatsunoko Production</a> to help secure financial funding for the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>, which gave the latter the rights to the international distribution of the show. Tatsunoko would then license <em>Macross</em>, along with two of it's own productions, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMOSPEADA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMOSPEADA">Genesis Climber MOSPEADA</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross</a></em>, to Harmony Gold USA, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">reworked</a> all three of them into a single narrative for syndication purposes: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em>. Through this, Harmony Gold would claim all the rights to the Macross franchise in the United States. This has lead to <em>Macross</em> producer Studio Nue and the aforementioned Big West to pursue legal action, and has resulted in most of the installments in the franchise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never leaving Japan</a>.
</li><li> Yuki Suegutsu is chiefly known for two things: her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">Career Resurrection</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chihayafuru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chihayafuru">Chihayafuru</a></em> and her earlier career low point with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdenNoHana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EdenNoHana">Eden no Hana</a></em> in which she plagiarized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakehikoInoue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakehikoInoue">Takehiko Inoue</a>'s art, putting all manga serialized in the <em>Bessatsu Friend</em> magazine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">on an international blacklist</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, being an American toy line created by importing and re-purposing Japanese toys, has had several Japanese media, many of which fall into this:
<ul><li> <em>Transformers Kiss Players</em> is undoubtedly best known for its blatantly suggestive imagery involving teenage girls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">that look prepubescent</a>. Western fans were disgusted by this, while Japanese fans were embarrassed and feared it would irrevocably color perceptions of Japanese <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> media in foreign countries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> is mainly remembered for debuting in the U.S. six months before it debuted in Japan, the animation and translation errors that resulted from it, and the first half focusing almost entirely on finding Mini-Cons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em>, the sequel to <em>Armada</em>, is best known for its use of rather primitive CGI to depict the Transformers (especially compared to the earlier Canadian series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em>), the massive unpopularity of viewpoint character Kicker, the fact that most of the subplots were unresolved or unceremoniously dropped, the main story running out before the show was over, and an English dub that was even more rushed than its predecessor, resulting in the show being barely coherent.
</li></ul></li><li> Formerly one of the most popular and biggest dubbing companies in America, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> is now primarily remembered for their <em>heavily</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerised">Bowdlerised</a> English dubs that frequently bordered on straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a>. Add that to the dubs themselves making questionable writing changes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Americanization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Americanization">removing any traces of Japanese culture</a> from their source materials.

<ul><li> The Cadillac Cimarron, GM's first attempt at a luxury compact, front-wheel drive sedan was, in and of itself, not that bad of a vehicle when introduced in 1982, no worse than the identical Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird (as well as the Buick Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Firenza). In fact, the Cadillac, on paper and in some actual respects, was a better car than it J-car siblings given equipment that was either optional on the other J-cars or in some cases not even available (for instance, tuned suspension and beefier stabilizer bars), and had standard air conditioning, leather interior and power outside remote mirrors, all options on the other J-cars. <br><br>However, the vehicle also had a four-cylinder engine that, while certainly competent, was unbefitting of a Cadillac, with no optional engine (or larger, more powerful engine ... let alone a marque-exclusive one) even offered ... also, a standard four-speed <em>manual</em> transmission (purportedly because other entry-level luxury vehicles from Europe also had manual-shift transmissions standard) meant customers had to order the automatic transmission (the only type of transmission offered in Cadillacs since at least 1953). <br><br>Additionally, many automobile writers and testers preferred the European luxury makes' entry-level luxury cars (such as the BMW 325i and Mercedes-Benz 190D), which they said handled and performed better than what was essentially a Chevrolet Cavalier with a Cadillac price ... and despite its $12,000 standard price (for 1982), buyers still had to order such conveniences as power windows, door locks and seats (which had been standard on virtually every Cadillac model for years). <br><br>Despite improvements in subsequent model years to address early Cimarron shortcomings, including a V-6 engine and at least a 5-speed manual transmission standard (automatic transmission was always optionally available), many buyers stayed away from not only the Cimarron but the other true luxury Cadillac vehicles ... they didn't want to be associated with a car make that sold what was essentially an overpriced Pontiac Sunbird. Only after Cadillac finally pulled the plug on the Cimarron at the end of the 1988 model year was its brand name salvaged.
</li><li> The first-generation Chevrolet Corvair was one of GM's most popular models during the 1960s, but it is better known today for its handling issues, a problem that was further compounded when it was revealed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader in his book <em>Unsafe at Any Speed</em> that GM executives had declined to include suspension upgrades that would have made the car safer after calculating that paying off lawsuits was cheaper than re-engineering the car.
</li><li> The General Motors EV1 was one of the first mass-produced electric cars and had a moderate amount of success when it first came out. Today, it is best known for the fact that General Motors would end up forcefully repossessing several units of the car and destroying them (with a few intact units being disabled and donated to museums), believing that the car was unprofitable. The EV1's discontinuation remains controversial to this day, with many accusing General Motors of deliberate self-sabotage, and accusing the oil industry of trying to keep electric cars off the road.
</li><li> The Ford Pinto was actually a good car with better reliability than its American competitors but is remembered for the gas tank flaw from its first couple of years model that made it explode in rear-end collisions. Even the trope referring to exploding cars is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">Every Car Is a Pinto</a>.
</li><li> Google's self-driving car/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatedAutomobiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatedAutomobiles">Automated Automobiles</a> project is seen like this, with some people seeing it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed Richards Is Useless</a> technology (and by extension, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobStealingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JobStealingRobot">Job-Stealing Robot</a>).
</li><li> Uber counts, not only due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatedAutomobiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatedAutomobiles">Automated Automobiles</a>, but also being a way to steal taxi driver's jobs, as the many Uber protests show. The controversies surrounding its former CEO Travis Kalanick haven't helped matters.
</li><li> The concept of an electric car, in general, has been overshadowed by controversy since the attempts by many major companies to produce them in the '90s. The cars flopped, but conspiracy theories grew that the automotive industry deliberately mismarketed and sabotaged their own efforts in order to continue making money via the oil industry. While it's generally agreed now that the technology to create a decent electric car wasn't quite there at the time, the oil industry <em>did</em> directly campaign against electric cars in their marketing and literature. Much of this perception has stuck around today and contributes to the criticism against the Tesla.
</li><li> The Pontiac G6 suffered an extremely ill-considered marketing ploy in which the entire audience for an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOprahWinfreyShow">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a></em> was given a car for free, with the quickly memetic "You get a car, you get a car, <em>everybody</em> gets a car!" Just one problem: ownership of the car also meant a sizable spike in the recipients' income, meaning they wound up with a $6,000 tax hike, and with much of the audience for the episode specifically chosen because they badly needed a car, they were naturally in no position to pay it, meaning many of the cars ended up being sold just to cover their own cost. The disaster almost certainly played at least some part in the death of Pontiac, something its Aztek was already in the process of doing. Oprah learned her lesson, and the numerous similar promotions she's done since have also included a check to cover the taxes.

<ul><li> These days, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> creator Scott Adams is considerably better-known for his outspoken support of US President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> than for his cartooning. And while the average comic strip reader might ordinarily be willing to overlook a cartoonist's politics, Adams drew quite a bit of attention to it when he published a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_Bigly">rather controversial pro-Trump book<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> whose cover art featured an image of Dogbert with Trump's hair. Because of this, <em>Dilbert</em> unsurprisingly lost a lot of fans who dislike Trump.
</li><li> In its heyday, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LilAbner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LilAbner">Li'l Abner</a></em> was one of the most famous and influential comics strips in America. Moreover, strip creator Al Capp was a well-known and recognizable public figure in his own right. But in the 1960s, Capp drifted into a right-wing crank who sneered at folk singers and political activists, and this started bleeding into the comic itself. Before long, his politics became a cloud that hung over his work. Then he was arrested on sex-related charges in 1971 and papers began to drop his strip in droves. Now, it's hard to talk about the strip without discussing its creator's prickly personality, ideological hang-ups, and the allegations that he committed sexual misconduct.
</li><li> Brazilian political cartoonist Carlos Latuff is one of the most notorious figures in his chosen field, and his work is impossible to discuss without mentioning the fact that it contains frequent explicit depictions of both physical and sexual violence, portrays the United Kingdom, United States, and Israel as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">nothing more than nations full of bloodthirsty barbarians</a>, and that Latuff has drawn comics supporting the late Iraqi dictator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, Virginia Tech University Massacre perpetrator Seung-Hui Cho, and other extremist organizations and individuals, portraying them as valiant martyrs against Western imperialism. These facts have caused even many people who agree with his positions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage">to be reluctant to associate with him</a>.

One spin-off writer, Chatoyance, is especially controversial for essentially taking the above and taking them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">to the next level</a> and then some. Three particular stories stand out: <em>Ten Minutes: Aftermath</em>, a personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixFic">Fix Fic</a> that was interpreted (due to how Chatoyance posted a link <em>right on the original author's comments page</em>) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">middle finger</a> to the fans of the original <em>Ten Minutes</em> story; <em>The Reasonably Adamant Down with Celestia Newfoal Society</em>, which was little more than a caustic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatCritics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatCritics">insult</a> leveled at anyone that didn't like her work; and finally, the short story <em>New Universe Three: The Friendship Virus</em>, TCB fic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> that had overtly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen">misandric</a> messages. Chatoyance is also infamous for her radicalist transgender and feminist viewpoints.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakariKingMykan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakariKingMykan">Dakari-King Mykan</a> was already considered a terrible fanfiction writer to begin with, but his <em>several</em> run-ins with moderators, different fandoms, critics, and the like have made him a laughing stock.

His works involving <em>MLP</em> in the first place are also more remembered for the insane lengths Mykan is willing to go to torture Princess Cadance for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> (having her kill her roboticized brother, making her suffer nightmares, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing off Twilight Sparkle (which is another issue altogether), making her miscarry and become infertile</span>, etc.). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FriendshipIsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FriendshipIsFailure">Friendship is Failure</a> #10</em> has become especially infamous for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the beheading of Flurry Heart</span> for this exact purpose.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DumbledoresArmyAndTheYearOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DumbledoresArmyAndTheYearOfDarkness">Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness</a></em> is a fairly normal <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfiction, and was once widely acclaimed. However, it is also controversial for the many infamous antics of its author Thanfiction, particularly once he was exposed as being the same person as "Victoria Bitter", a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">con artist</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> fandom who swindled thousands of dollars out of dozens of people by claiming he would use it to organize a convention where fans could meet actors from the films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Stockholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Stockholm">Stockholm</a></em> is mostly known for three things: The fact that it was written by the notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilyOrchard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilyOrchard">Lily Orchard</a>, its depiction of Rainbow Dash as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ephebophile">Ephebophile</a>, and Orchard's subsequent attempts to remove the story and deny that it was pro-pedophilia. This despite including a graphic sex scene between a 14 year old and a 44 year old.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> fan film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PreludeToAxanar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PreludeToAxanar">Prelude to Axanar</a></em> and its sequel <em>Star Trek: Axanar</em> are infamous due to the actions of its creator Alec Peters, which included stealing from donor money, using the name and image of actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyTodd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyTodd">Tony Todd</a> to promote the film months after the actor had officially quit the project, and essentially using the <em>Star Trek</em> brand name to buy his way into being legitimate. The latter resulted in a lawsuit from CBS/Paramount that led to the companies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanworkBan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanworkBan">imposing severe restrictions on the content and production values of future fan productions</a> (which itself is a different can of worms), further tarnishing his reputation.

<ul><li> The first was in December 2017 after his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IWillSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IWillSurvive">I Will Survive</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> comic, written back in March of that year, caught the eye of the public. The comic featured Judy Hopps finding out that she's pregnant with Nick's child but decides she doesn't want the baby. Nick, on the other hand, objects and tries to convince Judy to keep the baby, which leads to a violent argument between the two and eventually their breakup. It quickly became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">laughingstock</a> among people for how blatantly out-of-character it portrays the two and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">over-the-top with the melodrama</a>.

However, because he chose an unwanted pregnancy as the reason for their breakup and that Judy wanted to terminate it, the comic drew hordes of pro-life and pro-choice commentators who cared little for the characters and focused obsessively on the potential abortion. As such he is prominently remembered as the guy who wrote the "Zootopia abortion comic" even though he has done a lot of other things besides it.

The Hollow is all but outright stated to be Emma, her character can best be described as a loser who obsessively watches <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> (a show the author hates), she's called "evil" and "ugly" by the protagonists, and the fic itself seems to allude to events preceding the breakup. Given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">implications of it all</a>, fan outrage was probably inevitable.

Even before the film was released to video and DVD in 2000, movie companies were coming under heavy criticism for violence in films during the fallout of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> shootings that had happened over a year ago, and WB felt pressured and afraid that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediaWatchdog">Media Watchdogs</a> would object that the movie would be a repeat of Columbine. As a result, the original release date (Halloween 2000) was postponed, and the film heavily edited and toned down for release on December 12. But even then, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerised</a> version (especially with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Joker's death scene changed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighVoltageDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighVoltageDeath">death by electrocution</a></span>) didn't help matters, but only caused unrest among many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> fans that lasted for over a year. That unrest thankfully quelled down when the film developers still retained the original version in shelves and eventually released it on DVD as "the original, uncut version" under the PG-13 rating on April 23, 2002 (just three days after the third anniversary of the Columbine tragedy) following an online petition to have it released. The same uncut version would be digitally remastered and released on Blu-Ray nine years later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheKillingJoke">Batman: The Killing Joke</a></em> ran right into this. The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">Killing Joke</a></em> comic had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">the Joker paralyzing Barbara Gordon</a> as its inciting incident, with little statement of who she actually <em>was</em> in the story itself. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> attempted to correct this by expanding Barbara's role in the story, but it was done in a way that comes off with more problems: namely the sexual tension between Batgirl and Batman.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12owat');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12owat" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12owat');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As well as the implication that Barbara became Batgirl largely because she had a crush on Batman.</span> This culminates in the two having sex which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicked</a> out a good portion of the audience, especially those who have seen Batman as more of a paternal mentor to Batgirl in other media.

</li><li> The 2019 Spanish animated feature <em>Elcano &amp; Magellan: The First Voyage Around the World</em>, based on the voyage of the Portuguese explorers of the same name (culminating in the Battle of Mactan), prompted major backlash in The Philippines, largely due to the poster showing Lapulapu (a native chief who participated in the battle and is widely revered as an anticolonialist hero in the Phillpines) in a decidedly villainous light. The backlash was to the point that many even petitioned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">ban the movie</a> in the country. The studio in charge seems to have gotten the hint, as they released a redesigned version of the poster where Lapulapu is replaced with an original Portuguese character named Yago. As it turns out, the original poster was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">rather inaccurate</a>, as Yago is the main antagonist of the movie and Lapulapu is little more than a glorified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">background character</a>. In a review of the movie, a Rappler columnist <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rappler.com/views/imho/244538-anger-toward-elcano-magellan-film-unjustified">bluntly pointed out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in criticism of such historical dramas, where he noted how the producers of the 2013 religious historical drama <em>Pedro Calungsod: Batang Martir</em> had no qualms about portraying the Chamorro people as barbaric savages who slayed Calungsod for his missionary work&mdash;the film was universally praised in the Philippines, and was unsurprisingly panned by the Chamorros in Guam.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OlafsFrozenAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OlafsFrozenAdventure">Olaf's Frozen Adventure</a></em> became known soon after its release less because of anything related to the film itself and more because of the circumstances behind said release: It was originally meant for a television special before being put as the opener for the Pixar film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco">Coco</a></em>, and the fact that its length was meant for television and not as an opener for a Pixar film upset many of the moviegoers who went just to see <em>Coco</em>. It went to the point that most Mexican movie theaters outright removed the short from their showings of <em>Coco</em> (as <em>Coco</em> prominently features Mexican culture as its backdrop) before Disney officially pulled it from all future screenings of <em>Coco</em> beginning on December 8, 2017. While Disney has not given an official reason why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4">Toy Story 4</a></em> is set to be the first Pixar film since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em> to not have a short subject attached to its theatrical release, the scuttlebug is that <em>Olaf's Frozen Adventure</em> had a lot to do with it. That's to say nothing about the film itself coming out in the wake of John Lasseter taking a leave of absence from the company (which later became permanent) due to sexual harassment allegations, which has made headlines as much as the movie itself. It hasn't harmed the critical or box office performance of the film, but it has made it much harder to talk about without mentioning the allegations in light of similar ones in the industry.

</li><li> Skydance Animation serves as one of the newly added divisions of film studio Skydance Media. Formed in 2017 through a multi-year partnership with Ilion Animation Studios, the new division gained recognition as a potential contender for producing future high quality animated films. However, they came under immediate fire in January 2019, when it was announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> founder and former Disney executive John Lasseter was made head of the division. As Lasseter was struck with multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and sexist behavior less than two years prior, Skydance was met with heavy criticism for being willing to work with him, let alone having him be head of one of their divisions. As a result, both the division and Skydance Media as a whole lost a lot of support from most of the public. This also cost them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaThompson">Emma Thompson</a>, who'd been set to star in one of the films placed under Lasseter's supervision and then quit over his hiring even before she'd been announced to be in the film, leading to even more attention being placed on the issue.

However, most people know him for a 2007 incident where he referred to the Rutgers University women's basketball team (which included nine black players) as "nappy-headed hos". His apology and CBS Radio's decision to suspend him (and subsequently cancel his show, <em>Imus in the Morning</em>, which moved to Citadel Media a few months later) ignited further controversy, with some saying he earned forgiveness with his apology, and others saying a strong stand needed to be taken.

<ul><li> Ty Cobb. While he is one of the greatest baseball players of all time, his reputation suffers from allegations of racism and violence, largely stemming from a couple of biographies that were released following his death that were later largely discredited.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15vmq2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15vmq2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15vmq2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Cobb's reputation as an extremely violent man was fanned by his first biographer, sportswriter Al Stump, whose stories about Cobb have been discredited as sensationalized, and in some part proven to be entirely fictional. While it is held that Cobb did have racist views early on his life, his views on race evolved and mellowed after his retirement from baseball, with Cobb being a proponent of the sport becoming integrated.</span>
</li><li> The Kansas City Royals won their first World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals in 1985, but that series is better remembered for one of the worst officiating calls in baseball history. In the bottom of the ninth of Game 6, umpire Don Denkinger ruled Jorge Orta safe at first when the throw clearly beat him there<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note163ano');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note163ano" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note163ano');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the fourth inning of the same game, Royals player Frank White had been called out at second in a questionable call (replays showed he actually beat the tag); since he likely would have scored on Sheridan's single two pitches later had the call been made correctly, it could be argued that the two bad calls effectively cancelled each other out</span>. The Cardinals imploded, losing that game and getting routed in Game 7. Not helping matters is Denkinger ejecting Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog and pitcher Joaqu&iacute;n And&uacute;jar in the clincher which led to fans sending him death threats.

All were stripped afterward when it turned out he had used a complicated and watertight system to use doping. It seems unlikely he will ever be trusted again.
</li><li> American soccer player Hope Solo has had her legacy as one of the best goalkeepers in the women's sport permanently stained by her arrest on charges of assaulting her half-sister and nephew. It doesn't help that many were quick to accuse her case of exemplifying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> in American sports, pointing to multiple cases of male athletes suffering far more immediate and serious consequences from their leagues for violent behavior.

Since then, she only gets in the news media for the kind of behavior you wouldn't want to become famous for; it doesn't help that, whether innocent or not, she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">some serious character flaws</a> that make it difficult for her to endear herself to the public.

Most people today know him solely for the murder trial or for subsequently getting arrested for stealing what he alleges was property stolen from him.
</li><li> Tim Tebow:
<ul><li> Among the general public, Tebow is better known for bringing his conservative Christian beliefs onto the field than he is for his football and baseball careers. Some people considered his overt displays of his piety to be unproblematic, while others (including other Christians) said he was choosing an inappropriate time and place to demonstrate his beliefs, and that he was cheapening his faith by "showboating". Not helping matters is that his former habit of wearing references to biblical verses on his eye black is widely perceived to have led to the NCAA making a rule banning messages in eye black, leading to the new prohibition being nicknamed "the Tebow rule".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note188w0w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note188w0w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note188w0w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The NCAA denies that Tebow had anything to do with the imposition of the rule.</span> There are many who, in retrospect, view the controversy as an uncanny foreshadowing of a similar controversy that ignited over Colin Kaepernick's kneeling.
</li><li> Tebow's managed to be this in a second sport. After his pro football career ended, Tebow decided he'd like to try his hand at professional baseball (despite the fact that by this point the 28-year-old Tebow was several years older than most minor leaguers and hadn't played in a competitive baseball game since his junior year of high school). The New York Mets signed him to a minor league contract in 2016. His substandard performance (his career batting average over three years is a miserable .223) and rapid movement up the Mets' minor league ladder despite no signs of improvement has led to accusations both from fans and players that Tebow is a sideshow who is just there to sell tickets and move merchandise while taking up a roster spot that could have been used on a <em>legitimate</em> prospect.
</li></ul></li><li> Tennis player John McEnroe was one of the most glorious champions in his sport, even managing to give Bj&ouml;rn Borg a difficult time during Wimbledon 1980. Yet he mostly lives on in people's memories for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> and profrane yelling at the referee during many matches. It has gotten to the point that there's more demand to see that kind of archive footage again than him winning his matches.
</li><li> Nick Kyrgios used to be praised as a bright young talent who beat Rafael Nadal at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships as a teenager. Then at the 2015 Rogers Cup during a match against Stan Wawrinka, he made a snide comment under his breath about how his countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis had banged Wawrinka's new girlfriend. His mic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingStillOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingStillOn">picked it up</a>, the public love for him turned to derision overnight, and ever since then 90% of all headlines about him have been about his continued controversial and attention-seeking behavior rather than about his actual tennis results.
</li><li> French soccer champion Zinedine Zidane is world famous for one incident during his final game where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead">headbutted another player</a>. Especially to people who don't know much about soccer, like American citizens, this is all they know about him. What's especially embarrassing was that Zidane's disqualification as a result of the headbutt cost France its victory in the 2006 World Cup game with Italy. What usually isn't mentioned is that the Italian whom Zidane attacked, Marco Materazzi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">insulted both his heritage and his sister</a>.
</li><li> Naomi Osaka's victory in the 2018 U.S. Open has been overshadowed by Serena Williams accusing umpire Carlos Ramos of sexism and racism after he penalized her during the second set, and the subsequent debate about whether or not Williams was right.
</li><li> Former NBA player Latrell Sprewell is less well-known for his accomplishments than he is for his various troubles. The first serious controversy was a 1997 incident where he choked and elbowed Golden State Warriors head coach P. J. Carlesimo, resulting in him being suspended for 68 games. During this suspension, he pled no contest to charges of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivesLikeCrazy">reckless driving</a> after injuring two people in a 90 mph car accident. Then in 2005, he unexpectedly ended his career when he refused a $21 million contract offer from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which he implied wouldn't be enough to feed his children. And then you have his very turbulent personal life and legal and financial problems since the end of his career, such as being accused of trying to strangle a woman mid-coitus and getting his yacht repossessed after failing to continue paying for it.
</li><li> Nowadays, Dennis Rodman is known less for his basketball career, and more for his bizarre and widely-criticized friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
</li><li> Penn State's Joe Paterno is the winningest coach in major college football history, but will forever be remembered in connection with longtime assistant coach and serial child molester Jerry Sandusky.
</li><li> Despite Michael Schumacher being the driver with most victories and titles in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">F1</a>, he still more remembered for his controversial actions in some races, especially in the finale of 1997 season when he tried to wreck Jacques Villeneuve for winning the championship. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">He failed, ended in the gravel trap and after the race, he was excluded from the championship</a>.
</li><li> During his very short F1 career, Nelson Piquet Jr. became infamous for the "crashgate scandal" in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. On the fourteenth lap of the race, he deliberately crashed into the wall, forcing the safety car and helping his teammate, Fernando Alonso, finish first thanks to an early pit stop. Unlike many cases listed here, he has since made a name for himself in other racing categories, including NASCAR (which had an infamous reputation for being very hard for drivers coming from open-wheel racing background to adapt) and Formula E (winning the inaugural championship).
</li><li> Ryan Lochte was known for being one of the best swimmers in the world, winning multiple Olympic medals. Then during the 2016 Rio Olympics, he, along with some other swimmers, drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom and caused a confrontation with a security guard. After the fact, Lochte made up a story about being robbed at gunpoint to cover up the incident and flew back to America, leaving the other swimmers involved to deal with the fallout in Rio. Once the attempted cover-up came to light, nearly any mention of Lochte in the media referenced the incident.
</li><li> Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius is nowadays more known for shooting his girlfriend dead, for which he was convicted in 2015, than for his track career.
</li><li> Violette Morris was a very talented French athlete who proved impressive in a wide variety of sports. But it's pretty safe to say most people aware of her remember her as a spy for and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">collaborator</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. Reviled for her treachery and brutality, she was assassinated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the French Resistance</a> in 1944.
</li><li> Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sparked controversy due to his kneeling during the national anthem during the 2016 NFL season to protest racial oppression and police brutality. Although he did not violate any rules (NFL players were encouraged to stand during the anthem but were not <em>required</em> to do so), a backlash against Kaepernick led to him getting blackballed from the NFL. This ultimately backfired when other NFL players began kneeling during the anthem, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s protests and demands that the players who do so be fired only added further fuel to the fire. While Kaepernick's actions and the controversy that followed them were re-analyzed in 2020 after several high-profile deaths of African Americans, most notably George Floyd in May 2020, at the hands of police officers sparked massive protests across America, it still meant that nowadays, Kaepernick is better known as an activist than a football player.
</li><li> Marion Jones was a superstar track and field runner in the '90s with lots of charm and charisma. Famous for winning five medals in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. However, rumors began to spread that she was using steroids after the medical company Balco was exposed for giving many famous athletes illegal drugs that were undetectable by drug test back then. Jones was one of the athletes named. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty">She was successfully able to deny it</a>, until she was caught up in an insurance fraud racket. She made a deal to confess to using steroids in order to reduce jail time. Her medals were stripped and she is now known as one of the greatest Olympic tragedies.
</li><li> The Washington Redskins were best known for the fact that they took their name from a racial slur used against Native Americans, resulting in many campaigns to attempt to persuade them to change it. None of these succeeded until July 2020, when various major outlets (including Nike and Amazon) refused to sell any more Washington football merchandise unless the name was changed.
</li><li> The United States Football League is mostly remembered for the fact that one of the team owners, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, pushed the league to schedule its 1986 season in direct competition with the NFL, in the belief that it would force a merger between the two leagues. This effort failed, bankrupting the USFL and driving it into obscurity.
</li><li> FIFA spent decades facing rumors and allegations of corruption. These came to a head in 2015 after nine of its top officials and five associated businesspeople were indicted by the United States Justice Department for wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering. Nowadays, FIFA is most widely known for its corruption among the general public.
</li><li> English former football player and manager Paul "Gazza" Gascoigne is nowadays best known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcoholism</a>, his serious mental issues, and his repeated run-ins with the law.
</li><li> Larry Nassar, while never well known by the public, was a reputable physician in American gymnastics circles, being the USA Gymnastics national team doctor for some time and also the house doctor for the Karolyi Ranch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">B&eacute;la and M&aacute;rta K&aacute;rolyi</a> fame.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19ezq5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19ezq5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19ezq5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which was also the official USA Gymnastics and women's national gymnastics team training grounds.</span> This changed when two former gymnasts publicly accused Nassar of sexual abuse in 2016. This led to other women accusing him of sexual abuse as well, with more than 300 victims eventually coming forward. These allegations would ultimately expose a pattern of sexual abuse that had been prevalent since at least <em>1992</em>. As a result, it's almost impossible that he will ever recover his former reputation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence">as he was sentenced to 60 years for child porn in federal prison in 2017. He was also sentenced in 2018 to 40 to 175 years in state prison for the sexual abuse</a>. The judge who sentenced him for the latter called it his "death warrant". The controversy also spread over to the entire USA Gymnastics organization and Michigan State University, both longtime employers of Nassar, which led to huge repercussions for both. USAG severed its ties with the K&aacute;rolyis during the sentencing phase of Nassar's state trial, leading to the closure of Karolyi Ranch. And then USAG itself filed for bankruptcy, shortly after the US Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee took the first steps toward stripping USAG of its role as the official US governing body for that sport.
</li><li> The steroid era has tainted numerous baseball players' legacies due to them either admitting to taking steroids, were caught, or were believed to have done so. Some of the most notable examples include Jose Canseco, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and Alex Rodriguez.
</li><li> Outside of his involvement in the MLB steroid controversy, Sammy Sosa is primarily known for the controversy surrounding his mysteriously lightening skin, later admitted to be the result of using bleaching creams; Sosa whitening his skin was heavily criticized as colorist, and eventually became a subject of mockery and further backlash after an infamous TV interview in 2018 where a combination of studio lighting and a poorly thought-out outfit <a class="urllink" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/XZS_Q3jt6UCFTqqNaT_hL0Io8-E=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IN3RVVWJMRHALAEBZDIQ5TVXGM.jpg">made his skin appear bright pink<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.
</li><li> Pete Rose was a highly popular baseball player and manager (even holding both positions simultaneously for a few years), beloved for his enthusiastic playing style, especially his tendency to dive at bases headfirst. He remains MLB's all-time leader in hits (4,256, which no player has come close to since) and holds several other records and awards as well. However, his career crashing down in 1989, when he was discovered to have placed bets on his own games and ejected from the game for life, as well as banned from induction into the Hall of Fame. He did get selected as a member of the "All-Century Team" in 1999, but the controversy still dogged him as he awkwardly had to respond to questions about the scandal rather than his accomplishments in the sport.
</li><li> Donald Sterling, then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, became one of the most infamous names in professional basketball overnight when private recordings of him making racist comments were released by TMZ in April 2014. After being hit with near-universal condemnation, he was banned from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">National Basketball Association</a> for life and fined $2.5 million by the league.
</li><li> Michael Vick is best known for the fact that he was discovered to had been running and participating in various dog fighting rings, which derailed his football career for a couple of years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConorMcGregor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConorMcGregor">Conor McGregor</a>, while still a popular mixed martial artist, is difficult to discuss without mentioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTysonZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTysonZone">his public life</a> and rowdy behavior.
</li><li> It's all but impossible to talk about mixed martial artist War Machine (born Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver) without talking about his numerous felony convictions, most notoriously the time when he vicious beat and raped his ex-girlfriend. It certainly doesn't help that his criminal behavior eventually got him an aggregate sentence of life in prison.
</li><li> Multiple sumo wrestlers (the most famous being Yamamotoyama Ry&#363;ta, the heaviest Japanese-born sumo wrestler in history) have had their careers irrevocably tainted when they were forced to retire by the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) after it found them guilty of match fixing in April 2011.

<ul><li> Super Bowl XXV will forever be remembered for the infamous Wide Right play where Bills kicker Scott Norwood missed a field goal by about a foot. Likewise, this play is the only thing anyone remembers about Norwood.
</li><li> Super Bowl XXXVIII is more known for the halftime show with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanetJackson">Janet Jackson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinTimberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunction</a> that took place in it than it is for the game itself.
</li><li> Super Bowl XLVII is primarily known for the power outage that took place during the second half of the game.
</li><li> Super Bowl LIII was infamous for several reasons:
<ul><li> Both the NFC and AFC Championship games were affected by questionable officiating,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2096fx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2096fx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2096fx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the NFC Championship, a case of pass-interference by the Los Angeles Rams, which should have given the New Orleans Saints an automatic first down, got missed, forcing the Saints to settle for a field goal and go into overtime, which the Rams ended up winning. In the AFC Championship, the Kansas City Chiefs were hit with a highly specious pass interference penalty halfway through the fourth quarter when Chris Jones lightly brushed Tom Brady on the shoulder; the resulting penalty helped the New England Patriots drive for a touchdown to take a 24-21 lead, and also ultimately winning in overtime.</span> leaving many people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">especially Saints fans</a>, feeling that neither team deserved to be there.
</li><li> It's regarded as perhaps the worst game in Super Bowl history, with a score of only 13-3.
</li><li> Following the death of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> creator Stephen Hillenburg, a petition was made to have the song "Sweet Victory", one of the show's most iconic musical numbers, played during the Super Bowl halftime show as a tribute to him. Despite the petition reaching its goal, and numerous teases that the NFL would indeed include the song in their halftime, the most glaring being that it was played prior to the game, "Sweet Victory" was never actually sung. This received widespread outrage from not only <em>SpongeBob</em> fans, but the animation community as a whole who felt that the NFL and PepsiCo disrespected Hillenberg's legacy and made the efforts to get them to have "Sweet Victory" sung for the halftime show feel pointless. There was, however, a brief animation of Squidward introducing the actual halftime singers, but many didn't think it was nearly enough, in addition to looking more like an incredibly blatant case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5">Maroon 5</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisScott">Travis Scott</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast">Big Boi</a>'s decisions to play at halftime were highly criticized, as many bands and musicians had previously turned down performing out of protest for the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and his parents gave a profoundly tone-deaf interview in which they proudly attributed his football skills to putting him through brutal corporal punishment in his childhood, including beating him with a belt to make him left-handed. Interviewer Tom Rinaldi also got quite a bit of flak for refusing to challenge this at all.
</li><li> Many NFL stars' careers have been derailed by scandals involving them abusing women (Ray Rice and Kareem Hunt to name a couple) or their children (Adrian Peterson).
</li><li> Aaron Hernandez is less known for being recognized as an All-American during his days at the University of Florida or being half of one of the NFL's most dominant tight end duos during his three seasons with the New England Patriots than he is for being convicted of the murder of Odin Lloyd and committing suicide in prison.
</li><li> Offensive guard Richie Incognito is most well-known for his ringleading role in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">bullying</a> of teammate Jonathan Martin which got him suspended from the Miami Dolphins (the team he was playing for at the time).
</li><li> Former Baltimore Colts player Jerry Richardson established the Carolina Panthers franchise in 1993, becoming the first former NFL player since George Halas to become a team owner. However, in 2017, allegations of him committing sexual harassment and using racial slurs were unearthed by <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, which led the NFL to fine him $2.75 million dollars the next year, and he would sell the team afterwards.
</li><li> Sal Alosi's career as a strength and conditioning coach has been eclipsed by multiple incidents during his involvement with the New York Jets. These incidents include him tripping Miami Dolphins gunner Nolan Carroll during a 2010 game, instructing inactive Jets players to line up along the sideline so as to potentially impede opposing players, getting into a fistfight with Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, and verbally abusing a chiropractor out of anger at "petty issues involving towels and water".
</li><li> Football commentator Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder was never completely free of controversy, due to his involvement in bookmaking and his feuds with sportscasters Brent Musburger and Phyllis George. That being said, he landed in some <em>very</em> hot water in 1988 due to him making some extremely questionable comments about African American athletes. One of the most infamous of these remarks was him claiming that African Americans were (supposedly) naturally superior athletes at least in part because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">black slaves in the Antebellum South had been selectively bred to produce more physically capable offspring</a>. Needless to say, he was quickly fired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a>, and what he said was widely condemned as both incredibly inaccurate and profoundly tone-deaf. Snyder sued in retaliation, but lost his lawsuit.
</li><li> English Rugby League footballer Terry Newton is most well-known for being one of the first athletes to test positive for human growth hormone, as well as for hanging himself while under he influence of drugs and alcohol.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>:
<ul><li> The 1936 Summer Olympics were notable for a number of reasons: they were the first Olympics to be televised, they introduced the Olympic torch relay, and coverage of the events pioneered many techniques now used in the filming of sports. But the games are mainly known for two things: Jesse Owens winning four gold medals, and the fact that they were hosted in Berlin during the era of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. Not helping this was the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> saw the games as an opportunity to promote his government and Nazi ideas of racial supremacy.
</li><li> The 1956 Summer Olympics are best known for the infamous "Blood in the Water" match, a violent, emotionally-charged water polo game between Hungary and the Soviet Union that occurred <strong>literally weeks</strong> after the latter's military put down the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956">former's revolution<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The 1968 Summer Olympics, held in Mexico City, were the first Olympic Games to be staged in Latin America and the first to be staged in a Spanish-speaking country. They were also the first to use an all-weather (smooth) track for track and field events instead of the traditional cinder track. But they're best known for three infamous controversies:
<ul><li> Students unhappy at the increasing brutality and authoritarianism of the Mexican government attempted to use the prominence brought by the Olympics to demand greater civil and democratic rights, staging protests in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco. Ten days before the games began, a mixed police and military force along with the Olympia Battalion (a secret joint force made up of soldiers, police officers and federal security agents) moved to break up the gathering. In the resulting Tlatelolco massacre, hundreds of protestors and civilians were killed and over 1000 were arrested. Though Mexico's government attempted to justify this bloodshed by claiming that the first shots had been fired by protestors, a 2001 investigation revealed that these "protestors" were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentProvocateur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentProvocateur">agent provocateurs</a>.
</li><li> While receiving their medals, African American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a black gloved fist in what's still considered one of the most overtly political statements in Olympic history. IOC president Avery Brundage considered what they did to be unfitting for the Olympics and ordered that they be suspended from the American team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the U.S. Olympic Committee refused, Brundage forced their compliance by threatening to ban the entire American track team if they didn't kick them out. Smith and Carlos would not participate in any future Olympic events. The third man on the podium, Australian Peter Norman, wore a human rights badge and stood in open solidarity with Smith and Carlos. As a result, he would share their fate by being quietly dropped from all future track events.
</li><li> Czechoslovakian gymnast V&#283;ra &#268;&aacute;slavsk&aacute; quietly turned her head down and away whenever the Soviet national anthem was played, in silent protest against the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia">Warsaw Pact invasion of her country<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This led to the new regime banning her from both sporting events and international travel for many years.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1972 Summer Olympics are best known for the Munich massacre, where eleven Israeli athletes were taken hostage and murdered by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, with some logistical assistance from West German neo-Nazis. A West German policeman was also killed during a failed attempt to rescue the hostages. It even overshadowed allegations that the men's basketball final was deliberately rigged against the American team, as well as <em>another</em> black power salute controversy.
</li><li> The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal saw Nadia Com&#259;neci earn the first perfect ten in gymnastics. However, in Canada at least, they are best known for the city of Montreal racking up an astronomical level of debt in order to pay for the staging of the games (the <em>720 percent</em> cost overrun for the games remains the highest in IOC history) and the (much-delayed) construction of the venues. A notable target is Olympic Stadium, which was not completed until long after the games were held, and which has been plagued with issues ever since. Its derisive nickname of "The Big Owe" is not far off the mark; its cost would not be fully paid off until 2006, by which time both of its post-Olympic tenants, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianFootballLeague">CFL's</a> Montreal Alouettes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">MLB's Montreal Expos</a>, had departed for pastures new.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21k9sy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21k9sy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21k9sy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Between 1976 and 2006, the Alouettes folded and revived <em>twice</em>. They eventually moved to the team's original home, a considerably older and smaller but far more centrally located stadium. As for the Expos, they moved south of the border to Washington, DC.</span> Costs aside, the Montreal Olympics were also known for a controversial ban of the Taiwanese team due to pressure from mainland China and a 29-country boycott owing to the IOC's refusal to ban the New Zealand team thanks to the New Zealand rugby team touring apartheid South Africa earlier that year. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Team Canada failed to win a single gold medal on home turf.</a>
</li><li> The 1980 Summer Olympics were and are best known for a large-scale boycott against them, resulting from them being held in Moscow during the widely-condemned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan">Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan</a>.
</li><li> Four years later, the Soviet Union and thirteen other countries retaliated by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingInstigatorOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingInstigatorOfDoom">which led to an extremely low point for the McDonald's promotional team</a>. It's hard to talk about either of these games without bringing up this fact.
</li><li> Much like the games that occurred 24 years beforehand, the 1996 Summer Olympics are also mostly known because of an infamous terrorist attack. In this case, it was the Centennial Olympic Park bombing, committed by an anti-abortion extremist named Eric Rudolph. Not only was the bombing itself one of the most well-known events of the games, it also sparked a related controversy after Richard Jewell &mdash; a security guard whose actions undoubtedly saved many lives &mdash; was falsely focused on as the presumed culprit by the news media, leading him to sue for defamation.
</li><li> The 2014 Winter Olympics had a whole bunch of controversies:
<ul><li> Some Circassian organizations objected to the games being held on land that was Circassian until 1864, and demanded that the games be cancelled or moved unless the Russian government apologized for the acts of ethnic cleansing Circassians suffered in the 19th century.
</li><li> Concerns were expressed over Russia's infamously homophobic policies, especially the notorious ban on "LGBT propaganda".
</li><li> Not helping Russia's image was the fact that severe cost overruns made these games the most expensive in Olympics history, which many commentators blamed on corruption.
</li><li> Probably the biggest controversy was the massive Russian state-sponsored doping program uncovered in the aftermath of the games, which resulted about a third of the Russian team being banned from the Rio Olympics (and later the <em>entire</em> Russian team being banned from both the Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 World Cup when Russia refused to comply with anti-doping rules).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The 2000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ParalympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ParalympicGames">Paralympic Games</a> in Sydney are best known for the Spanish Basketball ID team being stripped of their gold medals when an undercover reporter exposed that ten of the team's twelve members were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingDisability">just pretending to be mentally handicapped</a>. Allegedly, the Spanish Paralympic team did not administer the required IQ tests, and was intentionally letting non-disabled athletes in for other events so they could have a better chance at medals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">sponsorship deals</a>.
</li><li> South Korean baseball player Cho Sung-min's turbulent marriage to (and subsequent messy divorce from) actress Choi Jin-sil garnered considerably more media attention than his career, <em>especially</em> after he got arrested for beating her in 2004. After Choi committed suicide in 2008, Cho got into a messy custody battle with her family over the children he fathered with her. In 2012, he arrested again, this time for his involvement in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl">Bar Brawl</a>. The next year, he hanged himself.
</li><li> William D. Cox's time as owner of the Philadelphia Phillies was undoubtedly a time of great success for the team, though many players groused about his hands-on management style. Then he was accused of betting on his own team. He initially denied any wrongdoing on his part (though he did say some of his business associates bet on the Phillies), but was forced to cop to it as the investigation progressed. This resulted in him being suspended indefinitely.
</li><li> Former Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott was and is undoubtedly best known for the many, many offensive things said by her. These remarks include complaining about having to pay Jos&eacute; Rijo "three million to sit on his butt" while he was recovering from an elbow injury, being upset at the sudden death of umpire John McSherry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">because it would postpone a game</a>, saying that she didn't want her players to wear earrings because "only fruits wear earrings", and <em>especially</em> her numerous racist comments and apparent Nazi sympathies.
</li><li> The 1996 boxing match between Bruce Sheldon and Mike Tyson is notable for being Tyson's final heavyweight championship victory. But to most people, it's best known for being the fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TupacShakur">Tupac Shakur</a> attended on the night he was fatally shot.
</li><li> Matt Kuchar became the most hated person in golf after his caddy for a tournament in Mexico complained about being paid just a tiny fraction of what's typical for the sport. He didn't help himself at all with a response that basically the guy should be thankful for any scraps Kuchar deigned to toss his way, making himself look both racist and elitist in a sport that's been trying extremely hard to distance itself from that reputation. After months of public shaming from both the general public and numerous other golfers, he finally coughed up what he should have paid.
</li><li> Australian rugby player Israel Folau has become better known for his staunch homophobia than for his rugby career. Rugby Australia was also criticized for refusing to punish him, although they did eventually draw the line in May 2019 and banned him.
</li><li> Frank Winterstein, another Australian rugby player, has been hit with this, not over his own behavior but that of his his wife, social media influencer and anti-vax zealot Taylor Winterstein. Thanks in large part to a fearmongering campaign by Winterstein in her native Samoa, vaccination rates on the island plummeted and triggered a huge measles outbreak that infected 5,700 people and killed 83.
</li><li> Bob Knight was one of college basketball's most successful and innovative coaches. However, most people know him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">his volatile temper and violent behavior</a>, especially infamous episodes like him throwing a chair across the court during a game, being recorded on video grabbing one of his players by the neck, and getting arrested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PuertoRico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PuertoRico">Puerto Rico</a> for assaulting a cop. These incidents and others eventually led to him being fired by Indiana University.
</li><li> Al Campanis was the first Greek-American player in MLB history, and spent nearly twenty years as general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Nevertheless, it's hard to talk about him without bringing up an interview he had on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nightline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nightline">Nightline</a></em> where he told Ted Koppel that blacks were often poor swimmers because "they don't have the buoyancy" and seemingly implied that they didn't have the necessary intelligence to be managers. He was fired less than 48 hours after this interview.
</li><li> Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson is undoubtedly best-known for being caught doping multiple times, which led to multiple awards and records of his being rescinded, and eventually ended his career. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">refusal to accept responsibility</a> certainly hasn't helped.
</li><li> Once upon a time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidIcke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidIcke">David Icke</a> was famous for his career as a footballer-turned-sports broadcaster. Then in the early 1990s, he claimed to be a "Son of the Godhead" and predicted that the world would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeweyDefeatsTruman">soon</a> be devastated by geological natural disasters, statements which turned him from a respected household name to a laughingstock overnight. Nowadays, he's now best known by far for his belief that the Earth has been hijacked by interdimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReptilians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReptilians">reptilian beings</a> known as the Archons that feed on fear (something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">even notorious conspiracy theorist Alex Jones thinks is insane</a>), as well as accusations that he's an anti-Semite.
</li><li> Avery Brundage is regarded as a highly influential figure in the modern Olympics; however, several of his influences are among his more questionable qualities, such as his obvious racism, particularly on display in the 1936, 1968, and 1972 Games, and his close ties to the Nazi Party, which remained even after its dissolution.
</li><li> NBA referee Tim Donaghy officiated in 772 regular season games and twenty playoff games over the course of thirteen years. But he's best known for his role in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal">2007 NBA betting scandal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which forced him to resign from the league and got him sent to federal prison.
</li><li> Boxing promoter Don King helped promote some of the most prominent names in the sport, as well as iconic matches like the Rumble in the Jungle and the Thrilla in Manilla. Nevertheless, he's an infamous figure for rumored ties to organized crime, allegedly cheating and threatening multiple boxers, and having killed two people.
</li><li> Former baseball pitcher turned sports commentator Curt Schilling is known nowadays for his far-right political views, including some Islamophobic comments that got him fired from Fox Sports, and mocking a transgender coworker, which got him fired from ESPN. He has since become a political propagandist for the alt-right and a contributor to Breitbart, further disassociating him from sports.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> champion Bobby Fischer became known in later years for disavowing his Jewish heritage and becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">antisemitic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> (notably blaming 9/11 on the Jewish people), which pretty much put a damper on his legacy.
</li><li> Hansie Cronje, the South African cricketer, used to be recognized as one of the greatest captains at the international level. That was until his involvement in a match fixing scandal came to light, which is what he is mostly remembered for since then.
</li><li> Baseball player Roberto Osuna received a year-long suspension in 2018 for allegedly assaulting his son's mother. The case ended inconclusively and he was quickly snapped up by the Astros after the suspension ended, but any chance of his being known for anything else ended at the 2019 World Series, when Astros assistant manager Brandon Taubman bizarrely went out of his way to draw attention to it, shouting to three female reporters (including one wearing a bracelet promoting awareness of domestic violence) "I&#146;m so fucking glad we got Osuna," when he hadn't even been particularly notable in the game just played. The rest of the team&#146;s management then accused the reporters of completely making the story up despite numerous witnesses, until they were finally forced to admit it was true and fire Taubman a few days later. Meanwhile, Osuna himself understandably just tried to keep completely out of the whole mess.
</li><li> The Houston Astros then got hit <em>again</em> when it was discovered that during the 2017 season in which they won the World Series they had engaged in a sophisticated cheating system by which an Astros staffer would watch the live video feed in the "replay room", decipher the catcher's signs, and then players would relay to the batter via banging on a trash can what pitch was coming. The scheme was revealed by former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers, who then cooperated in the investigation. The fallout cost Astros General Manager Jeff Lunhow and Manager A.J. Hinch their jobs (as well as both being suspended for a year), and also led to resignations by Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora (who was the Astros bench coach in 2017) and New York Mets Manager Carlos Beltr&aacute;n (a former Astros outfielder who was named as the "ringleader" by MLB's investigation). The Astros also were fined $5 million dollars and stripped of their 2020 and 2021 first-round picks in the MLB Draft.
</li><li> In most countries, French footballer Thierry Henry is regarded as one of the best players and has won many honours, including League titles in France, England and Spain, the Champions League, the European Championship and World Cup. In addition, he is also France's highest-ever goal scorer. In Ireland, however, he&#146;s remembered as the player who handled the ball in the build-up to the goal that cost them a place at the 2010 World Cup.
</li><li> The 1985 European Cup Final saw Juventus become the first team to win all three European club competitions<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22gzsb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22gzsb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22gzsb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the European Cup (now Champions League), the UEFA Cup (now Europa League) and the European Cup Winners' Cup</span>. It also saw a riot before the match, which resulted in the deaths of 39 Juventus fans and saw English clubs indefinitely banned from UEFA's competitions (which, except for Liverpool - who, being deemed responsible, were banned for an extra year - was lifted in 1990).
</li><li> The 1989 FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest is almost exclusively remembered for the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster">Hillsborough disaster<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an infamous human crush that killed 96 spectators.
</li><li> The Greek footballer Giorgos Katidis is largely remembered as the player who gave a Nazi salute to the crowd after scoring a goal, which got him indefinitely banned from all Greek national teams.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">1981 Indianapolis 500</a> is infamous for two near-fatal incidents and, more famously in latter days, Bobby Unser passing fourteen lapped cars under yellow, which, at the time, was against the rules but went unnoticed, and ABC's very biased reporting of the incident. Unser was stripped of his win, then having it reinstated, costing him $1 million in commercial endorsements by his estimate and essentially forcing him to retire from racing, which only added to the controversy (and the legend of the Andretti Curse). Unser and Andretti were close friends prior to this, and it took 37 years before they finally buried the hatchet.
</li><li> The 1996 Indianapolis 500 was overshadowed by the "split" between Championship Auto Racing Teams and the Indy Racing League, especially since the latter was a "spec series" that many of the previous winners refused to participate in leaving the field for the crown jewel of American open-wheel racing to be filled with relative unknowns, unproven rookies, and aging "backmarkers". Then, the IRL announced a controversial "25/8" rule that guaranteed the top 25 IRL cars were automatically "locked in" and only the remaining 8 positions in the field would be open to qualifying on speed, which shattered the 80+ year tradition of only the "fastest 33" making it (and part of the reason why CART drivers refused to participate).
</li><li> The 1896 heavyweight championship boxing match of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzsimmons_vs._Sharkey">Bob Fitzsimmons vs. Tom Sharkey<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is best known for having been fixed, as well as accusations that referee Wyatt Earp (yes, <em>that</em> Wyatt Earp) was involved with the fix. Earp's calling of the match was so criticized at the time that it followed him for years afterwards, to the point it was reported that when he died in 1929, he was perhaps more well-known for his decision in the title fight than his actions at the O.K. Corral gunfight (for which he would become better-known after his death).
</li><li> In perhaps the oldest case of this happening in the world of sport, the January 13, 532, chariot races at the Hippodrome of Constantinople are notorious for being the event that sparked the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots">Nika riots<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Uruguayan footballer Luis Su&aacute;rez is often regarded as one of the best players of the 21st century. This is presumably overlooked by Otman Bakkal, Branislav Ivanovi&amp;cacute; and Giorgio Chellini, all of whom he has bitten during his career. It is no doubt also overlooked by Patrice Evra, who he racially abused during a game (and then refused to shake Evra's hand when their respective clubs next met). Or by Fulham fans after making an obscene gesture towards them. And all his awards and achievements are definitely overlooked by anybody of Ghanaian descent after saving the ball <em>with his hands</em> in the last few minutes of extra time in their quarter-final in the 2010 World Cup; had the ball gone in, Ghana would have become the first African team to ever make it to a World Cup semifinal. He then added insult to injury by celebrating the resulting penalty hitting the crossbar. (Ghana would then lose the penalty shoot-out. Unsurprisingly, he was booed every time he touched the ball in the third-place play-off, having been banned in the semifinal.)
</li><li> Egyptian former judoka Islam El Shehaby saw his reputation tarnished overnight when, after being defeated at the 2016 Summer Olympics by Israeli Or Sasson, he refused to shake Sasson's hand. This display of poor sportsmanship earned him widespread ire, the sardonic moniker "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming">Islam El SheBaby</a>", and a severe reprimand from the Disciplinary Committee of the IOC. He was sent home before the closing ceremony, and the backlash was so severe that he retired from judo.
</li><li> Japanese judoka Masato Uchishiba won two olympic gold medals, among other awards. But nowadays, he's far more well known for allegations that he committed sexual harassment during his time coaching the women's judo team at Kyushu University of Nursing and Social Welfare, along with a 2013 sexual misconduct conviction.

Things were looking up for the owners at White Wolf, with a launch that could rival <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> in popularity. <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180708153619/http://www.dogwithdice.com/whitewolfaredead/">Then people discovered some unfortunate<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> ties to alt-right ideology in the test material and Quickstart guide. White Wolf was slow to address the storm of anger brewing on internet, and the article's writer claimed to have been contacted by White Wolf's attorneys with a threat of lawsuits if the article wasn't taken down. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect">This went as well as could be expected</a>. Soon the TTRPG community associated Fifth Edition with alt-right ideology, and White Wolf rushed out an apology, claimed the whole thing was a coincidence, and included a denunciation of the alt-right in the main rulebook.
</li><li> If White Wolf mortally wounded their brand with the Quickstart guide, they would kill it when they dropped the Camarilla Sourcebook. The book treated the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gay_purges_in_Chechnya">still-ongoing terror campaign against homosexuals in Chechnya<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as a plot point for vampire shenanigans. The Chechen Government threatened to sue White Wolf, claiming the concentration camps where journalists have documented the torture and murders are <em>still</em> taking place are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoveAlongNothingToSeeHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoveAlongNothingToSeeHere">actually completely normal prisons and there couldn't be a gay pogrom because "there are no gay people in Chechnya!"</a> This was the final straw for White Wolf and ultimately resulted in it being folded into their parent company, Paradox Interactive.

<ul><li> Among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s works, the most polarizing in modern times are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>, which are well known for their notoriously unflattering depictions of women and Jews, respectively. Modern productions of both typically add some sort of twist to reduce the uncomfortableness, up to and including staging the plays, intended to be comedies, as tragedies with the female and Jewish characters as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor">Doomed Moral Victors</a>. Even within Shakespeare's own lifetime, there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> play called <em>The Tamer Tamed</em> where Katherine's abuser gets a taste of his own medicine from his next wife. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TitusAndronicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TitusAndronicus">Titus Andronicus</a></em> is also well-known for being an extremely dark and violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a> revenge tragedy very much unlike any of the Bard's other works, including the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">rape scene</a> he ever wrote and even cannibalism.
</li><li> The mid-Victorian play <em>Our American Cousin</em> would forever be remembered for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Lincoln assassination</a> instead of the witty characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Lord Dundreary</a>. The fatal shot was actually timed to what was famously the play's funniest moment, in the hope that the roar of laughter would cover the noise of the gunshot. In addition, John Wilkes Booth was a well known and critically acclaimed stage actor at the time. Nowadays, he's only remembered, obviously not without reason, as one of the most notorious criminals in American history.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRiteOfSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRiteOfSpring">The Rite of Spring</a></em> is cherished for its avant-garde music and choreography, its premiere night in 1913 sparked a near-riot inside the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es in Paris when the audience turned against each other on whether it was groundbreaking or sheer crap, with the latter throwing stuff on the orchestra and the dancers. It didn't help that inside the curtain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IgorStravinsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IgorStravinsky">the composer</a> and lead choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">had cooperation issues</a> during the production.

</li><li> <em>Nord-Ost</em>, a Russian musical, is better remembered as the target of the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis than as a work in itself.

What's she best known for these days? Her major mishandling of her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpiderManTurnOffTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpiderManTurnOffTheDark">Turn Off the Dark</a></em>, which was plagued by, in addition to bad writing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">prima donna antics by Taymor herself</a>, numerous accidents involving the aforementioned elaborate props and costumes, some of which even resulted in serious injuries. In the end, she was unceremoniously given the boot from her own show and has done little of note since.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewLloydWebber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewLloydWebber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LoveNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LoveNeverDies">Love Never Dies</a></em>, the twenty-years-later follow-up to his smash hit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em>, was never able to rise above the stigma of being a sequel that nobody but Lloyd Webber himself really wanted. It was based on a poorly regarded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel">Fan Sequel</a> novel called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfManhattan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfManhattan">The Phantom of Manhattan</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomSpecificPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomSpecificPlot">contained cliches that have appeared in fan works of dubious quality for decades</a>, including Christine giving birth to the Phantom's illegitimate child after a one-night stand and deciding he was her true love after all, and her kindly love interest Raoul <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">having become</a> a neglectful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">drunkard</a> who's blown his fortune at the gambling table. All of this resulted in considerable fan opposition before it even came out (including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> campaign called #LoveShouldDie) and a general sense that the show was Lloyd Webber's terrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">Draco in Leather Pants</a> fanfic that he forced onto the stage with his piles of money, and despite having the <em>Phantom</em> name and Lloyd Webber's own behind it, the initial run received mediocre reviews and closed at a loss - though the show later picked up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">cult following in Australia</a>, where a more polished production was staged and filmed. 
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a>'s stage adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em> was sued months before its debut by Harper Lee's estate, who accused it of straying too far from the source material against Lee's instructions from her will. This includes some already controversial elements from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoSetAWatchman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoSetAWatchman">Go Set a Watchman</a></em> like Atticus having some racist leanings, and with Sorkin himself already being such a polarizing figure, the show has quite a hole to dig itself out of.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carousel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carousel">Carousel</a></em> has several individual songs that have become classics, such as "If I Loved You" and "You'll Never Walk Alone", if you haven't seen it yourself, most likely the only thing you know about the actual plot is its extreme level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>: the main character is a sympathetically-portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">wife-beater</a>, and the play includes a scene where his wife defends his actions.

The segment has become rather infamous for driving many theatre groups to rework it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">to avoid alienating the audience</a>; some productions change the narrator's age from 13 to 16, others have omitted the controversial line <em>"If it was rape, it was a good rape"</em>, and still others have elected to cut the entire segment.
</li><li> The only real impact left by the play <em>All in a Row</em> is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/12/casting-puppet-as-autistic-child-step-backwards-new-play-row-other-actors-played-by-humans">the outrage it caused<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for having an autistic character portrayed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">creepy puppet</a> contrasting a cast full of humans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnnieGetYourGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnnieGetYourGun">Annie Get Your Gun</a></em> is another one now known almost entirely for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. It was created at the end of World War II specifically to encourage women who'd joined the workforce while their husbands were fighting the Axis to go back and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a>, and thus reworks the true story of sharpshooter Annie Oakley to have her future husband Frank Butler refuse to be with a woman who's a better shot than him, so she ends up throwing a contest between them and retiring, when in real life it was actually Butler who gave up his sharpshooting career to support hers. It also features some horrific portrayals of Native Americans, with the reveal that they're not just mindless savages intended to be played for surprise laughs, and the song "I'm an Indian, Too" which brutally mocks their naming style. A 1999 revival heavily revised it to fit contemporary attitudes, cutting the insulting Native material and having Butler catch on to what Annie's doing and throw his own shots to end the contest with a tie.
</li><li> <em>The Death of Klinghoffer</em>, an opera about the murder of Leon Klinghoffer by Palestinian terrorists who hijacked the Italian passenger liner MS <em>Achille Lauro</em>, is better known for accusations of being anti-Semitic and/or too sympathetic to the hijackers than for its actual content.

Problems included poorly designed and maintained rides, untrained teenage employees, terrible communication with its (often non-English speaking) visitors, lax safety rules, and high levels of drunkenness among both staff and riders. Its abysmal safety record led to the park gaining the nicknames &#147;Traction Park&#148;, &#147;Accident Park&#148;, and &#147;Class Action Park&#148;. Case in point: Action Park&#146;s most notorious ride was <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Action_Park_looping_water_slide.jpg">Cannonball Loop<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, a water slide with <em>a complete vertical loop</em> built into it.

Things have gotten slightly better following SeaWorld announcing the termination of the orca breeding programs, but some grievances still remain.
</li><li> The Schlitterbahn water park chain experienced controversy in August 2016 after the death of a ten-year-old boy (the son of a local politician) on the tallest waterslide in the world (called "Verr&uuml;ckt") at its Kansas City location, thus leading to the permanent shutdown of the slide. But it got worse after an indictment of park higher-ups was released in 2018. It implied that the slide's designer had no official engineering degree, the ride was known to be dangerous well before the fatality happened, and it was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/article206605804.html">intentionally kept that way<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> so the park could chase money from TV networks regarding their record-breaking attraction.

Regardless of how well the resort does in the future, it's doubtful that mainstream pop culture will be willing to let Disney forget about those troubled first years any time soon, especially after being the subject of many jokes at Disney's expense.

America Sings would continue to operate until it was permanently closed in 1988.
</li></ul></li><li> Now-defunct Christian theme park Heritage USA, which was built and owned by televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, is now known largely for two things: that time Jerry Falwell went down one of its water slides while wearing a suit, and the fact that some of the money used to build it was collected from members of the Bakkers' audience under the pretense of funding overseas missions.

The manufacturers were quick to defend that no such hacking incidents have taken place outside of proof-of-concept demonstrations, and it involves people with the know-how to do so (not that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">determined creep</a> can't do it, at least hypothetically), but even then, the audio advertising and data collection by the dolls especially in this day and age where paranoia over privacy after Snowden's NSA expos&eacute; is quite common, is certainly alarming.

<ul><li> The webcomic is more well known for the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">Loss</a>" (or "CADbortion") arc which is legendary for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> and writer Tim Buckley's online behavior than anything else. Accusations of being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> knockoff haven't helped and likely played a part in the comic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">Retool</a>.
</li><li> It is also known for an incident in which Buckley had a fan animation taken down, made a response that outright insulted the creator, and threatened to sue them, despite previously saying he was okay with fan works. This move was widely criticized, especially after the ill-regarded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em> was already considered a terrible webcomic to begin with, but it is more or less overshadowed by numerous controversies:
<ul><li> Perhaps what it's best known for is the bizarre actions and the personal life of its author, Chris-chan. To this day, the comic is known almost entirely for its creator's various antics rather than its content.
</li><li> For people who are interested in the comic due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">Bile Fascination</a> nature, Issues <em>#8</em> and <em>#10</em> are more or less remembered for the extremely graphic sex scenes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">in a comic that is supposed to be for all ages</a> and the graphic murders of people related to the parody comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Asperchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Asperchu">Asperchu</a></em>, respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Sonic</em> webcomic <em>Other M</em>, once extremely popular, now is mostly remembered for being written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">future Archie</a> <em>Sonic</em> writer Ian Flynn, and for having one of the villains be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">Knuckles</a>, who is portrayed as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobe</a>. This move received much scorn and has literally overshadowed every other plot element, including the fact that it takes place in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>.
</li><li> Pepe the Frog, a character from the comic <em>Boy's Club</em>, became a widespread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">meme</a> after his debut in 2005. However, the usage of Pepe as a meme turned awry in mid-2016 when many members of the alt-right used him as a symbol to express racist and anti-Semitic sentiments around the time of the 2016 U.S. election.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23qmx8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note23qmx8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23qmx8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's possible that <em>some</em> of the offensive Pepe memes, especially those from before 2016, were originally meant more as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VulgarHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VulgarHumor">Vulgar Humor</a> than serious political statements, since other "Rare Pepes" often featured gratuitous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>, coprophilia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a>, and various sex acts instead of racist imagery, all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">played for extremely dark laughs</a>, until genuine bigots started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">blurring the lines between satire and serious</a>.</span> The damage had been done by the time the Anti-Defamation League classified Pepe as a hate symbol.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note247gd0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note247gd0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note247gd0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though they did include the caveat that Pepe is not <em>inherently</em> a hate symbol and context should be taken into account when judging whether using him is hateful.</span> Matt Furie, the creator of Pepe, was so angry over this that he attempted a "Save Pepe" campaign in order to rescue the character. However, in May 2017, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyFandomCantHaveNiceThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyFandomCantHaveNiceThings">Furie decided to kill off Pepe in his comic</a>. Over time, the Pepe meme has become more and more ingrained as a symbol of the far-right as a whole, due to media insistence, to the point where fast food chain Wendy's was criticized for tweeting <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Wendys/status/816683405286981632">a non-racist image of Pepe dressed as their mascot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and clothing store Zara was forced to pull <a class="urllink" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/245/130/008.jpg">a skirt with an image of a frog that vaguely resembled Pepe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. Furie did succeed in enforcing his copyright in certain cases, such as forcing <em>InfoWars</em>'s Alex Jones to pay $15,000 in a lawsuit for selling merchandise with Pepe on it, but the reputation as a political meme is very hard to erase.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest">Sinfest</a></em> was initially known for its raunchy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">dark</a> comedy and its lighthearted parodies of religious tropes, but it is now more often remembered for 2011's Sisterhood/Patriarchy arc, where the comic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilibusterFreefall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilibusterFreefall">suddenly became</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> reflecting the author's trans-exclusionary radical feminist values, complete with significant changes to the personality of several characters.
</li><li> When Dave Cheung's name is brought up, it tends to be in the context of one or more of the following topics: a very clumsy attempt to tell people to stop demanding explicit material in <em>Chugworth Academy</em>, drawing an incredibly demeaning comic about Jade Raymond (which he yelled at the DeviantART mods over when they yanked it), or the entirety of <em>US Angel Corps</em>' first iteration, a murder-porn comic infamous for its deeply misogynistic overtones, graphic gory violence, and fetishization of rape, necrophilia, and suffering in general; while it was done primarily on commission, it was still Cheung's idea to begin with.
</li><li> <em>Leasebound</em>, a webcomic about a lesbian bouncer, has been overshadowed by the controversy that erupted after the release of its fourth chapter in February 2019, which contained three characters whose treatment in the webcomic raised allegations of transphobia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DarASuperGirlyTopSecretComicDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DarASuperGirlyTopSecretComicDiary">DAR! A Super Girly Top Secret Comic Diary</a></em> and the NSFW sex toy / sex education site <em>Oh Joy Sex Toy</em> aren't respected by a lot of people due to controversial statements from artist Erika Moen. The most cited examples from the former are the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesbianUntilGraduation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesbianUntilGraduation">L.U.G.</a>" comic, where Erika describes herself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">"lesbian with an exception"</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25q1xg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25q1xg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25q1xg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">she would later describe herself as simply "queer"</span> and depicts her boyfriend casually using the word "dyke" and him and Erika expressing sexual desires towards a visibly displeased woman, and a comic where Erika openly admits to fetishizing trans men. While Erika has presumably changed her mind since <em>DAR</em> as <em>Oh Joy</em> tries very hard to be inclusive, the latter's features on certain controversial fetishes have made it a subject of disgust or mockery to many, <em>especially</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">infamous comic</a> on the cuckolding fetish.
