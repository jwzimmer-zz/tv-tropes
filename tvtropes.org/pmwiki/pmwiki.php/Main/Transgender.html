(Which is why in some countries, a birth certificate will now say "sex" instead of gender, leaving it up to the individual to find out instead.) Gender falls on a big gradient &mdash; some people are strictly male or female, and others have aspects of both, or are neither.
</p><p>Transgender people can experience gender dysphoria (distress caused by the sex or gender assigned to them at birth) on physical or social levels, and can pursue medical means (e.g. hormone replacement, surgery, etc.) to help mitigate this discomfort. Others don't pursue medical treatment for various reasons &mdash; for example, because they don't experience discomfort, because socially transitioning is enough for them, or because no available medical options fit their gender. Since medical science has only been able to alleviate dysphoria for about a century, the vast majority of transgender people in history did not have the option to change their bodies, and many today still don't have access to medical transitioning options (either due to prohibitive costs, health issues, or the practice being outlawed in certain countries).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Transgender people aren't a new group; their existence has been documented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">throughout history</a>, but they're typically discriminated against in their respective societies, which clouds their visibility. They're often used as a source of interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict">Conflict</a> in a story, partly because their coming-out stories can depict change very visually. See the Useful Notes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Transgender">Transgender</a> people for a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>-oriented and complete description. There's a general craving by most of the trans community for more representation of them as just regular people &mdash; just like not every female character's story has to be about battling sexism or traditional gender roles and people of color don't have to be defined by their race, many trans people too would like to see themselves depicted in all traditional narratives.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Note that an older term now considered more outdated would be <strong>transsexual</strong>, which is often used in older contexts up until fairly relatively recently. The language around trans discourse changes very rapidly, due to being de-pathologised and re-written by trans people themselves instead of by outside onlookers. The demarcation between gender, sex, gender expression and orientation is also subject to constant historical and cultural shifts in perspective &mdash; the realisation that these are different things with only some overlapping points is slowly seeping into our modern narratives. This should be kept in mind with context to older media and stories from foreign cultures. As a matter of fact, there is still a lot that isn't understood, and because research on the subject is always yielding new discoveries in relatively quick succession, in addition to shifting societal norms and growing understanding that even biology isn't as cut-and-dry as it once was thought to be. It's best to keep an open mind as previously rigidly held, commonplace ideas are constantly challenged.
</p><p>Now for some definitions of the terminology involved:
</p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminology&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <strong>AGAB</strong> (Assigned Gender At Birth), which can be; <strong>AFAB</strong> (Assigned Female At Birth) and <strong>AMAB</strong> (Assigned Male At Birth) refer to the interpretation of a person's genitals by doctors/their parents at birth. Variations on these terms include FAAB (Female Assigned At Birth), CAFAB and CAMAB (Coercively Assigned Female/Male At Birth), AXAB (Assigned Intersex At Birth), UAB (Unassigned At Birth), and so on. Calling someone's body a "female body" or "male body" can be misleading &mdash; it's always up to trans people themselves what words they use for their parts. It's also rude to ask a transgender person what they look like under their clothes, as those questions are invasive and privacy-violating (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">"Anyway, how's your sex life?"</a>). A person can decide to share that, but if they don't, DON'T ASK. Same goes for transition-related questions. If you aren't close enough to someone to ask for intensely personal medical details about their genitals, don't make an exception for people who are already going through a lot of stigma.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser">Crossdresser and Transvestite</a></strong> refer to wearing clothing that's traditionally culturally coded as belonging to a different gender. They may or may not be used interchangeably and <em>don't</em> automatically entail either transgenderism or homosexuality, but they also don't preclude either. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvestic_fetishism">That other wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has an entry for "transvestic fetishism". Transvestite is often considered an offensive term because of its history, and shouldn't be used to refer to people who crossdress and/ or are trans although this again strongly depends on culture.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen">Drag Queens</a> and Drag Kings</strong> are performers who dress as a caricature of gender. Drag performers may or may not be on the trans spectrum, but the majority are cisgender and only dress up to entertain. They are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> men or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButchLesbian">Butch Lesbians</a> in their day-to-day lives, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransEqualsGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransEqualsGay">the mistaken notion that all trans people are "just super-gay"</a>. The history of drag is deeply interlinked with the trans community; many trans people use drag performance as their sole outlet if circumstances don't allow them to fully transition. Note that anyone of any gender can do drag (sex isn't relevant at all); cis women in lady drag and cis men in guy drag are also part of this community, commonly known as "bio-" or "faux-" queens/kings" in the drag community.
</li><li> <strong>Cisgender</strong> or just <strong>cis</strong> is the opposite of transgender. A cis person is someone whose gender identity matches the one they were assigned at birth. "Cis-" is the Latin prefix that is the opposite of "trans," meaning "not across," as used in chemistry or "cisatlantic/transatlantic." Non-trans is also used. Saying "normal" or "real" instead of cis is considered offensive for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">implying that trans people aren't</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">really</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">male/female/nonbinary</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Gender</strong> is someone's innate mental blueprint of how male and/or female they are (this is specifically known as a Gender Identity<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06yck');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note06yck" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06yck');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As with sexuality, everyone has one even if it aligns with the majority of people</span>. Gender is on a massive gradient with many different points. It can fluctuate over time for some people, but on the whole it seems to be immune to outside influence. Gender <em>roles</em>, on the other hand, are a changeable social construct, and include things like "girls like pink" or "the English word for men is he."
</li><li> <strong>Gender dysphoria</strong> means discomfort that can arise when someone's gender, sex and social roles are mismatched. It can be further split into physical <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1e4wv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1e4wv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1e4wv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">dysphoria from one's own body not matching that typical of a member of one's gender</span>; social<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2l9eo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2l9eo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2l9eo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">dysphoria from being perceived and treated as a member of a gender other than one's own</span>; and mental<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3cg54');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3cg54" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3cg54');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">having thoughts and reactions one feels are improper for a member of one's gender</span>. Not all trans people experience dysphoria, although some define dysphoria simply as the mismatch itself (leading to many, <em> many</em> internet arguments over semantics). The opposite is gender euphoria, which is the happy feeling when someone's gender, sex and social roles finally <em>do</em> match up.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerAsTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerAsTropes">Homosexuality</a></strong> means being sexually and romantically attracted to people of the same gender. Trans people can have any sexual orientation, and are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransEqualsGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransEqualsGay">just gay people</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>." For example, a transgender man who is solely attracted to women is not a lesbian since he's neither a woman nor gay (hence why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claudine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claudine">Claudine...!</a></em> is not really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">Yuri Genre</a> manga despite sometimes being mistaken for one). The "T" is in "LGBT" because transphobia and homophobia have similar motives &mdash; both stem from the idea of how a person "should be" according to their assigned sex.
</li><li> <strong><a class="urllink" href="http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex">"Intersex"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></strong> refers to a development of genitals, hormones and/or chromosomes that don't match biological norms of "male" or "female". It is approximately as common as having red hair. Intersex People are sometimes called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hermaphrodite">Hermaphrodite</a>" depending on culture, though this is seen by many as an outdated slur. Intersex people can have male, female or non-binary genders, and may identify as transgender if their gender doesn't match their bodies or their assigned gender / social roles. The exact link between intersex conditions and being trans is currently being scientifically explored.
</li><li> <strong>Misgendering</strong> means that you refer to a person (usually, but not always a trans and/or inter person) in a way that doesn't fit their gender. For trans people it's mostly their <strong>dead name</strong>, a birth name they no longer go by. It can happen by accident<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note46cmb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note46cmb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note46cmb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if it does, it can be easily corrected by saying "sorry" and using the right name or pronoun</span>, it can happen if a trans person isn't out (to that person) yet. Quite often, however, it's used to imply that their gender, name, and/or identity is "fake"; if done with this intent it's a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming">Malicious Misnaming</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Non-binary</strong>, agender and related words describe genders that aren't strictly male or female. The knowledge of gender as a gradient appears throughout world history &mdash; non-binary is a recent Western umbrella term for this knowledge and includes many points on the gender spectrum. Synonyms include genderqueer, gender variant, third gender and androgynous, all of which have their own connotations and cultural histories. People whose gender varies over time may choose the word genderfluid, and people who don't experience any gender may call themselves agender. Different cultures have tons of different words. There are many points on the cis-to-trans scale, and it's important to keep in mind that distress over one's body is never a prerequisite.
</li><li> <strong>Passing</strong> refers to a transgender persons ability to be perceived as their gender (with or without being recognised as trans). It's a rather nebulous and controversial concept, with many debates within trans spaces raging over whether trans people who pass better are better off than those who don't. It's also rarely as simple as being seen as one's gender 100% of the time (for example, a trans man might pass at a glance, or in his photos on social media, but not in a direct conversation; a trans woman might pass when she's putting a lot of energy into her appearance, but can't pass when she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriouslyScruffy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriouslyScruffy">pressed for time</a>; a genderfluid person<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vdhj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5vdhj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vdhj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Someone whose gender shifts between two or more gender identities</span> might not pass as well as one gender as another). It's also not much of a factor for nonbinary people, for obvious reasons.
</li><li> <strong>Sex</strong> are physical traits that are seen as "male" or "female": genitals, chromosomes, hormones, hair growth, etc. Like gender, sex is on a gradient with many points in between male and female. Unlike gender, most parts of one's sex can be medically altered, which many trans people are happy to do if they have the means. The term "biological" sex is often used to describe someone's sexual characteristics at birth, but it's quickly falling out of favor as it implies people's gender being less biological than the rest of them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6hbks');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6hbks" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6hbks');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Gender was actually coined in the 50's to refer to the psychological aspects of sex, which would now specifically be called "Gender Identity". It picked up its more moderning meaning (as mentioned above) during second wave feminist discourse in the 70's; refusing to accept the existance of gender is why some anti-trans groups call themselves "gender critical" &mdash; they reject the idea that gender even exists and adamantly insist someone must be defined by their AGAB.</span>.
</li><li> <strong>Trans</strong> is used as an umbrella term for all non-cis people, and is short for "transgender".
</li><li> <strong>Transitioning</strong> is when a trans person changes their appearance and/or social roles to match their gender. This can be broken down into:
<ul><li> <strong>Social Transition</strong> is the process of moving into the social role of one's gender. It can consist of things like picking a new wardrobe, changing names and pronouns, and generally trying to be legally recognised as the gender you identify with. Many trans people simply do this (especially nonbinary people), and don't feel the need for medical intervention (although many jurisdictions require some degree of medical transition to recognise it legally). Sometimes the term <em>Legal Transition</em> is used to further distinguish the paper work from the more specifically social aspects (such as using one's new name, and asking people to use the correct pronouns).
</li><li> <strong>Medical Transition</strong> is the term used specifically for physically changing one's body to match what is typically expected of one's gender identity, either to alleviate physical dysphoria, or reduce the chance of being misgendered (and thus social dysphoria). This can include taking hormones (or puberty blockers for trans people who come out at younger ages), and surgical alteration of the body. The term "sex change" is an old-fashioned and overly simplistic description of many different surgical procedures. The preferred term for genital surgery is "gender confirmation/reassignment surgery" or the more specific terms "phalloplasty" and "vaginaplasty"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7j8lk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7j8lk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7j8lk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although both terms themselves cover multiple types of surgery with subtly different goals and success rates, and the technology is naturally always improving</span>. Colloquially mastectomies/breast augmentation and GCS are known as top surgery and bottom surgery, respectively. Transfeminine people may also opt for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">face feminisation surgery</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Detransitioning</strong> is when someone who previously transitioned socially or medically goes back to living as their assigned gender at birth. Contrary to stereotypes, this is rarely out of regret for the transition itself (indeed, Gender Confirmation Surgeries have lower rates of regret than surgeries treating serious medical issues). It is most commonly due to the person in question feeling that the discrimination they suffer for being openly trans outweighs the relief of being able to live as their actual gender (a fair majority of detransitioners do so to regain access to children a former partner has custody of). It can also be conflated with someone who questions their gender identity (and might try a different name and pronouns for a while), but concludes they are cisgender without making any significant changes in their life. Either way, most professionals in the field report low rates of detransition (less than 1%), but this doesn't stop it being frequently brought up by anti-trans organisations (and tabloids looking for a quick buck).

</li><li> <strong>Stealth</strong> refers to a transgender person who passes well living as a cisgender person and not disclosing their trans status (not to be confused with a trans person living as their assigned at birth gender, which is simply being closeted). In the latter parts of the 20th century, this was expected of anyone who wanted to medically transition (or at least anyone who went along with medical gatekeeping). In more accepting times, this is less the case, but even today can be necessary for survival, or simply to avoid discrimination. Whether it's better to be "out and proud" (where it's safe to do so), or being seen as a member of your gender without any complications (aside from the risk of being forcefully outed) is a matter of some debate. It should go without saying that doing this or not is a personal choice, and outing a trans person is never acceptable.

<p>Portrayals of trans people range between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAcceptableTargets">Once Acceptable Targets</a>. While many portrayals are sympathetic, many, <em>many</em> are also built around jokes about the character "really" being another gender &mdash; plus, bigoted and inaccurate "trans panic" jokes portraying trans people as deceptive cross-dressers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">("Oh no, the hot chick is really a man!")</a> are still common. Because this line of reasoning is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_panic">often a motive<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Gwen_Araujo">for murder<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this type of humor goes beyond mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>.
</p><p>Trans women are more common in media than trans men, whose existence is largely ignored by the mainstream despite statistically being equally common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Trans people who align with neither gender (broadly known as "nonbinary") recieve even less exposure (and are often portrayed as a stepping stone to being "fully" trans when they do). When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">shapeshift</a> causes characters to get transformed into another sex though, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfGenderBending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLawOfGenderBending">almost always male characters getting stuck with female bodies</a>. Rarely does a female character end up inhabiting a male body. This influences the perception of trans people, even though "sex change shapeshift" is 'not' being trans. It varies, how good - or how awful - trans implications are handled in such storylines.
</p><p>Stereotypes and caricatures of trans women in the media can range from heavily masculine-bodied people wearing unflattering budget dresses and wigs, to highly attractive and feminine women whom men fear. In live-action movies, trans people are almost always played by either a cis man or a cis woman, as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerCharacterQueerActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerCharacterQueerActor">actual trans actors</a>, which doesn't exactly do wonders for visibility - and provokes a damaging misconception that trans people should be expected to be able to look exactly like a cis member of their aligned gender (which most can't and many don't want to). It also builds barriers on real trans actors: They don't come first to a director's mind when casting a cis character and thus have difficulties in getting roles. You know, most movie characters are cis. You see the problem when they aren't even casted 'for trans characters'.
Sometimes, two different actors are used before and after the transition.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a>, which is a trope about characters changing to another sex through magic or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> may change the DNA, but if the audience even gets to know that it requires a certain storyline. Some plots allow a "now-biologically-male" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">now-biologically-female</a> person being able to conceive a child, further complicating things. Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasySexChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasySexChange">Easy Sex Change</a>; though it has at least a <em>pretense</em> of realism, it minimizes or ignores many physical, psychological, and/or social complications of transitioning. Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransEqualsGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransEqualsGay">Trans Equals Gay</a> for common misconceptions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity">Ambiguous Gender Identity</a> is a trope for characters who may or may not be transgender. As more and more writers consult (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriteWhatYouKnow">or are</a>) trans people, more and more stories feature a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturallyValidatedTransPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturallyValidatedTransPerson">Supernaturally Validated Trans Person</a>, whose gender identity is verified by some sort of scientific or magical phlebotinum.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">Transhumans</a>, though the process of medically transitioning is an example of real life Transhumanist modification, a fact that has not been lost on many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a> writers.

Apparently the opposite idea never even <em>occurred</em> to them, or was brought up by any other person until they met Baldar and Erlick. They're even oblivious to the physical differences of the sexes. Even by the end of the film, it's not really clear that either of them grasped it, and they both may still identify themselves as male.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyThem">They/Them</a></em>: The protagonist, Ash, is nonbinary.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bit">Bit</a></em>: Laurel is a trans woman. Oddly enough, the words trans and transgender aren't ever spoken in the film, but they're part of its description. All the vampires simply know at once somehow, so it never needs saying.

Unique was presented as trans from the start and was immensely popular with fans, who often felt she was underused during the fourth and fifth seasons. Beiste, on the other hand, was introduced as a cisgender woman in the second season who later came out as a trans man in the sixth. This wasn't nearly as well-received since Beiste was <em>already</em> popular with the genderqueer crowd for being a masculine cis/straight woman, and giving the message that just because she wasn't super-feminine didn't make her any less of a woman. As you can imagine, many viewers were upset by the revelation that Beiste secretly identified as a man all along.

The band's discography includes several songs addressing or centered around the difficulties of being transgender, the most obvious of which is entitled "Transgender Dysphoria Blues". Interestingly, their first song to address the idea of being transgender was "The Ocean", released 7 years before Laura would officially come out and start to transition- at the start of the second verse, she sings "and if I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman", and goes on to mention her mother would have named her Laura if she had been born female. No one really got the significance until later.

According to Bull, the Qunari term for transgender people is Aqun-Athlok and by their society are treated as whatever gender they recognize themselves as. He also states that any female that wishes to become warriors (traditionally a male role in Qunari society) and are skilled enough at it be treated as thus and sent to the military, though that's more a culture-specific thing.
</li><li> The Aqun-Athlok concept is a bit different to most transgender experiences, however, in that it is based on what role a person takes under the Qun; if someone is a warrior, for example, they are a man because only men can be warriors, regardless of a person's assigned gender at birth. This is why Sten is so confused by a female warden, because in his culture, women <em>literally cannot be warriors</em> while still being women &mdash; they would be accepted and treated fully as men, however. Iron Bull mentions having to do some mental gymnastics to deal with it; he privately counts Cassandra as a man or woman depending on if she's wearing armor, although he makes sure to use female pronouns and not be a dick about it.

A number of other transgender mutants who don't possess this trait find other ways to change their sex, whether through 'sticky' powers such as ectoplasm manifestation or PK shells (Beltane, Mega-Girl), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> (Delta Spike), or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a> (Scapegrace). Of course, those who are subject to <em>un</em>willing gender bending, such as Phase, Jobe Wilkins, or Hat Trick, in effect <em>become</em> transgender regarding their former sex.

Cab, Bob?" has a trio of friendly, funny transvestites (one being a pre-op trans woman) who befriend Bob on his taxi route, and their only negative attribute is the fact that they're implied to be crackwhores.

The episode doesn't even try to portray Auntie Momma (yes, that's the character's name), originally Uncle Kevin, in a positive light, portraying her as someone who "manipulates" straight men into loving her and being called a "guy pretending to be a woman." At least with <em>Family Guy</em> there was an attempt at sensitivity and understanding, however clumsy.

<ul><li> Quagmire's Navy war hero father, Dan, undergoes surgery to become Ida, much to Quagmire's chagrin. Having bungled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayAesop">Gay Aesop</a> in a previous episode, the writers tried to make the character sympathetic, but still trotted out the old jokes (including an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">Unsettling Gender Reveal</a>), and earned the ire of quite a few LGBT people. It didn't help that, when she <em>wasn't</em> acting stereotypical, Ida was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">Flat Character</a> at best. Seth MacFarlane then further infuriated the LGBT community by saying that he thought the character was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2010/5/seth-macfarlane-complete-idiot?page=0">"probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character that has ever been on television."<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Many took this to be proof that MacFarlane had never <em>seen</em> a transgender character on TV.

</li><li> A recurring minor character on the show is a male-to-female transgender <em>robot</em> called Hermaphrobot, whom Bender once tried to hit on before noticing her manbot-parts.

However, it's not known if this is the case or if Mary is short for Marian (which some males, including a famous actor, have as names).

Brunella Pommelhorst, the elementary PE teacher, was supposed to transition but she still appears as a woman in future episodes.
</li><li> In "Lisa's First Word" when discussing saving money Homer says Bart can sleep with them until he's 21 just like his cousin Frank. When Marge points out that he doesn't have a cousin named Frank he explains that he later became cousin Francine. Unfortunately, the context for this has it implied Frank became Francine because sleeping with his parents for so long warped his mind, and he ultimately joined a cult under the name "Mother Shabubu."
</li><li> In "The Otto Show":

</li><li> The Season 18 episode "The Cissy" has Cartman declaring himself transgender (all the while mispronouncing it as "Transginger") in order to gain access to the girl's bathroom and eventually his own private bathroom in school. In response, Wendy becomes "Wendyl" in order to point out Cartman's hypocrisy. The B-plot deals with the fact that Randy Marsh is secretly the singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lorde">Lorde</a>, initially using the guise of a woman for the same reason as Cartman. Unlike Cartman however, he eventually develops genuine identity issues.
</li><li> The Season 23 episode "Board Girls" tackles the issue of trans women in sports when a character named Heather Swanson, a recently transitioned trans woman, beats Strong Woman and many other women at a series of games. The episode frequently references how difficult it is to address transgender issues without upsetting people. However, the episode implies Heather is not actually a trans woman but one of Strong Woman's exes who is faking the identity to defeat women at sports, and also portrays her(?) as a hypermasculine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a> caricature, at one point giving her visible testicles.

Fusions involving the half-human and male-identified Steven however seem to be nonbinary and use neutral pronouns. Stevonnie, the fusion of Steven and his female friend Connie, is confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to use "they/them" pronouns. Smoky Quartz, Rainbow Quartz 2.0, and Sunstone, the fusions of Steven and the (presumably female) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet, respectively</span> are similar. Unlike other Steven fusions, Rainbow Quartz 2.0 uses both he/him and they/them pronouns while Sunstone uses she/her and they/them.

<ul><li> Alice is a trans woman, though it's played for laughs because she is very clearly masculine (which has lead to some controversy around the character and her implications). Also, clearly pre-operative given the always-noticeable bulge in her skirt, and (censored) depictions of her oversized genitalia. The Warden lusts after her and is initially unaware of this, though it appears he either forgets about seeing her genitalia at the end of season 2 (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a>) or doesn't mind it.
</li><li> Bruce is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart">the reverse of Alice</a> and portrayed as overweight and lisping, with an aggressive temper. His personality is delved into less than hers, though he constantly tries to challenge and one-up her in his appearances.

<ul><li> Jewelstar, a side-character in season 5, is a transgender man. Notably, his counterpart in the original series was a cis woman.
</li><li> Double Trouble (a largely toyline only character in the original series) is reimagined as a gender neutral shapeshifter who goes by they/them pronouns.
</li><li> The creators have also gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">on record</a> stating that they designed Perfuma as a transgender woman, but didn't think they could make it canon so they didn't push the issue (and by the time they realised trans rep would be on the table, had already cast a cisgender voice actress).
