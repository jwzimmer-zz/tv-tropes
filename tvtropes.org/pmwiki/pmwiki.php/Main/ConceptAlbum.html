<p></p><div class="indent"><em>Times were when the term "concept album" meant having to phone in sick to wade through some four hour long metaphysical prospectus on flying Nepalese goatherds performed by men in long capes.</em>
<div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Kevin Maidment</strong>, reviewing Saint Etienne's <em>Tales From Turnpike House</em> on Amazon.co.uk
</div></div><p>Some albums are just a random assortment of songs that are only linked by being recorded/written at around the same time. Other albums are arranged so that the songs flow together without sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> between tracks. Then we have the Concept Album, which goes even further than that. Similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Operas</a>, concept albums are albums unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative or lyrical. Most often, they are meticulously planned, with all songs contributing to a single overall theme or unified story; this plan or story is the concept. Given that the suggestion of something as vague as an overall mood often tags a work as being a concept album, the precise definition of the term is up for debate.

</p><p>In the world of musical theatre, there is a separate and distinct form of concept album known as the album musical, in which the performers are playing characters in a story, a type of recording which encompasses such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">rock operas</a> as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tommy">Tommy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Quadrophenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Quadrophenia">Quadrophenia</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> made a number of these over his career: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreakOut">Freak Out</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbsolutelyFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbsolutelyFree">Absolutely Free</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WereOnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WereOnlyInItForTheMoney">We're Only in It for the Money</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LumpyGravy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LumpyGravy">Lumpy Gravy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CruisinWithRubenAndTheJets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CruisinWithRubenAndTheJets">Cruising With Ruben And The Jets</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoHundredMotels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoHundredMotels">200 Motels</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappaMeetsTheMothersOfPrevention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappaMeetsTheMothersOfPrevention">Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CivilizationPhazeIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CivilizationPhazeIII">Civilization Phaze III</a></em>,...

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> are technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandToon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandToon">concept</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity">band</a>, but many of their music videos follow a narrative thread, such as rappers being kidnapped for experiments.
</li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> albums which aren't Volumes are concept albums, concentrated on exploring a specific topic, theme or group of characters from the series. Perhaps the straightest example is M.G. Bowman's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido">Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, themed around the origin and purpose of Sburb and presented as a series of cryptic clues to its true nature, yet not a specific tie-in to any group of characters in particular.
</li><li> Most of The Hold Steady's albums also feature the same characters and themes, so they can be considered a Concept Band (in the same vein as Craig Finn's previous band, Lifter Puller).
</li><li> Neal Morse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Prog Rock</a> groups, Spock's Beard and Transatlantic. After converting to Christianity, Morse produced the Christian themed concept album, <em>Snow</em>, with Spock's Beard, after which he focused on a solo career focused on his new found faith, often deviating from his prog rock roots, though he has produced several prog rock Christian concept albums, including <em>?</em> about the tabernacle and <em>Sola Scriptur</em> about Martin Luther.
</li><li> Right Away, Great Captain! is essentially a concept band by Manchester Orchestra lead singer Andy Hull.
<ul><li> The first album, <em>The Bitter End</em> tells the story of a man finding his wife sleeping with his brother, so he leaves his children behind to go live as a sailor for three years, where he befriends his Captain, and the two talk about the existence of love.
</li><li> The second album, <em>The Eventually Home</em> tells of the man, now the Captain of the ship after the death of the Captain from the first CD, returning home to either forgive or murder his wife and brother. At the end of the album, he is still unsure what he wants to do.
</li><li> The story is expected to be resolved by the planned third album.
</li></ul></li><li> Every release from Pain Of Salvation is a concept album.
</li><li> Many of the albums from the intergalactic metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GWAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GWAR">GWAR</a> are concept albums. Almost every album has an accompanying DVD, which is either a concert, or a movie that more details the album's plot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProtomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProtomen">The Protomen</a> more or less exist to make their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Opera</a> concept albums. Yes, you read that right.
<ul><li> On that note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMegas">The Megas</a> are much of the same, except their music and concepts are more faithful to the original Mega Man games.
<ul><li> <em>The Belmonts</em> is the exception, an EP released on a blood-red cassette, it draws on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> mythos instead, with an odd bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> around it involving a mysterious demo tape with a note reading only "Release me," and an unknown band who seem to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarSquad">Similar Squad</a> to the Megas... Or perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">something less coincidental</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RhapsodyOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RhapsodyOfFire">Rhapsody of Fire</a> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> (almost literally) with their <em>ten-part</em> (as in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">ten sequential albums</a>) epic "Symphony of the Enchanted Lands" (itself split into two five-album sagas), telling a Tolkien-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> tale which is sometimes narrated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a>. And it is <strong>awesome</strong>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Epica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Epica">Epica</a> base most of their albums upon themes and concepts. Usually abstract and existential or based in myth and religious ideals.
</li><li> Not only is every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CoheedAndCambria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CoheedAndCambria">Coheed and Cambria</a> album a concept album, but every album ties in to a single story, called the Amory Wars, which the lead singer has adapted into a comic book series.
</li><li> Most albums by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool">tool</a> tend to fall under this classification. The themes presented in the albums are also further represented with visual motifs in the music videos and album art. Whether they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrewdriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrewdriver">clarify or confuse</a> those themes depends on the listener and the listener's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">level of sobriety</a> at the time though.
</li><li> Every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoundHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoundHorizon">Sound Horizon</a> album. Each and every one of them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Haken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Haken">Haken</a> has done this to an extent on every album. <em>Aquarius</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Opera</a> about a fisherman who finds a mermaid and sells her to the circus, <em>Visions</em> is about a man who sees his own death and his haunted by it, and <em>The Mountain</em> isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Opera</a>, but has some interwoven themes about pride, hubris, and giving insignificant things significance (as well as some repeated musical concepts).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devo">Devo</a> as a band are a concept in itself. Almost every piece of media that they produce - music, live shows, video, stage characters, merchandise, video game (<em>Adventures of the Smart Patrol</em>), book (<em>My Struggle</em>), and even various commercial spots - have some sort of social commentary or subversion to their unifying concept of "de-evolution".
</li><li> Every one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gackt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gackt">Gackt</a>'s non-compilation albums, as well as singles. Even his concerts are designed to be visual interpretations of his albums and singles, if not a continuation of their story.
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Minutemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Minutemen">Mike Watt</a>'s solo albums, so far. His first, <em>Ball-Hog Or Tugboat</em>, is notably the only one where the "concept" is purely musical, with no real running theme in the lyrics - the album is meant to be based around collaboration, with a different lineup of musicians appearing on every song and most of the lead vocals being performed by someone other than Watt.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InsaneClownPosse">Insane Clown Posse</a> have spent the better part of their career doing a concept album <em>cycle</em> - the Dark Carnival. The concept was that the six Joker's Cards were harbingers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, to be revealed one by one. The last two albums, <em>The Wraith</em> and <em>Hell's Pit</em>, were based around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> respectively. They returned to this concept in 2009, with <em>Bang! Pow! Boom!</em>, about a continuous explosion which cleanses evil souls from the carnival grounds, and the first of a series of new Joker's Cards.
</li><li> A <em>lot</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a>'s records are in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Albums</a>. Their titles are usually puns relating to the theme of the album.
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Avantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Avantasia">Avantasia</a>'s albums are this.
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ayreon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ayreon">Ayreon</a>'s albums are concept albums with several different singers, and they all tell different parts of the same weird sci-fi/fantasy story.
</li><li> <em>All</em> of <em>M&auml;go de Oz</em> albums with the exception of <em>Belfast</em> and <em>La Bruja</em> qualify.
<ul><li> The album <em>Finisterra</em> tells the story of a technologically-dependent future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopia</a>. <em>Gaia</em> also qualifies.
</li></ul></li><li> Other than the very earliest of their work, just about everything that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a> have ever written is thematically close enough that you might even call it a concept <em>career</em>.
</li><li> All of Classical-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSongs">Christmas</a>/Rock fusion group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransSiberianOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransSiberianOrchestra">Trans-Siberian Orchestra</a>'s albums are concept albums, as they all have a story built into them. the narrations can be found in the liner notes for each album. this makes their concerts VERY entertaining, as they go through the story, complete with narration, accompanied by some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBallsOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBallsOfFire">best light shows known to mankind.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAlanParsonsProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAlanParsonsProject">The Alan Parsons Project</a> lived and breathed this trope; nearly all of their albums were concept albums. They explored a wide range of concepts:
<ul><li> Musical adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s works (<em>Tales of Mystery and Imagination</em>).
</li><li> The effect of robots and technology on human culture (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IRobot">I, Robot</a></em>); pyramid power &amp; Egyptian mysticism (interest in which was widespread in the US and UK in the 1970s) (<em>Pyramid</em>).
</li><li> Relationships between women and men (<em>Eve</em>).
</li><li> Gambling and risk-taking (<em>Turn of a Friendly Card</em>), the public perception of industrial &amp; scientific developments (<em>Ammonia Avenue</em>); the worship of money and celebrity (<em>Vulture Culture</em>); the pressures of fame and the ways in which famous people are shaped by them (<em>Stereotomy</em>).
</li><li> The works of architect Antonio Gaudi (<em>Gaudi</em>).
</li><li> <em>Eye in the Sky</em> was originally not intended to be a concept album, as such. Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, in reaction to criticism that the whole idea of "concept albums" was becoming stale and cliche, began work on the album with the idea that they would simply write a bunch of songs, make an album, and <em>then</em> decide what (if anything) it was about. Despite that, the album ended up being a loose exploration of the influences of religious and political belief systems.
</li><li> And their solo works after the band's break-up:
<ul><li> Alan Parson's <em>On Air</em>, about aeronautics.
</li><li> Eric Woolfson's <em>Freudiana</em>, about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SigmundFreud">Sigmund Freud</a>, and two more albums about Poe.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Pick an album by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a>. They've released over 100, and chances are that the one you pick is a concept album. Some of their most popular examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCommercialAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCommercialAlbum">The Commercial Album</a></em> (one-minute pop songs), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eskimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eskimo">Eskimo</a></em> (documenting the lives of Polar Eskimos, and told almost entirely through grunting and wind noises), <em>God in Three Persons</em> (a cowboy exploits Siamese twins as faith healers), <em>The King and Eye</em> (bringing new meanings to classic Elvis songs) &mdash; also an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheMeaning">The Cover Changes the Meaning</a>, and <em>Wormwood</em> (retelling some of the Bible's more disturbing stories).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThirdReichAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThirdReichAndRoll">The Third Reich 'n Roll</a></em> is a concept album about a conspiracy theory that the Nazis wrote 1950s and 1960s rock and roll songs to corrupt the youth. In reality its an excuse to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum">Cover Album</a>.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCommercialAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCommercialAlbum">The Commercial Album</a>" might be the most rigorously-excuted concept album ever. Not only did they record 40 "pop" songs, each exactly a minute in length, but also bought up 40 one minute add spaces on San Francisco radio, effectively creating their own payola Top 40!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnZorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnZorn">John Zorn</a> has recorded many concept albums that pay tribute to a particular artist, including his famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Spillane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Spillane">Spillane</a></em>, a homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeySpillane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MickeySpillane">Mickey Spillane</a>, most famous for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MikeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MikeHammer">Mike Hammer</a></em> novels.
</li><li> <em>Erdenstern</em> is a German group producing 'music for your head cnema' - sound tracks usable in role-playing games. Each album by Erdenstern followes a certain theme, such as seafaring (Into the Blue), cold and ice (Into the White) or high-tech SF (Into the Grrey). The sepatrate tracks are seamlessly loopable, but just having them sorfted by themes is very useful.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloryHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GloryHammer">Glory Hammer</a>:
<ul><li> Their debut album is titled <em>Tales from the Kingdom of Fife</em>. The contents of the album is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> story about the fall of Dundee (to an army of undead unicorns), Angus Mcfife's quest for revenge and ultimately reconquering Dundee. All songs come in chronological order, and listening to the album in any other order than that pretty much ruins it all.
</li><li> Their second album is called <em>Space 1992: Rise of The Chaos Wizards</em>. This album is set ten centuries later in 1992, where the fantasy setting has developed into a space setting similar to<em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. This is about Zargothrax being released from his prison by the Chaos Wizards, and the events that ensue. As with the first album, listening to it in any order other than chronological ruins it.
</li><li> The third album is titled <em>Tales from Beyond the Galactic Terrorvortex</em>. It's set in the alternate universe that Angus and Zargothrax end up in after going through a wormhole created by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a> at the end of the previous album.
</li></ul></li><li> Over half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SufjanStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SufjanStevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>'s discography is concept music. <em>Enjoy Your Rabbit</em> is electronic music based on the Eastern Zodiac. <em>Michigan</em> is all songs inspired by that state; similarly, <em>Illinois</em> and its outtake album <em>The Avalanche</em> were inspired by Illinois. <em>The BQE</em> is the soundtrack to a film he made about the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. <em>Carrie and Lowell</em> is music he wrote to come to terms with his mother's death. Sufjan made such a reputation for writing concept albums that his own record label advertised his <em>The Age of Adz</em> by emphasizing that Sufjan had finally made an album that <em>had no concept</em>. (Ironically, the lyrics of that one lend themselves really well to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wanking</a> a concept anyway.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cormorant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cormorant">Cormorant</a> usually connects each song with a common theme for their albums, with <em>Metazoa</em> (animals), <em>Dwellings</em> (immortality) and <em>Earth Diver</em> (conspiracy and deceit).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae">Janelle Mon&aacute;e</a>'s solo records <em>Metropolis: Suite I - The Chase</em> (2007), <em>The ArchAndroid: Suites II and III</em> (2010), and <em>The Electric Lady: Suites IV and V</em> (2013) tell the ongoing tale of Cindi Mayweather, a messianic android from the year 2719 hunted by the Metropolis government for falling in love with the human Sir Anthony Greendown. The final chapters of Suites VI and VII (unless the story continues<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05dd5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note05dd5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05dd5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In interviews (and on the cover of <em>The ArchAndroid</em>), Mon&aacute;e said that the next album would be Suite IV. <em>The Electric Lady</em> covers Suites IV <em>and</em> V, and the cover art implies that there will be Suites VI and VII and that will be the end, but there's no knowing if that will change.</span>) will likely be covered in future albums. <em>Dirty Computer</em> is also a concept album, but it is not related to the Cindi Mayweather storyline.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth">Iced Earth</a>, over their long career, have produced more concept albums than not, to the point that it'd actually be easier to list the albums that <em>aren't</em> concept albums.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18btu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18btu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18btu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Iced Earth</em>, <em>Burnt Offerings</em>, <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>, and half of <em>Plagues of Babylon</em></span>
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOfEfrafa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOfEfrafa">Fall of Efrafa</a>'s music is based on their take on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em> and its sequel. They disbanded after they had finished telling the story they wanted to tell.
</li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigBigTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigBigTrain">Big Big Train</a> releases are concept albums, or have a unifying theme: <em>The Underfall Yard</em> is about the history's great builders and engineers; <em>Folklore</em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>.
</li><li> Swedish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerMetal">Power Metal</a> group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sabaton">Sabaton</a> are known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHistoryMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHistoryMetal">Horrible History Metal</a> about warfare and heroism.
<ul><li> In a case where the concept album became the concept for the <em>band</em>, <em>Primo Victoria</em>. Their earlier EPs and actual first album <em>Metalizer</em> were more standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> on varied topics, but were sent into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> by their first label. Then their second label actually let them release an album, which happened to be themed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHistoryMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHistoryMetal">Horrible History Metal</a> about war (mainly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> &mdash; the title track is about D-Day &mdash; and the two Iraq Wars, also including a song each about the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SixDayWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SixDayWar">Six Day War</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>). War songs have comprised the lion's share of the band's output ever since.
</li><li> <em>The Art of War</em> has one song for each of the thirteen chapters of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SunTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SunTzu">Sun Tzu</a>'s magnum opus on military science, quoting from it directly on several songs.
</li><li> <em>Carolus Rex</em> is about the rise and fall of the Swedish Empire in the 17th century, starting with the ascension to the throne of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NotableSwedishMonarchs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NotableSwedishMonarchs">Gustav II Adolf</a> (a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Gustavus Adolphus</a>), and ending with the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CarolusRex">Charles XII</a> and the Carolean Death March.
</li><li> <em>Heroes</em> is themed after specific war heroes, mainly lesser-known ones such as Franz Stigler<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2563t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2563t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2563t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a Luftwaffe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> who escorted a damaged B-17 to safety rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoupDeGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoupDeGrace">finishing it off</a>, and then became close friends with its pilot 40 years after the war</span> and Witold Pilecki<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3n7g0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3n7g0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3n7g0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a Polish Resistance leader who infiltrated Auschwitz to lead an uprising, but was later executed by the postwar pro-Soviet government due to his loyalty to the prewar regime</span>.
</li><li> <em>The Last Stand</em> is about, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">last stands</a>, some of which the side <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">holding the line</a> actually won. These range from the Battle of Thermopylae (with multiple references to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>) to the Battle of Vienna (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">"THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED!"</a>) to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_Castle_Itter">"strangest battle of World War II"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> where a couple dozen POWs, German defectors, American soldiers, and a tank held off a 200-man Waffen SS death squad until reinforcements arrived.
</li><li> <em>The Great War</em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, its battles and the extraordinary men who fought in it, such as Manfred von Richthofen the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RedBaron/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RedBaron/RealLife">The Red Baron</a>" and Francis Pegahmagabow who was the most successful sniper of the war.
</li></ul></li><li> Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling were themed around <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner</a></em>, as all their original songs were written about and named after a specific episode of the series: The songs were released in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a> over the course of multiple singles and EPs, and once they had a song for every episode of the show, they compiled them into a full album re-organized in the same order of the episodes, then dissolved the project.
</li><li> All of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Panopticon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Panopticon">Panopticon</a>'s full-length albums except the first one are concept albums; many are explained by their titles. <em>Collapse</em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the collapse of society</a>. <em>...On the Subject of Mortality</em> is about death and religion. <em>Social Disservices</em> is about the abuses in the foster care system. <em>Kentucky</em> is essentially a history of the labour activism associated with coal mining in the eponymous state. <em>Roads to the North</em> and <em>Autumn Eternal</em> are tough, because sole band member Austin Lunn hasn't released the lyrics, and they're largely indecipherable due to the vocal style, but they evidently form a trilogy with <em>Kentucky</em>. (The liner notes do explain some of the concept, but Lunn feels the lyrics are too personal to release.) <em>The Scars of Man on the Once Nameless Wilderness</em> relates to man's impact on the environment and the difficulty of finding genuine silence in the modern era.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43vqo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note43vqo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43vqo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The lyrics for this album actually weren't released either, but all eighteen songs have explanatory text explaining their concepts, and since the lyrics to the second half are entirely sung or spoken rather than screamed, most of them are easier to decipher.</span> More information can be found on the band's page.
</li><li> Every album by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Isis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Isis">Isis</a> is a concept album, and most of them explicitly relate to one another in some fashion, though few of them have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Opera</a>-style narratives per se. Details can be found on the band's page.
</li><li> Planet P Project by Tony Carey, keyboarder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a>, was made by him for his SF stuff. The self-titled first album is probably no concept album in itself (rather it's all the surplus he couldn't use with the band).
</li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOhHellos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheOhHellos">The Oh Hellos</a>' discography comes in this form:
<ul><li> <em>Through the Deep, Dark Valley</em> is told from the perspective of a single character, chronicling their early life, fall from grace, and later redemption. <em>Dear Wormwood</em> continues the story of that same character, now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a> writing messages to their beloved depicting how their relationship fell apart and their efforts to pick up the pieces and move on.
</li><li> Their follow-up is a four-part series named after Greek mythology's "four winds" and themed after their respective seasons&mdash; <em>Notos</em> (summer), <em>Eurus</em> (autumn), <em>Boreas</em> (winter), <em>Zephyrus</em> (spring) &mdash;centered around a common theme of change, renewal, and personal growth.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grimes">Grimes</a>' <em>Miss Anthropocene</em> has a loosely connecting thread of mankind's relationship to technology mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasLament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasLament">Gaia's Lament</a> in the form of an "anthropomorphic goddess of climate change", particularly from the track "Violence", which imagines the Earth's relationship to humanity as a mutually abusive romantic relationship through natural disasters and pollution respectively.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a>' released the instrumental albums <em>Ghosts V: Together</em> and <em>Ghosts VI: Locusts</em> on the same day in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are sort of twin albums. <em>Together</em> is described as being for "when things seem like it might all be okay" and is the more hopeful of the two, while <em>Locusts</em> is more bleak. Even the covers reflect this, with <em>Together</em> being light gray and <em>Locusts</em> being black.

<ul><li> Most of the albums <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Clipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Clipping">clipping.</a> have released are concept albums:
<ul><li> CLPPNG focus on telling stories from a third person perspective (there' no "i" in the album, get it?).
</li><li> Spledour and Misery is a slave song/gospel/hip hop space opera about an escaped slave being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">Sole Survivor</a> on the slave ship he's commandeered, fighting off lonliness and detection from the slavers.
</li><li> There Existed an Addiction to Blood is a horrorcore album with a 70's/80's horror movie aesthetic, each track preying on typical horror tropes (ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires being a metaphor for violent black revolution</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnuffFilm">snuff films</a>).
</li><li> The Wriggle EP is all about sex in some way, ranging from the hard-and-fast life of lower-class strippers off the title track, to meaningless, degrading sex to fill a void.

She makes it clear that the titular character "Electra Heart" is not an alter ego, but rather an exemplification of the dark sides of the American Dream.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RabbitJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RabbitJunk">Rabbit Junk</a> has two from the 2010s - <em>Project Nonagon</em> (2010) is a three-part album that tells three different stories about struggles for freedom, occult summonings, and cycling crime (<em>Nonagon</em>'s parts are all sequels to 2008's <em>This Life Is Where You Get Fucked</em>), featuring radically different musical styles in each. Meanwhile, <em>Rabbit Junk Will Die!</em> (2018) is a looser concept album themed around mortality and making the most of life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaretaker">The Caretaker</a>'s <em>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</em> is an album inspired by a study in which it was revealed that people with Alzheimer's disease are able to remember scenarios better when they heard music in those scenarios. The album is an ambient album made of pre-World War II vinyl recordings looped and spliced in order to give the listener the feeling of trying to recall memories while suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMountainGoats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMountainGoats">the Mountain Goats</a> released several concept albums in a row starting with 2009's <em>The Life of the World to Come</em>, themed after various Bible verses. They followed this with <em>All Eternal's Deck</em> in 2011 about a deck of tarot cards, and 2012's <em>Transcendental Youth</em>, about mental illness. Then in 2015 they made the album <em>Beat the Champ</em>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomethingCompletelyDifferent">for a change</a> was about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>.
</li><li> Given that one of their guitarists is nicknamed Kungen - Swedish for "(the) King" - Avatar's 2018 album <em>Avatar Country</em> decides to build upon it by creating the story of the titular nation-state. Led by a king - naturally played by Kungen in the music videos - Avatar Country is embroiled in a bitter war that, if scenes from the video to <em>The King Wants You</em> are to be believed, entirely stemmed from, of all things, a <em>disagreement on music tastes</em>. The King, angered by one of his courtiers suggesting that dubstep/EDM be used in place of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock">The Power of Rock</a>, sends the courtier into exile, where he's captured by Avatar Country's enemies and - in a colossal bit of backfiring - is made to switch sides, eventually becoming the leader of their military.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a> gets in on this with <em>A Thousand Suns</em>. It's basically about the fears of war. Naturally professional opinions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">fan opinions</a> are divided.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a>'s 2010 album <em>Mechanize</em> doesn't have a specific plot, you can hear the oppressive government lying to the regular people, a violent uprising against them, and the final collapse of the revolt and most of the track would fit into the <em>concept</em> albums easily.
</li><li> The Enid's <em>Journey's End</em> is about ecological threats and the possibility of space colonisation and <em>Invicta</em> concerns questions of religious faith and morality..
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay">Coldplay</a>'s <em>Mylo Xyloto</em>, which is a romance about the two titular protagonists, a boy and a girl, living and falling in love in a dystopian society.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetweenTheBuriedAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetweenTheBuriedAndMe">Between the Buried and Me</a>'s <em>The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues</em> and <em>The Parallax II: Future Sequence</em> make up two parts of a very confusing Concept Album. Even more confusingly, some of the band's songs going back as far as the band's second album <em>The Silent Circus</em> can be interpreted as relating to the concept in some way (at the very least, "Swim to the Moon" from <em>The Great Misdirect</em> explicitly relates to the <em>Parallax</em> storyline). Beyond that, <em>Automata</em> is a concept album about a company that steals people's dreams and sells them as entertainment, and <em>Coma Ecliptic</em> has a story about its central character's experiences while in a coma.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OFWGKTA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OFWGKTA">Tyler, the Creator</a>'s Bastard is all told to his school psychiatrist and deals with his personal issues like being a literal bastard.
<ul><li> This leads directly into Goblin, a sequel album about Tyler having another session with his Psychiatrist and dealing with new issues and the lifestyle that fame brings, eventually ending with him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaking down, killing the other members of Odd Future and realizing his psychiatrist and all his alter egos are a figment of his imagination.</span>
</li><li> Wolf acts as a prequel to both of these, involving a Summer Camp for Youths with mental issues named Camp Flog Gnaw run by the same Psychiatrist from Bastard and Goblin, and revolving around a psychopathic drug dealer named Sam, a new addition to the camp named Wolf, and a girl named Salem who acts as a love interest to both characters.
</li></ul></li><li> The latest album by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a>, <em>Hang Cool, Teddy Bear</em>, is narrated from the perspective of a soldier lying half-dead on a battlefield. The first track represents his thoughts at the moment, and each subsequent song presents a different possible scenario of his future.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Avantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Avantasia">Avantasia</a>'s <em>The Wicked Symphony</em> and <em>Angel of Babylon</em> continue "The Wicked Trilogy" begun by their 2008 album <em>The Scarecrow</em>. <em>The Mystery of Time</em> is a softspoken steampunk paranormal mystery.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a>'s <em>Femme Fatale</em> is about toxic relationships and clubbing and <em>Britney Jean</em> discusses a break up and recovering then finding love again.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChildishGambino">Childish Gambino</a>'s <em>Camp</em>, all of the songs on it work by themselves, but when listened to in order they tell an autobiographical story: his difficult childhood ("Outside"), his rise to fame ("Fire Fly"), the contrasting narcissism ("Bonfire") and self-loathing ("All the Shine") that accompany it, his difficulty having actual relationships now that he's successful ("Heartbeat," "L.E.S.," "Kids"), and finally facing his problems ("That Power"). Plus some epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoastfulRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoastfulRap">Boastful Rap</a> interludes here and there (which still relate thematically to the overall story).
<ul><li> His 2013 album <em>because the internet</em> centers around social media's role in tightening relationships between people, but not necessarily for the best reasons. The album came with its own <a class="urllink" href="http://becausetheinter.net/">screenplay<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that, if read at a steady pace, lines up with events heard in the audio.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cold187um" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cold187um">Cold 187um</a>'s album <em>The Only Solution</em> is an album-length story about an assassin who seeks revenge against his father's killer and performs assassinations for an unnamed company (implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PsychopathicRecords">Psychopathic Records</a>). It even comes with a comic book so you can follow the story.
</li><li> Color Theory's <em>Lucky Ago</em> is themed after superstitions on a track by track basis, except for the instrumental interlude "Lore":
<ul><li> "Shatterproof" - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheReflection">broken mirrors</a>

Despite the premise, it is not a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionRantSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionRantSong">Religion Rant Song</a>, but rather against the fanaticism generated by the religions rather than the religions themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nero">Nero</a>'s <em>Welcome Reality</em> takes place in December the first, 2808 and has a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourceSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourceSound">Source Sound</a> feel. Well, except for three songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple">Creator Couple</a> Michael J. Epstein and Sophia Cacciola have a pair of concept bands: As a duo, they're <em>Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling</em>, a band whose original songs are all inspired by specific episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner</a></em> (what happens when they run out of episodes is up in the air).
<ul><li> With the addition of Catherine Capozzi, they're <em>Darling Pet Munkee</em>, and write songs about old mail-order ads that were aimed at kids. An additional part of the DPM concept seems to be basing lyrics off the tone of the ad copy rather than the actual product - for instance "MONSTER S-I-Z-E MONSTERS" is about having an actual Frankenstein's Monster as a pet, when kids who actually ordered it were no doubt disappointed to discover it was just <a class="urllink" href="http://blog.michaeljepstein.com/2011/09/darling-pet-munkee-issue-4-monster-s-i.html">a large poster of the monster printed on garbage bag material<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> rather than any sort of realistic model.

</li><li> <em>Music Inspired by The Snow Goose</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Camel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Camel">Camel</a> consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">music inspired by the Paul Gallico novel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">The Snow Goose</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Covenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Covenant">Covenant</a>'s <em>Modern Ruin</em>. The songs are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadingIntoTheNextSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadingIntoTheNextSong">gaplessly crossfaded</a>, and the physical version (as opposed to the digital download) ends with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Hidden Track</a> "Modern Ruin Part II", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">mirroring the intro track</a>.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted by <em>Born This Way</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>. Many people thought the album had to do with religion due to the sheer amount of religious imagery in it, but she denies this. It also contains references to individuality and self-image.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deafheaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deafheaven">Deafheaven</a>'s <em>Sunbather</em> is another example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> concept album in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a>. The album is described as a concept album that "deals with the profound sadness found in the quest for one's personal perfection... serving as an artistic lucid dream of warmth despite the stinging pain of life's cruel idealism". Reading the lyrics, though, will still leave you stumped as to what they really mean.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hexode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hexode">Hexode</a> made a duo of EPs, <em>Sleep Sequence A&#153;</em> and <em>Sleep Sequence B&#153;</em> which are loosely based around the idea of falling asleep with the TV on.

The story is told from multiple perspectives, sometimes by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, and requires an in-depth read of the lyric sheet to achieve its full effect.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarsVolta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarsVolta">The Mars Volta</a>'s latest (possibly last, as the band is on indefinite hiatus) album <em>Noctourniquet</em> is also a concept album.
</li><li> The Sword's "Warp Riders" is a tribute to the sci-fi novels of the 1940-70's. The lyrics tell the story of an archer banished from his tribe, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousPrincess">princess</a> in a deep sleep on a distant planet, and a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">space pirates</a> called the Warp Riders. The singer and lead guitarist, who came up with the story, said it was just to give people something cool to think about while they listened to the album. A sort of "epilogue" song called Farstar was released as the B-side to the last track on the record, sending the Warp Riders off to a distant part of the galaxy with echo-y vocals and organs (As opposed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock">hard rock</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">heavy metal</a> sound of the rest of the album).

</li><li> The debut album of Neon Neon, <em>Stainless Style</em> was based on the life of John DeLorean. They followed it up with <em>Praxis Makes Perfect</em>, based on the life of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli.
<ul><li> Their earlier EP Four Ways To Scream Your Name is a concept EP about the various aspects of failed relationships, though that may be more to do with the generic nature of their lyrics at that point.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kamelot">Kamelot</a>'s album <em>Silverthorn</em> is based on a story about a little girl who dies at the hands of her twin brothers.

</li><li> Ian Anderson, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> fame, later made a sequel to the Jethro Tull <em>Thick as a Brick</em> which he released under his own name. It was, naturally, entitled <em>Thick as a Brick 2</em>. The lyrics focus on five potential scenarios which could have befallen the "author" of <em>Thick as a Brick</em>, Gerald Bostock; the end of the album <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">appears to show</a> all five possibilities, according to Wikipedia, "converg[ing] in a similar concluding moment of gloomy or pitiful solitude".
<ul><li> <em>Homo Erraticus</em> is supposedly written by Gerald Bostock, adapted from a manuscript he discovered. The manuscript was written in the early 20th century by Ernest T. Parritt, who, due to malarial fever, had delusions of past lives in history, as well as dark prophecies of the future.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KaizersOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KaizersOrchestra">Kaizers Orchestra</a>'s final trilogy of albums, <em>Violeta Violeta</em> vol. I-III, who were all written together and later split into three due to the sheer number of songs the writer was able to come up with for the theme. The albums tell the tale of the past, present and future of a young woman called Violeta who has mystical powers and a complicated and tragic family situation.

<ul><li> <em>Cytus Alive</em> is a collection of eleven songs from sta and Cranky that tell a story of humanity being wiped out by a virus and people going through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a> so they can continue to exist as robots, and reliving their human emotions by experiencing them in the form of the songs you play.
</li><li> <em>Knight</em> by Eyemedia, Hoskey, Nicode, and M2U is based on the splash screen for "Holy Knight", featuring two childhood friends, Iris and Rosabel. They are eventually separated, with Iris becoming a knight and Rosabel being forced to take the throne of a kingdom after her parents are killed and soon afterwards discovering a mysterious codex. Things...spiral into tragedy after that.

</li><li> <em>L</em>, composed by ICE and made into orchestral arrangements by gaQdan, is about an entity that threatens to destroy Heaven, only to find himself under the control of a boy in Heaven, soon taking over said boy and traveling down to the human realm. He then takes over the boy of a human boy, and the resulting efforts by the forces of Heaven end up triggering a catastrophic meteor shower that destroys the boy's hometown and everyone who inhabits it, including the human boy's parents.

</li></ul></li><li> Post-Hardcore band Defeater has made it a trend to make each album a concept album, all which <em>connect together as one story</em>: The story of a struggling family in New Jersey after World War II. The band's debut <em>Travels</em> focuses on the younger son of the family who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills his alcoholic father after an argument, resulting with him fleeing home and traveling around the country, only to returning home to find his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">older brother</a> waiting for him and to execute him due to his leaving causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">more suffering to their family</a></span>. This leads to a <em>heavy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, if you can say so.
<ul><li> The second concept album <em>Empty Days &amp; Sleepless Nights</em> is actually more of the same story as the first one, but through the perspective of the older brother, showing him more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssWoobie">Jerk Ass Woobie</a> and even showing how his life was during the time his brother left.
</li><li> <em>Letters Home</em> is also connected to the same family, being about the boys's father during his time in WWII.
</li><li> <em>Abandoned</em> also connects to this trope, being about <em>the priest</em> the boy speaks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> at the end of <em>Travels</em></span>, focusing on his own struggle.
</li><li> Implications now hit that the band's self titled album will focus on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the family's matriarch and her sinful role in their downfall</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MelanieMartinez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MelanieMartinez">Melanie Martinez</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CryBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CryBaby">Cry-Baby</a>" is about a woman who comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyMarriageCharade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyMarriageCharade">dysfunctional family</a>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her mother murders her father</span>, she falls for a boy but it's an unhealthy relationship and they break up. She falls for someone else but is uncomfortable with intimacy.

The former is focused on history and the treatment of heretics by the church. The latter is focused on apologetics more.
<ul><li> Pelagial is another concept album, originally written as an instrumental depicting diving deeper and deeper into the ocean. When vocals were added, it became a metaphor of exploring the self through some Freud-like themes.

</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HotChip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HotChip">Hot Chip</a>'s 2010 album <em>One Life Stand</em> is broadly about love, relationships, companionship and looking for someone to settle down with and accompany you through life, hence the title (often in some odd directions; <em>Thieves In The Night</em> is somewhat cryptic but appears to be about dating and casual sex, while <em>We Have Love</em> seems to be from the perspective of a couple who have (or had) nothing else keeping them together beyond some vague notion of love.)

The style of music also gradually shifts to reflect both changing technology and what Merritt's tastes were like at the time: The first few songs primarily feature acoustic instruments - electric guitars and early drum machines and synthesizers start appearing partway through the first disc of the album, and from there these elements start getting more prevalent.

</li><li> Rosal&iacute;a's second album, <em>El Mal Querer</em> (Spanish for <em>The Bad Loving</em>) tells the story of a woman trapped in an abusive relationship, and uses the various sounds characteristic of Flamenco Music to represent the different parts of the struggle (for example, the iconic claps are used to represent physical violence). It is also based on a 13th century novel titled <em>El roman de Flamenca</em>.

The band initially wanted to release three separate albums - titled <em>Jupiter</em>, <em>Mars</em>, and <em>Venus</em>, each with distinctive cover art - but decided instead to combine the first two and release the last one as a series of B-sides. The mood of the songs is mostly spacey and psychedelic, overlapping with the original celestial names of the albums.

Though unlike with <em>Leviathan</em>, none of this is anything you'd necessarily pick up on without reading band inteviews.
</li><li> And <em>Blood Mountain</em>, which is about climbing a mountain, and poop going crazy. If you think about it, every Mastodon album has been more insane than the last. Their debut, <em>Remission</em> isn't even a concept album.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>Hildegard von Bingen</em> is a Latin-language album with downtempo electronic influences based on the compositions of a 12th century nun. It was released by Garmarna, a folk-progressive rock band from Sweden. Yup.
</li><li> Pain of Salvation's <em>The Perfect Element I</em> is about two disturbed people who find love within each other, and it ends badly.
<ul><li> <em>Remedy Lane</em> is a story of a childhood romance that is reawakened, but then dismantled because of broken pasts, adultery, and suicide.
</li><li> <em>Be</em> describes a situation in which God becomes disappointed (to say the least) with his human creation and decides to "leave them to their own devices".
</li><li> <em>Scarsick</em> continues from "The Perfect Element I", except now, the protagonist watches TV and feels bad about stuff.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatrickWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PatrickWolf">Patrick Wolf</a> is particularly fond of the concept album. His first album, Lycanthropy, centers on his childhood and adolescence.
<ul><li> His second, <em>Wind in the Wires</em>, is focused on his Cornish and Gaelic roots.
</li><li> His third, <em>The Magic Position</em> is inspired by a relationship, and focuses on the theme of Love.
</li><li> <em>The Bachelor</em> is one half of two albums that serve as a commentary on depression, inspiration and love. The Bachelor focuses on the first two, and <em>Lupercalia</em> (2011) focused on the latter two.
</li><li> Even his singles have a tendency to wander into this trope, with both the "Tristan" and "Wind In The Wires" <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EPs">E Ps</a> featuring two B-Sides each that contribute to the Cornish/Gaelic feel of the aforementioned song's parent album (Although, rather thankfully, his latest batch of singles avoid this).

It's a three-part anthology of short concepts - <em>The Struggle</em> tells of three struggles for freedom from the 1940s to the present day, <em>Ghetto Blasphemer</em> tells of inner-city occult summonings and the havoc thus caused, and <em>This Death is Where You Get Life</em> tells of a city cyclist seeing revenge on the person who stole his bike. 2010's <em>Project Nonagon</em> continues each story.

<ul><li> <em>Tallahassee</em> follows from <em>Sweden</em>, focusing on a different fictional couple.
</li><li> <em>All Hail West Texas</em> is, as described by singer-songwriter John Darnielle, "Fourteen songs about seven people, two houses, a motorcycle, and a locked treatment facility for adolescent boys."
</li><li> <em>We Shall All Be Healed</em> is about the songwriter's years as a teenage meth addict.
</li><li> <em>The Sunset Tree</em> is about his physically abusive stepfather,
</li><li> <em>Get Lonely</em> is about, well, loneliness.
</li><li> <em>The Life of the World to Come</em> is "twelve hard lessons the Bible taught [Darnielle]".
</li></ul></li><li> Defeater's debut album, "Travels", tells the story of an unwanted child trying to make his way in the world.
<ul><li> They've since taken this farther. Their follow-up EP "Lost Ground" tells the story of the homeless man that is met midway through "Travels" (an African American WWII vet) and their latest CD "Empty Days&amp;/ Sleepless Nights" is the story of "Travels" from the older brother's point of view.
</li></ul></li><li> Virgin Steele's <em>The House of Atreus: Act I</em> and <em>The House of Atreus: Act II</em> retell the story of the Oresteia.

One could also fit <em>Midian</em> into this category, as the titular city is mentioned in every song, but the album lacks an overall story on the other hand.
</li><li> <em>INRI</em> by Psyclon Nine is all negative commentary on Christianity and the consequences of it.
</li><li> Saint Etienne's <em>Tales From Turnpike House</em> is a series of vignettes about a day in the life of the residents of a north London block of flats (which doesn't really narrow things down much, since nearly <em>all</em> of their music is about London in one way or another), including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a> Gary Stead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(who turns out to be Drowning His Sorrows)</span> and a couple played by Sarah Cracknell and David Essex arguing about leaving the city to go and live the good life.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a>'s <em>Oops! I Did It Again</em> is being yourself and loved as yourself, <em>Britney</em> is growing up and into your sexuality, <em>In The Zone</em> is sexuality and exploring it, <em>Blackout</em> is forgetting upsets and having a good time, <em>Circus</em> is a mix tape of a circus of sounds.
</li><li> <em>Addicted to Bad Ideas: Peter Lorre's Twentieth Century</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWorldInfernoFriendshipSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWorldInfernoFriendshipSociety">The World/Inferno Friendship Society</a> is a concept album about, well, the life and times of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre">Peter Lorre</a>. It follows him from being a starving actor in Weimar-era Berlin, to fleeing to Hollywood where he hopes to make it big while struggling with a morphine addiction. The band's performed it live as a semi-musical several times, and has announced that their next album will also be a concept album: a punk version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/APrairieHomeCompanion">A Prairie Home Companion</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Coldplay">Coldplay</a>'s <em>Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends</em>, which is thoroughly cohesive and even cyclical but gives each song individual power, part of the reason it's probably the most pop-culturally viable Concept Album in years (the other part being that, rather than an exact story, the album is basically about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism">the highs and lows of life</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">This coming from Coldplay of all bands</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">blew everyone's mind</a> and won them several Grammys.

<ul><li> In addition, some of the songs advance the storyline of "Michael Young History," who was the boy from <em>He Say, She Say</em> on his previous album, and later died and resurrected as "The Cool." The songs dealing with him show his rise and fall as a hustler, ending in betrayal and death.

It's all about war, pro and anti. Every song has something to do with conflict and rebellion. With such songs as "A Call to Arms" and "This is War", the meaning is clear. It makes sense when you realize the band fought a war of their own with the record industry in making this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NineInchNails">Nine Inch Nails</a> have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YearZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YearZero">Year Zero</a></em>, which was about a future American dystopia, accompanied by an extensive ARG.
<ul><li> <em>Broken</em>, whilst an EP rather than an album, is also a concept piece, specifically about Trent's experiences working with TVT Records. Yep; "Happiness In Slavery" is <em>not</em> about sadomasochism, despite the rather prominent usage of sadomasochistic imagery.
</li><li> Also, <em>Ghosts</em>. It's over two hours of purely instrumental music, using all sorts of odd sounds and beats.

Over the album he meets a girl, has encounters with gambling and taking drugs, argues with the girl, goes on holiday, finds out the girl is cheating on him and loses the girl before the album offers two possible endings where 1. the protagonist angrily shuns his friends and gets into a fight with a TV repairman, winding up angry and miserable or 2. reconciles with a friend, finds the money he lost and meets another girl with the suggestions of a future relationship, but acknowledging that you cant wholly rely on others in tough times when they have their own problems to deal with.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CamperVanBeethoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CamperVanBeethoven">Camper Van Beethoven</a>'s <em>New Roman Times</em> is set in an alternate universe present-day United States, which parallels the country's political divisions in real life: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica">The US has separated into two countries that are hostile to each other</a>, the Christian right-wing Texas and the left-wing utopian California.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge">Queens of the Stone Age</a>'s third album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsForTheDeaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsForTheDeaf">Songs for the Deaf</a></em>, is a concept album that shows their breaking into mainstream radio by using interludes before and after most of the songs that sound like the buzz of a station changing, along with a different DJ/radio personality talking before they play the song. One is completely in Spanish, as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SayAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SayAnything">Say Anything...</a>'s <em>...Is a Real Boy</em> was originally intended to be a rock opera, complete with spoken-word interludes between the songs explaining the story's progression. This knowledge of the album's backstory makes songs like "I Want to Know Your Plans" all the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">dimensional and profound</a>. Tragically, the speaking parts were cut from the final album though the story remains the same and is briefly explained in the liner notes of the album:
<div class="indent"> "The plot revolved around a moderately successful "indie/punk" rock band called Say Anything, fronted by 21-year-old Max Bemis, an idealistic, introverted singer/songwriter crippled by depression and anxiety and alienated by what he sees as a vast hypocrisy inherent in society. One night, a supernatural power "curses" Max with a mysterious affliction. The "curse" causes his innermost fears, fantasies, and thoughts to burst forth from his mouth at any given time in the form of fully arranged rock anthems. Max simply cannot control it: any time he feels a strong emotion, everything around him becomes a bizarre musical. Though Max's new powers at first seem only to frighten people, they soon cause the opposite effect as Say Anything becomes an accidental phenomenon. The blatant honesty of the lyrics as well as the freak-show appeal of a man physically unable to censor himself strike a powerful chord amongst the underground culture that one dismissed Max's music as "unsubstantial". Now, worshipped by rock-and-roll America as a Christ-like figure, Bemis sets out to use his powers to vanquish all hypocrisy. The proposed rock opera planned to chronicle Bemis' rise to power as well as his undoing by the fundamental flaw in the logic of every self-involved, impassioned rock singer. Whether capitalist America is "the enemy" or not, there is greed, duplicity and hatred in every human being, especially in the greatest hypocrites of all: the "entertainers" among us, whose need for attention fosters a sick dream that they alone hold the key to mankind's salvation. In the end, Max is left to fight "the man" with the corniest song he's ever written and the knowledge that accepting love and salvation lies within admitting he is nothing more or less than a human being."
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzFerdinand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzFerdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a> tried their hand at this trope with <em>Tonight: Franz Ferdinand</em> (which was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">New Sound Album</a>, but that's besides the point). Unlike most of the rest of the albums on the list, the concept is rather mundane (and ends up succeeding for it): it's about a drunk, debauched night on the town (most likely Glasgow).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnFrusciante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnFrusciante">John Frusciante</a>'s third album, <em>To Record Only Water for Ten Days</em>, refers to the ten separate times during which he conceived the album and wrote all the songs for it. During the writing process, he claims that he envisioned his body as a tape recorder, with the water of music and life rejuvenating and cleansing him, and that imagery propelled the entire album.
<ul><li> His tenth album, <em>The Empyrean</em>, is about the collision of ancient and modern ideas of spirituality and how it is relevant to our daily lives.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcadeFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArcadeFire">Arcade Fire</a>'s first three albums qualify:
<ul><li> <em>Funeral</em> is about aging, loss, and community.
</li><li> <em>Neon Bible</em> is about religion/the apocalypse, with television and the ocean somehow recurring.
</li><li> Anyone who needs the subject of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSuburbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSuburbs">The Suburbs</a></em> explained deserves to be shot for literally incredible thickness (although in a somewhat unique twist, the album is not some kind of meditation on the subject from the outside but rather a "letter <em>from</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Suburbia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Suburbia">suburbia</a>," reflecting Win Butler's youth in that ultimate suburb&mdash;The Woodlands, Texas).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FuneralForAFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FuneralForAFriend">Funeral for a Friend</a>'s <em>Tales Don't Tell Themselves</em> is a concept album about a guy called David who goes out in a boat and gets into trouble, being away from his family for several months with no means of contacting them. The lyrics take place from both his perspective, and that of his wife and young son who don't know what is going on. In an unusual move for a concept album the story isn't told in the correct order, rather it is chosen for flow. However, the sequence featuring "All Hands On Deck Pt 1: Raise The Sail", "All Hands On Deck Pt II: Open Water", and "Out Of Reach" is clearly in order and "Into Oblivion (Reunion)" is obviously the last part despite being the first track.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarsVolta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMarsVolta">The Mars Volta</a>'s album <em>De-Loused in the Comatorium</em> follows a young man overdosing on morphine and rat poison, enduring a week-long coma in which he sees vivid visions of mankind and his own psyche, and finally, committing suicide. The story itself is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as it's based on the life and death of Julio Venegas, a close friend of Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala. Their second album, <em>Francis the Mute</em>, is also a concept album.
<ul><li> And of course, there's <em>The Bedlam in Goliath,</em> about the band's experiences with a ouija board.
</li></ul></li><li> Local H's <em>12 Angry Months</em> describes one year of emotions surrounding a breakup, including anger, sadness and moving on.
</li><li> Porcupine Tree's <em>Deadwing</em> is apparently a concept album, but what that concept actually <em>is</em> is something Steven Wilson is keeping to himself for now. He's apparently working on a film for it.
<ul><li> In Absentia is more definitely a concept album, about serial killers.
</li><li> Additionally, "Lightbulb Sun" is a horridly depressing (and presumably autobiographical on Wilson's part) story about relationships dissolving as time passes.
</li><li> <em>Fear Of A Blank Planet</em> and <em>The Incident</em> also focus on specific themes and stories.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos">Tori Amos</a> has created several concept albums, including <em>Scarlet's Walk</em> (the tale of a woman's trek across the country) and <em>Strange Little Girls</em> (a collection of covers of songs originally performed by men, redone from a woman's perspective).
</li><li> Sixx:A.M.'s album <em>The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the soundtrack</a> to Nikki Sixx book "The Heroin Diaries". Each song represents a chapter in the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hospice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Hospice">Hospice</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAntlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAntlers">The Antlers</a> tells the utterly soul crushing tale of the doomed relationship between the narrator, a hospital worker, and the deeply troubled patient for whom he works as a home visitor. Suffice to say, things don't go well. An extraordinarily harrowing album about despair, pain and hopelessness, but through it all, love.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson">Richard Thompson</a>'s <em>1000 years of popular music</em> is an unusual take on the concept album, as he didn't write any of the songs. Instead, it's a history of popular music starting in the 11th century and ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallingUp">Falling Up</a>'s album <em>Fangs!</em> tells the story of a man who journeys to another planet to investigate an attack on his home world. The prologue of the story is given in the liner material, but the actual story is...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">rather unclear</a>.
</li><li> Armor for Sleep's <em>What To Do When You Are Dead</em> is a concept album that starts with the protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emo">committing suicide by driving his car into a lake</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">because he has issues with his girlfriend.</a> The subsequent songs follow him as he, now a ghost, hangs around haunting said girlfriend and moping about how much it sucks to be dead before finally accepting his fate.
</li><li> The Thrice album "The Alchemy Index" was released in 2 parts of 2 volumes, and relates the 4 elements to music. Fire is the heavy album, water has a more electronic sound, air is light and the songs flow seamlessly, and earth is acoustic and bluesy.
</li><li> <em>Wincing the Night Away</em> by The Shins tells the story of a teenage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe">Nietzsche Wannabe</a> who falls asleep and enters an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>-like dream world where he falls in love with a girl, to whom he tells his philosophy, ruining her outlook on life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Life Lessons</a> ensue.
</li><li> Mayday Parade's <em>A Lesson in Romantics</em>, arguably.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cursive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cursive">Cursive</a> does this a lot.
<ul><li> 2000's <em>Domestica</em> was about the relationship between two characters named Sweetie and Pretty Baby. The album relates (almost directly) to events from lead singer Tim Kasher's divorce (though some concepts, like cheating, were added). The album ends rather ambiguously. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to Tim Kasher</a> the couple in the story end up staying together, despite all their differences and the fighting.
</li><li> 2003's <em>The Ugly Organ</em> tells the story of the lust, love, and empty sex throughout the "Ugly Organist's" life.
</li><li> 2006's <em>Happy Hollow</em> revolves around the titular small, upper class, God-fearing town, with each track telling a different story of faults that those living in Happy Hollow portray that seem at odds with the town's "perfect" image. The final track, "Hymns for the Heathen", is an afterword of the album.
</li><li> 2009's <em>Mama, I'm Swollen</em> depicts a middle-aged man full of failure and facing a hell of personal demons.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Showbread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Showbread">Showbread</a>'s <em>Anorexia</em> and <em>Nervosa</em> are about a pair of identical twin sisters who take very different paths in life. Anorexia works with the sick and eventually founds a hospital. Nervosa goes to work at a slaughter house and becomes a stripper. Both come to the same end.
</li><li> <em>Futureperfect</em> by VNV nation is about the death of optimistic/idealistic visions of the future's prospects.
</li><li> Project 86's <em>Truthless Heroes</em>.
</li><li> <em>Truth of the World: Welcome to the show</em> by Evermore, is about media, propaganda and advertising, with occasional interludes by a trash-news type show that shares it's name with the album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdgeOfSanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdgeOfSanity">Edge of Sanity</a>'s <em>Crimson II</em> continues the story of <em>Crimson</em> with the awakening of the tyrannical queen from the first album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarrenHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarrenHayes">Darren Hayes</a>' third album, <em>This Delicate Thing We've Made</em> is a double album exploring the concept of time travel.
</li><li> <em>Machina/The Machines of God</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>. Noted for its storyline being told through many outlets: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia">the album, its only-released-via-the-internet sequel, its artwork, the band's Web site and cryptic flyers handed out at concerts</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, their album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MellonCollieAndTheInfiniteSadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MellonCollieAndTheInfiniteSadness">Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</a></em> is a loose concept album about the cycle of life and death.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a> album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackParade">The Black Parade</a></em> is about a cancer patient who may or may not die at the end.
<ul><li> <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em> may also qualify.
</li><li> <em>I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love</em> is the twisty but understandable story of two lovers during a vampire invasion/attack.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">Dream Theater</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetropolisPt2ScenesFromAMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MetropolisPt2ScenesFromAMemory">Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory</a></em> follows the story of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nicholas and the discovery of his past life, which involves love, murder, and infidelity as Victoria Page.</span>
<ul><li> Interesting note: The "part one" in <em>Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper</em> was tacked on as a joke. Part two was originally a twenty-minute <em>song</em> which would later be developed further into <em>"Metropolis Pt. 2"</em>.
</li><li> <em>Octavarium</em> also sort of counts, as it revolves around musical concepts: The first track is called "The <strong>Root</strong> Of all Evil, each track is in a progressively higher key, with the 8th track, called <strong>Octav[e]</strong>arium, is the same key as the first but an octave higher, there are interludes where the flats and sharps would be, etc. In addition, the artwork of the album also revolves around these types of numerical themes. Read more about it <a class="urllink" href="http://dt.spatang.com/octavarium.php">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Chaos and Creation in the Backyard</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. Notable because this album was immediately recognized as a concept album, but it took over a year for Paul's fans to learn what the concept actually was.
</li><li> <em>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>.
</li><li> Duncan Sheik's <em>Whisper House</em> album is based around the concept of ghosts commenting (quite cynically) on the foibles and hardships of the living. It doesn't follow a strict narrative throughout, but a vaguely sketched cast of characters are introduced in the first song and followed up on in the final song.
</li><li> Shadow Gallery has a two-part (three planned) multi-disc epic with <em>Tyranny</em> and <em>Room V</em>. They detail a romance between two revolutionaries working to bring down a fascist government, but it turns out the female has peculiar strand of DNA which is vital to the operations of the system. Naturally, it's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a> as of now.
</li><li> Semi-fictional example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/Metalocalypse">Dethklok's</a> <em>Dethwater</em>. The entire album was written for sealife, and was recorded in the Marianas Trench. Features such songs as "Go Into the Water" and "Murmaider" ("It's about mermaid murder.")
</li><li> King Geedorah's <em>Take Me to Your Leader</em>. Rapper Daniel Dumile (MF DOOM) takes on the persona of space monster King Geedorah, and the album is told through his alien perspective on humans... who he ultimately wishes to enslave.
<ul><li> In fact, most of Dumile's work qualifies. His first album, <em>Operation: DOOMSDAY</em> (released in 1999), chronicled the story of DOOM, a young college student turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> after a scientific accident scarred his face (if that reminds you of anything, it's supposed to).
</li><li> His next venture focused on Viktor Vaughn, a typical otaku b-boy from Latveria with a knack for technology and an ego the size of Michigan who is flung back in time to 1993 by one of his experiments.
</li><li> In <em>Madvillainy</em>, DOOM reluctantly finds himself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Villain Team-Up</a> with miniature supergenius Madlib, while Viktor Vaughn swears revenge after DOOM steals his girl. DOOM's crime spree continues in <em>The Mouse and the Mask</em>, where he and his new partner, the deadly Danger Mouse, are sought by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a>.
</li><li> Judging from the fact that he adopts different personas for different albums, usually performs wearing a mask (or in shadow, with sunglasses, as Viktor Vaughn), and the fact that all of his characters have their own speech styles, mannerisms, and storylines, it's safe to say Daniel Dumile has a concept <em>career</em>. There's even a <em>rivalry</em> between two of his identities.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolvesInTheThroneRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolvesInTheThroneRoom">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> recorded a trilogy of concept albums from <em>Two Hunters</em> to <em>Celestial Lineage</em>, but especially given that the band haven't released lyrics from <em>Black Cascade</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">fans still aren't entirely clear on what the concept is</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queensryche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queensryche">Queensr&yuml;che</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OperationMindcrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OperationMindcrime">Operation: Mindcrime</a></em> tells the story of a somewhat-ethical mercenary who gets brainwashed by a charismatic terrorist leader into becoming an assassin.
<ul><li> This release is notable for being the first progressive metal album to meet mainstream success and for renewing the idea of the concept album in metal.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth">Iced Earth</a>'s <em>Horror Show</em> is about the monsters and characters from various classic horror movies; <em>The Glorious Burden</em> is about various historical wars and battles (with a second CD of <strike>three songs</strike> an extremely long song in three parts about the Battle of Gettysburg), and <em>Framing Armegeddon (Something Wicked Pt. 1)</em> which tells the story of a world conquered by evil invaders and their 10,000 year hidden struggle against them. <em>The Crucible of Man (Something Wicked Pt. 2)</em> is the sequel to the former album and was released in 2008.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsAndMadmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsAndMadmen">Poets and Madmen</a></em> by Music/Savatage has no narrative but is about an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonedHospital">Abandoned Hospital</a> and a famous photographer tormented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostHistoricalTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostHistoricalTrauma">Post-Historical Trauma</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a>'s Digimortal album is about a society which creates clones of people, and transfers their soul and memories into them to prolong life. Includes at least one song from one of the clones in question.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> released a trilogy of albums called the <em>Brutal Planet</em>/<em>Dragontown</em>/<em>Eyes Of Alice Cooper</em> trilogy (About life in a post-apocalyptic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>). He also released <em>Along Came A Spider</em> (About a serial killer who attempts to construct a spider out of the body parts of his victims) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FromTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FromTheInside">From the Inside</a></em> (Based on his stay in a New York sanitarium due to his alcoholism).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AkikoShikata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AkikoShikata">Akiko Shikata</a>'s <em>Harmonia</em> is built around the theme of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourElementEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourElementEnsemble">Four-Element Ensemble</a>: the wind part (track 1 to 4) focuses on the feelings of traveling and flying in the sky; the fire part (5 to 8) has tense songs with heavy electric instrumentations and dark lyrics; the water part (9 to 12) contrasts it with soothing songs and light instrumentations; the earth part (13 to 15) has a "tribal dance" feel to it. Each part is introduced by a short interlude titled "Chouwa ~ something", all four of which form the first verse of <em>Chouwa ~ Harmonia</em>, the penultimate track. <em>Harmonia ~ Mihatenu Chi he</em> brings all this together in a joyful conclusion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PeterGabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>'s 2002 album <em>Up</em> deals with themes of birth and death (mostly death).
</li><li> The album <em>Nigredo</em> by Diary Of Dreams (a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarkWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DarkWave">Dark Wave</a> band from Germany) is a concept album with a story. It's about a person who discovers that he's actually a being called K'tharsia, who is also the fifth element necessary to create a deadly virus, the titular Nigredo, that would destroy most of humanity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">At the end, he unites with the other four elements, leading to the plague outbreak</a></span>. One of the following albums, <em>Nekrolog 43</em>, seems to take place into the world after the events of Nigredo. Not that you would know any of that without reading the booklets. Or even after that.
</li><li> The Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein released their album <em>A Shipwreck in the Sand</em> in 2009, which follows an unnamed character who finds out his wife has been cheating on him with his best friend. The man then burns his wife's house down out of spite while she and their six-year-old daughter are inside, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">upon realizing that he still loves them</a>, he rushes into the burning building to save them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The wife presses charges against her husband, and wins custody of their daughter in prison. However, with lack of evidence to support that the husband had indeed burned the house down, the husband is released until the next day.

For information, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">Face of the Band</a> Toby Driver has stated that there is a puzzle buried in the music, lyrics, and packaging to the two albums. "The Secret Song", a subsequent release by the band, was intended to help unlock the puzzle. This was in 2001. As of 2019, no one has successfully figured it out.
</li><li> Karnivool's <em>Sound Awake</em> seems to have a clear emotional arc to its lyrics and several songs refer to similar concepts and phrases, so it has been interpreted as a concept album about its protagonist coming to grips with the hypocrisies and injustices in society, along with the emotional struggles inherent in doing so. The band has explained a couple of the songs, explicitly saying that the lead-off single "Set Fire to the Hive" is a "sonic call to arms" designed to remind listeners that living in a democracy gives them specific rights, and to challenge them to examine how much control they actually have over society and their own lives. Many of the other songs can be interpreted in a similar fashion.
</li><li> <em>Eternal Kingdom</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CultOfLuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CultOfLuna">Cult of Luna</a> has a fantasy narrative with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">Direct Line to the Author</a> claiming it was the diary of a mental patient institutionalised for murdering his family. This was later revealed by the band to be a hoax <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">at the expense of music journalists</a>. <em>Somewhere Along the Highway</em> is a concept album, too, challenging traditional gender roles and deconstructing many of the tropes inherent in society's assumption that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTough">Men Are Tough</a>. The band's first three full-length albums may not be explicit concept albums but have some common themes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSurveillance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSurveillance">Sinister Surveillance</a> and globalisation.

</li><li> <em>Darkest Days</em> by Stabbing Westward was envisioned by the band as a four-act story, with each portraying a different emotional phase gone through after a break-up. The first act (tracks 1 through 4) is about sabotaging the relationship. The second act (tracks 5 through 9) is about lust, hope, and longing. The third act (tracks 10 through 12) is about hitting rock bottom after it is all over. The fourth act (tracks 13 through 16) is about recovery and self-respect.

As a whole, however, the album is about expected gender roles of women in the face of hypocritical societal expectations.
</li><li> <em>The Last Temptation</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a> is about a bored young man who visits a circus sideshow run by the devil and ultimately faces off with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> wrote the graphic novel adaptation.

The song was ''Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24", which gave the band a mainstream hit and inspired the members to form the Trans-Siberian Orchestra (see below) which has produced a few concept albums of its own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWakeOfMagellan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWakeOfMagellan">The Wake of Magellan</a></em>, a tale about an old sailor who attempts to kill himself by sailing out to sea and not returning.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a> has three, which together, form a triptych, a three-part story with three separate main characters. The triptych was released in the order of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar">Antichrist Superstar</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals">Mechanical Animals</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath">Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)</a>)</em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar">Antichrist Superstar</a></em> is about a revolutionary figure named The Worm, who fights the establishment of his society, rising up from nothingness into a hero, before becoming sickened by the very people he is fighting for and their adoring and sycophantic nature, and turning on them, becoming the titular Antichrist Superstar and destroying all of reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals">Mechanical Animals</a></em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">an androgynous space alien</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">turned rock star</a> named Omega (pronounced O-ME-ga, who was forced to become a rock star with a special-made band, The Mechanical Animals, whose entire purpose is to preach hollow anthems. Omega becomes drug addicted and dead to the world, before being mentally enlightened by his own foil Alpha, who is only beginning to feel emotions. Alpha and Omega observe humanity, and view them as mechanical animals, feeling little emotions. Both of them are in love with Coma White, a woman who they are not 100% certain is even real. Omega comes to term with his emotions.
</li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath">Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)</a></em> is Adam Kadmon, who lives in the city of Holy Wood. Holy Wood is a parable of America, with their creed of "Guns, God and Government", their worship of dead celebrities (called Celebritarianism) and their elevation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> as a modern day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesusChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JesusChrist">Jesus Christ</a>. Adam attempts to lead a revolution though music, but is taken into the fold and becomes another part of the machine. He falls in love with a woman called Coma Black, who may or may not be Coma White as well (more on that in a bit), and possibly impregnates her (that too) before killing himself. Finally, there is the interconnection.
<ul><li> One of the common theories goes like this. First, Coma White and Coma Black are the same woman. After the death of Adam Kadmon, she became addicted to drugs, and also had a son. This son is The Worm. Omega and Alpha both end up falling in love with Coma, but she ends up dying of a drug overdose (in the song Coma White). Omega falls into depression, becoming part of the society of Holy Wood, just like Adam Kadmon before him. The Worm grows up idolizing Omega, but ends up discovering what he has become. Killing Omega and becoming the third revolutionary to try to use music to bring about a change, The Worm becomes a hero to the masses, but their blind idolization sickens him. Turing on them, he becomes the Antichrist Superstar, bringing about the Apocalypse, taking everyone and everything with him.

It's pretty accurate too.
</li><li> The Enid's <em>Tripping the Light Fantastic</em> is apparently about the relationship between science and society.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IcedEarth">Iced Earth</a> has two released in the 90's: <em>Night of The Stormrider</em> which tells the story of a man who is betrayed by his religion and becomes, essentially, the anti-christ, and <em>The Dark Saga</em> about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a> comics (with cover art from Todd McFarlane)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearFactory">Fear Factory</a> album <em>Obsolete</em> is a concept album with a story that is like a cyberpunk version of 1984. The liner notes even fill in the gaps between the songs, tying them even closer together.
<ul><li> Slightly lesser-known is the prior album Demanufacture, about a man who hates the government machine and wishes to destroy it.
</li></ul></li><li> The German punk rock band Die &Auml;rzte released a concept album called <em>Le Frisur</em>, which revolves around... hair. It features songs like "Mein Baby War Beim Fris&ouml;r" ("My Baby Went To The Barber"), where they sing about how their girlfriend's new hairdo is so horrible they have to end the relationship, or "Medusa-Man (Serienm&ouml;rder Ralf)" ("Medusa-Man (Serial Killer Ralf)"), which is about a serial killer inspired by the mythical medusa who kills people using his hair.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdgeOfSanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdgeOfSanity">Edge of Sanity</a> had <em>Crimson</em>. <em>Crimson</em> tells the story of a "miracle" child born in an era where humans have lost the ability to reproduce, who makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> to gain magic powers and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">tyrannical queen</a>, who eventually is overthrown and cryogenically trapped in a tank of crimson fluid.
</li><li> <em>Dirt</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceInChains">Alice in Chains</a> is absolutely a concept album.
<ul><li> And that concept is consuming heroin. Not that its actually THAT obvious at least not in the more popular tracks (Dem Bones, Damn That River, Rooster). A good half of the album has at least some references to dying or wanting to die, being <em>sick</em> and generally being disconnected from the world. And then we have a bunch of songs that are just point blank about heroin, which tells you exactly what kinda sickness they are talking about. Most notably Godsmack (<em>And god's name is smack to some</em>) and Junkhead are just point blank about shooting up. It's cheery stuff.
</li><li> Given that Layne Staley did actually die from heroin use, its possible that connections are made nowadays that weren't on Dirt's first release, at least not by fans, and certainly a lot of the reviews stating about it being about heroin were written post-Stayley's death which does somewhat cloud perception. Now that doesn't mean that there's a lot of thematic unity in terms of being a ground down and hopeless, and its generally accepted to be a concept album, but its hard to say if it's intended to be exclusively about heroin or addiction in general, or if addiction is just one facet of self-disgust.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RideTheLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RideTheLightning">Ride the Lightning</a></em> is similarly focused around the theme of "death", although that just might be because <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDLZix8NVjg">Metallica likes death<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

They are about a family living in a haunted mansion who gets a visit from their Grandmother, coming home from an insane asylum. She is constantly haunted by a group of spirits known only as "Them".

Fushigi, in Japanese, means "strange" and that's a word that can best be used to describe the album. Nakamori had been one of the biggest idols in Japan at the time (along with Seiko Matsuda) but decided she needed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingCompletelyDifferent">a new sound</a> if only for an album thus she enlisted the help of the band EUROX to create an album that would embody the title: straying from the tried and true pop/idol mold with densely layered and droning instrumentation combined with Nakamori's usually powerful voice being mixed and distorted so much as to sound like an echo blending into the music in what could best be described as what would happen if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CocteauTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CocteauTwins">Cocteau Twins</a> decided to make a J-Pop album.
<ul><li> While it reached number one it caused considerable controversy as many fans complained about not being able to hear the vocals. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Nowadays it's usually regarded as one of her best albums and the one that signified her growth from just being an idol to a true musical artist.</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a>'s <em>Trans</em> is arguably a concept album exploring the collision, conflict, and melding of the traditional and the modern, nature and technology, man and machine.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> frontman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RogerWaters">Roger Waters</a> went on to make more concept albums in his solo career. <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProsAndConsOfHitchhiking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheProsAndConsOfHitchhiking">The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking</a></em> is a recounting of a man's dreams through one night, where in he questions his life, marriage, and future - through the metaphorical journey of a hitchhiker. <em>Radio KAOS</em> is about a vegetative boy, Billy, who can hear radio waves and discovers his power to transmit them after his wrongfully incarcerated brother hides a stolen cell phone under the cushion of Billy's wheelchair. He then attempts to simulate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">scare the world's population</a> into caring more about each other.
</li><li> Some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a>'s other concept albums are thematic not in the things they describe, but in the <em>idiom</em> in which they are described; examples, <em>Broadsword and the Beast</em> (using fantasy fiction as metaphor) or <em>Under Wraps</em> (spy thrillers as metaphors for interpersonal relationships).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliceCooper">Alice Cooper</a>'s <em>Flush the Fashion</em> (Many songs appear to be commentaries on life in America circa 1980) and <em>Special Forces</em> (Several songs about war and its after-effects) also focus on a common theme, but likely are not considered "true" concept albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KateBush">Kate Bush</a>'s <em>Hounds of Love</em>. Side one is a collection of songs loosely arranged around the nature of love. Side two is more cohesive - a story about a woman lost at sea (and arguably dying) who has a dream flashback to a previous life and a visit from her future self.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WarrenZevon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WarrenZevon">Warren Zevon</a> did this once with his album <em>Transverse City</em>, describing a consumer-driven hell of a dystopian future.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx">Styx</a> album <em>Paradise Theater</em>. Referencing a famous playhouse from Chicago notable for its grand architecture and sumptuous productions (the former making it a likely candidate for preservation as a historical landmark if it hadn't sadly predated that relatively modern phenomenon), the album uses the gradual fall into disrepair and eventual destruction of the theatre as a metaphor for urban flight, loss of culture, and societal decay.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KilroyWasHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KilroyWasHere">Kilroy Was Here</a></em> chronicles a future dystopia in which the Moral Music Majority bans all rock music. Kilroy, an outlaw musician, breaks out of jail disguised as a servant robot (featured in the single "Mr. Roboto"). The title is taken from World War II graffiti.
</li></ul></li><li> Ein kleines bisschen Horrorshow (A little bit horrorshow) by german band Die Toten Hosen follows the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>.
</li><li> Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFinalCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFinalCut">The Final Cut</a></em> above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Crass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Crass">Crass</a> were inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar">The Falklands War</a> to release a holistic critique of everything they saw as wrong with British society at the time, reflecting the band members' belief that all political struggles were interrelated (a concept referred to in academia as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">intersectionality<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). Reflecting this, <em>Yes Sir, I Will</em> was composed and performed as a single song with only a division between vinyl sides (and even this was cross-stitched on CD releases of the album); to this day it remains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRocking">the longest punk song ever recorded</a>. Reflecting the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Anarchism">anarchist</a> sentiments, the album's lyrics critique aspects of society such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionRantSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionRantSong">religion</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">war</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalismIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapitalismIsBad">capitalism</a>, sexism, government, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoliceSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoliceSong">police brutality</a>, censorship, and punk itself. The album closes with an appeal to the listener to take direct action. Penny Rimbaud explained:
<div class="indent">The boundaries increasingly ceased to have any relevance - prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFalklandsWar">The Falklands War</a>, one naively believed that there were separations between 'this' and 'that' and that if you dealt with 'this' then you could do 'that'... like songs - each song had its own little separate thing to deal with and <em>Yes Sir, I Will</em> is a statement about the fact that there isn't any separation - that it's all one and the same thing, that there is no single cause or single idea - there's no-one else to blame but yourself. That you can't say, "Well let's now concentrate on the Northern Ireland problem", "let's now concentrate on the problem of sexual relationships"... you can't do that - everything now is one major problem and that problem stems from yourself.

The first album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alarma">&iexcl;Alarma!</a></em> (1981), was about the corruption of the Church&mdash;a scathing satire of Christians' shortcomings. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Doppelganger">Doppelg&auml;nger</a></em> (1983) was about the corruption of the Self&mdash;a reflection and acknowledgement of one's own character flaws. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VoxHumana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VoxHumana">Vox Humana</a></em> (1984) was about the corruption of the World&mdash;an examination of the dehumanizing effects of materialism and new technology. And the final album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearfulSymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FearfulSymmetry">Fearful Symmetry</a></em> (1986), was a vision of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heaven">Heaven</a>. A single story, in four parts, ran in the liner notes of each album, further tying all of them together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eurythmics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eurythmics">Eurythmics</a> did a half-concept album, half-soundtrack for a filmed adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> (1984).

"Zero Zero". Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> adaption (1982).

It comprises 23 tracks about a Puerto Rican juvenile's metaphysical journey in which he loses his brother (more probably his soul), is reborn, is castrated and gets his manhood stolen by a huge raven. This is after he meets, makes love to, kills (unwillingly) and eats a bunch of siren-like creatures. And those are only some of the highlights.
<ul><li> Also the albums <em>From Genesis to Revelation</em> (1969) and <em>Selling England by the Pound</em> (1973) by the same band could be considered concept albums (the former being about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, and the latter being about English society and how much it's changed in the modern age).

A few of Floyd's other albums also fit the category:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere">Wish You Were Here</a></em> was a musical ode to the group's ex-frontman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett">Syd Barrett</a>, who suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> in a big way after the band released its first album (though a few songs are about corruption in the music business instead).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Animals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Animals">Animals</a></em> is a critique of capitalism, taking some (very loose) inspiration from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">Animal Farm</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> follows the main character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> and descent into drug abuse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Meddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Meddle">Meddle</a></em> could be considered this, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">officially described</a> as a loose concept album, and fans say it is the direct precursor<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7mb1r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7mb1r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7mb1r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ObscuredByClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ObscuredByClouds">Obscured by Clouds</a>" came in between the two</span> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>.

<ul><li> Additionally, each side contains a song with a <em>queen</em> of the corresponding colour in the title; and on a more meta level, the first side is primarily written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianMay">Brian May</a> (except one song by Roger Taylor) and the second side is entirely written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a> continued to enjoy success with concept albums during the early 1970s, with albums such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LolaVersusPowermanAndTheMoneygoroundPartOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LolaVersusPowermanAndTheMoneygoroundPartOne">Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MuswellHillbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MuswellHillbillies">Muswell Hillbillies</a></em>, <em>Everybody's in Show-Biz</em>. However, in the mid 1970s, they came to be seen as overindulgent excess on the part of Davies, transforming from coherent collections of songs connected by a loose theme into full-blown musical theater type productions with stories and characters that were difficult to appreciate out of context.
<ul><li> The massive <em>Preservation</em> project encompassed three LPs (Act 1, released as a single album, and Act 2, released as a double album); it was not well-received by critics and sold poorly. Follow-up albums <em>A Soap Opera</em> and <em>Schoolboys in Disgrace</em> met with a similar reception.
</li><li> By the time the band changed labels from RCA to Arista in 1977, one condition of their new contract was that no more concept albums would be produced.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis">Miles Davis</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BitchesBrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BitchesBrew">Bitches Brew</a></em> album was an experiment with an abstract fusion of jazz and rock, heavily using electronic instruments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlowsAgainstTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlowsAgainstTheEmpire">Blows Against the Empire</a></em>, the first solo album by Paul Kantner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Jefferson Airplane</a> was the first album released under the name "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonStarship">Jefferson Starship</a>" (though the band itself wouldn't be formed for another four years), is about hippies going into space in search of freedom.
</li><li> The Tubes album <em>Remote Control</em> is about a TV-obsessed man who wants to know what the real world is like, but finds that life is harder than what television makes it out to be. The last songs of the album describe the man attempting to hook up with a woman he's fallen in love with, getting rejected, and then committing suicide because he can't handle the emotional stress.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Steppenwolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Steppenwolf">Steppenwolf</a> came up with a few. <em>Monster</em> was a political statement about the times (1970). <em>For Ladies Only</em> was intended as a statement about feminism, but it didn't really come off that way. The cover art didn't help.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Autobahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Autobahn">Autobahn</a></em> = highways, <em>Radio Activity</em> = radio and nuclear power, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransEuropeExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TransEuropeExpress">Trans-Europe Express</a></em> = trains, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheManMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheManMachine">The Man-Machine</a></em>= robots,
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a>'s <em>Thick as a Brick</em> is sort of a parody of the concept album; the album, a single 43-minute suite with only one track division (where one would have had to switch sides on the original vinyl release), is presented as being an epic poem written by a preteen boy from a country town, expressing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">wangst</a> about growing up British in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. It was written because too many people kept calling the previous album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AqualungJethroTullAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AqualungJethroTullAlbum">Aqualung</a></em>, a concept album, so Ian Anderson wrote the completely over the top <em>Thick as a Brick</em> to show them what a concept album actually was.
<ul><li> The aforementioned <em>Aqualung</em> could be seen as two concept albums in one. The first LP side is a series of character sketches, and the songs on the second side have a pro-God, anti-Church message.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> claims <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">this wasn't the case</a>, and that the mis-labeling of <em>Aqualung</em> as a concept album led Ian Anderson to write <em>Thick as a Brick</em> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> of Concept albums.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>A Passion Play</em> is another, involving the afterlife and morality. A man dies (or at least has a near death experience), is judged worthy of being sent to Heaven, finds it mundane and too goody-goody to his liking, requests to go to Hell instead, but finds Hell equally mundane and too terrifyingly evil for his tastes. He opts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> on Earth, feeling "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">neither am I good nor bad</a>".
</li><li> As is the sadly underappreciated <em>Songs from the Wood</em>, a celebration of Celtic neopaganism and British folklore.
</li><li> Many of Jethro Tull's albums have "themes", for example <em>Heavy Horses</em> could be seen as some sort of sequel to <em>Songs From the Wood</em>, this time centered more on modern British countryside living.
</li><li> <em>Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!</em> is conceptual, based on an aborted TV special, the concept being about an old rock star who is unable to adapt to modern trends.
</li></ul></li><li> Donald Fagen's 1982 concept album <em>The Nightfly</em> is a look back at the world of the 50s and early 60s in which he grew up. This was later followed by <em>Kamakiriad</em>, a middle-aged man's odyssey by car, and <em>Morph the Cat</em>, focused on mortality with a side of dystopia &mdash; ending up as a concept trilogy spanning adolescence to old age.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHeadedStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHeadedStranger">Red Headed Stranger</a></em> is considered the first country music concept album. Its songs span the life of the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> from fictional Blue Rock, Montana.
</li><li> The Enid's <em>In the Region of the Summer Stars</em> has a vaguely Tarot-related concept. The follow-up, <em>Aerie Faerie Nonsense</em>, is largely based on Robert Browning's poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came".
</li><li> Scottish folk/folk-rock singer Al Stewart has dabbled in the concept album, often dealing with historical themes such as European history 1918-1938 (Between the Wars). Albums such as <em>Past, Present, and Future</em> and <em>Time Passages</em> are a few examples.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">Spinal Tap's</a> 1975 album <em>The Sun Never Sweats</em> was based around re-telling stories from British legend and mythology, and glorifying the British Empire. (The title track comes from Smalls' mis-hearing of the old saying 'The sun never sets on the British Empire'). Rather than being motivated by any artistic or political convictions, the band were just trying to cash in on the wave of nationalistic pride/chauvinism sweeping Britain at the time.
<ul><li> The religion inspired Spinal Tap concept album 'The Gospel According to Spinal Tap' which prompted the review 'On what day did God create Spinal Tap and couldn't he have rested on that day also?"
</li></ul></li><li> Rick Wakeman's <em>The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table</em>, <em>The Six Wives of Henry VIII</em>, and possibly <em>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed">Lou Reed</a> created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Berlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Berlin">Berlin</a></em>, a concept album taking place in Berlin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotelShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotelShot">Motel Shot</a></em> by Delaney &amp; Bonnie is an attempt to recreate the feeling of a late-night jam session on record.
</li><li> While not described as this, <em>Madhouse</em> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disco">Disco</a> group The Silver Convention is suggested to be such by the liner notes written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">co-producer</a> Michael Kunze, who used the song titles to describe an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> story by the protagonist. Apart from that, the four songs on side one are linked thematically, starting with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleTrack">Title Track</a>.
</li><li> That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Supertramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Supertramp">Supertramp</a>'s <em>Crime of the Century</em> is a concept album is not in debate (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms this, for example), but is it about insanity or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">man's inhumanity against man</a>, or just a story? Arguments can go either way on this.

</li><li> Many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> cast's early albums revolved around an overarching theme. For example, <em>Happy Birthday from Sesame Street</em> (the cast celebrates the listener's birthday), <em>Big Bird Leads The Band</em> (the titular bird learns about how an orchestra works), <em>The Sesame Street Fairy Tale Album</em> (the cast gets together and tells fairy tales), <em>What Time Is It On Sesame Street</em> (a bundle of tracks about various times of the day) and <em>Numbers</em> (ten tracks about the numbers 1-10) - keep in mind that these were all in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic">same year</a></em>. <em>Leads The Band</em> got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> in the form of <em>Elmo and the Orchestra</em> (2001), where Elmo learns about how an orchestra works from Big Bird and a bird orchestra.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em>, released in June 1967, with the envisioned concept of a live performance by the fictional band, because the Beatles themselves no longer wanted to do live performances. Ironically, the end result is hardly a concept album; the concept of Sgt. Pepper's band is used only for the first two tracks and the reprise of the title track. (John Lennon admitted this in a 1980 interview.) It's more known for inspiring the <em>concept</em> of a concept album, even if the idea didn't quite survive in the final product.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Some theorise</a> that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AbbeyRoad">Abbey Road</a></em> is secretly a concept album. There isn't one big idea joining all the songs, but there are a lot of small lyrical and musical cross-references between them - a specific example is repeated references to royalty ("Her Majesty", "Mean Mr Mustard", "Sun King") and the medley on side two.

</li><li> Ray Davies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinks">The Kinks</a> was excessively fond of concept albums; practically everything recorded by the band between 1967 and 1976 was a concept album. This was an asset in their earlier days; the first few albums of this period were some of the most acclaimed music of the band's career (the ones released in the 1960s were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinksAreTheVillageGreenPreservationSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKinksAreTheVillageGreenPreservationSociety">The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</a></em>, <em>Arthur</em>).
</li><li> The first few albums by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMoodyBlues">The Moody Blues</a> were all concept albums.
<ul><li> <em>Days of Future Passed</em> describes the passage of an average day, with each song representing a different time of day.
</li><li> <em>In Search of the Lost Chord</em> chronicles a search for mystical enlightenment.
</li><li> <em>On The Threshold of a Dream</em> explores the barriers between dreams and reality that exist within the human psyche.
</li><li> <em>To Our Children's Children's Children</em> is about space travel; more directly, it attempts to chronicle the thoughts and feelings that would pass through the head of a typical space traveller.
</li></ul></li><li> The oft forgotten <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SFSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SFSorrow">S.F. Sorrow</a></em> by the '60s British group, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePrettyThings">The Pretty Things</a>. S.F. Sorrow tells the story of Sebastian F. Sorrow, who endures World War I, and then returns to his love, who is killed in a dirigible accident. Sorrow falls into a severe state of depression, and is then taken on a journey by the mythical Baron Saturday. The Baron throws Sorrow into a room of mirrors, where he sees the horrible truths and revelations of his life, ending with Sorrow secluding himself from society and building a mental and emotional wall. And this was ten years before Roger Waters had even thought of The Wall yet. Notable for being considered one of the first Rock Operas. Produced at Abbey Road, during the same time The Beatles were recording <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> were recording <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePiperAtTheGatesOfDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePiperAtTheGatesOfDawn">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SketchesOfSpain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SketchesOfSpain">Sketches of Spain</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis">Miles Davis</a> has a Spanish atmosphere and all the tracks' titles refer to the country in one way or another.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhoSellOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhoSellOut">The Who Sell Out</a></em>, released the same year as <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>, is made to sound like a British pop pirate radio station of the time - complete with faux-ads for Heinz baked beans, the Charles Atlas course, and a London car dealership. The band would later take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> one step further by starting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockOpera">Rock Opera</a> with <em>Tommy</em> and <em>Quadrophenia</em>.
</li><li> Japan's first concept album was by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KenjiSawada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KenjiSawada">The Tigers</a>, Human Renescence, and was entirely based on the concept of the Tigers dressing regally, so composers Koichi Sugiyama and Kunihiko Murai decided to make an entire album based on their image as royalty, complete with rather large orchestral arrangements, which made most of the songs notoriously difficult for the band to perform live.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds">Pet Sounds</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SMiLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SMiLE">SMiLE</a></em>, arguably. The first one is a cycle of songs relating to romantic relationships which can be seen to tell a story of infatuation leading to disillusionment (although Wilson denies there was a consciously intended storyline behind the songs, many critics and listeners have interpreted one as existing anyway), while the second one is apparently a psychedelic journey through American history and across the continent. <em>Smile</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladLyrics">Word Salad Lyrics</a> don't really help much with discerning what the concept is beyond that, though.
<ul><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleDeuceCoupe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LittleDeuceCoupe">Little Deuce Coupe</a></em> is considered an early example of a concept album, as all the songs (save one) are about cars.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Ark 2</em>, the only album released by Flaming Youth (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilCollins">Phil Collins</a>' first band) is about humanity evacuating into space because Earth is dying.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndyWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndyWilliams">Andy Williams</a>' <em>Under Paris Skies</em> is a collection of English translations of French popular songs, with the exception of one song which he sang in iffily-accented French.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1940s and 1950s&nbsp;</div><div id="folder8" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The earliest example of a concept album so far is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DustBowlBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DustBowlBallads">Dust Bowl Ballads</a></em> (1940) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WoodyGuthrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WoodyGuthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>. All the songs are built around one narrative and one theme: the hardships of the local population during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a>, specifically in Oklahoma, where both economic recession and dust storms hit everybody hard.
</li><li> Another early example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InTheWeeSmallHours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InTheWeeSmallHours">In the Wee Small Hours</a></em> from 1955. The songs, all ballads, were specifically recorded for the album, and organized around a central mood of late-night isolation and aching lost love, with the album cover strikingly reinforcing that theme. The centrality of lyrical theme and musical mood (rather than by a narrative like <em>Dust Bowl Ballads</em>) gives it a strong case for being the first concept album as currently understood. Since concept albums are most often associated with various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">rock</a> genres (if asked, many will name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> as the first of the kind, which is all kinds of wrong), people tend to ignore <em>In the Wee Small Hours</em>, making this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>.
<ul><li> Songwriter/arranger/producer Gordon Jenkins (who often worked with Sinatra) recorded several "suites" (<em>Manhattan Tower</em>, <em>California</em>, <em>Seven Dreams</em>) in the 1940s and 1950s that mixed songs, instrumental passages and narration, which can be seen as early concept albums. <em>Seven Dreams</em> is best known now because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> used one of its songs as the basis for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">"Folsom Prison Blues".</a>
</li></ul></li><li> "Milestones" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis">Miles Davis</a> was an album-long experiment with modal harmonies.
</li><li> <em>Time Out</em> by the Dave Brubeck Quartet featured songs all in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime">unusual time signatures</a>. The first song, "Blue Rondo ala Turk" is in 9/8, played as "<em>1</em>-2-<em>1</em>-2-<em>1</em>-2 <em>1</em>-2-3". The third song, saxophonist Paul Desmond's famous "Take Five", is in 5/4. "Kathy's Waltz" is in 3/4, but the drums and piano solo are in <em>4</em>/4. And so on.
<ul><li> Brubeck and Desmond continued writing stuff in this vein for a while, enough to make up two sequel albums, <em>Time Further Out</em> and <em>Time in Outer Space</em>, one of which features a composition by Desmond called "Eleven Four."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunRa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SunRa">Sun Ra</a>, who started performing as early as 1934 but only gained notability from the late 1950s on, made many albums which mixed space travel imagery with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Egyptian Mythology</a>, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFuturisticSoundsOfSunRa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFuturisticSoundsOfSunRa">The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra</a></em>. All of them are in that regard concept albums because they are built around the same theme.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DukeEllington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DukeEllington">Duke Ellington</a>'s <em>Black, Brown and Beige</em> was, in Duke's own words, "a tone parallel to the history of the Negro in America." The studio album was released in 1958&mdash;and this was a truncated revision of an even longer "jazz symphony" that Duke performed live in 1943.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFourFreshmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFourFreshmen">The Four Freshmen</a> often recorded albums centered around a musical concept, like <em>Four Freshmen and Five Trombones</em>, or a lyrical theme, like <em>Voices in Latin</em> and <em>Voices in Love</em>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older Than Radio&nbsp;</div><div id="folder9" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Perhaps this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a> and only needed recording technology to catch up with what was already there. An example from the 1880's is Hector Berlioz' <em>Symphonie Fantastique</em>, which the composer quite explicitly wrote to chronicle the descent of one man (possibly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>) into depression and suicidal despair for unrequited love of a woman. The first movement (track?) is a calm peaceful pastoral scene; the second a nightmarish stately ball where he glimpses the woman and falls in love as the waltz theme swirls out of control; the third a lonely melancholy walk; the fourth a "trial" of his sanity and his passage to the guillotine, having been found guilty; the fifth a macabre Dance of The Dead and Black Mass.
</li><li> This is indeed much older than the modern incarnation of albums. Before albums we had symphonies, concertos, sonatas and suites. Any one of those could revolve around a concept. They were at the very least pieces of music that went in a specific sequence and went well together, but may actually had concepts or stories to tell as well. Listen to Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons" (1720's!) or Handel's Messiah (1740's). Suites in the more modern sense of the word (originating around the early 1900's) are probably the best precursor to the concept album. Unlike sonatas, concertos or symphonies a suite has no requirements on structure or instruments beyond having multiple pieces. Many suites were selections from ballets, plays, operas or even film, but they didn't have to be. Gustav Holst's "The Planets" (1920's) is just a collection of pieces about each planet in an astrological sense. Had it come two or three decades later it would certainly have earned the label of a concept album.
