<div class="indent"><strong>Touma:</strong> Why am I experiencing such a happy event? I don't remember raising any flags like this at all.

<ul><li> Yukari-sensei's 2nd-year students are discussing what to do for the Culture Fest, and Osaka suggests that they do a haunted house that's like a caf&eacute;, inverting an idea expressed earlier. Shortly, Kagura arrives and suggests the same thing, thinking it would be a "killer idea".
<div class="indent"><strong>Osaka:</strong> Ooh, the same wavelength! <br><strong>Kagura:</strong> Errr, same as what?
</div></li><li> Also, Sakaki and Osaka manage to independently imagine Chiyo's father in the <em>exact</em> same way. (As a <em>giant, floating orange cat thing.</em>) Well, we hope it's their imagination.
</li><li> At one point in the manga, Yukari stops in the middle of a lesson to muse about a tongue twister (in the English version, it's "She sells seashells"). Everyone looks confused...except Osaka, who nods knowingly.
</li><li> The is also implied to be the reason why Osaka is so good at word puzzles and brain-twisters &mdash; the sideways logic patterns one usually has to take up to think of and solve them is just how she normally is.

<ul><li> During their tennis match, Light and L have almost identical internal monologues, without communicating. Of course the point of this is to illustrate that the two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>.
</li><li> Light constantly pats himself on the back for choosing the morally uptight Teru Mikami to act on his behalf: anything Light can't do on his own or say aloud, Mikami does, and without even asking. Naturally, being the egotist he is, Light never considered the possibility that someone that acts <em>so</em> much like him could be a problem. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oops.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widget Series</a> <em>Ippatsu Kiki Musume</em>, Kunyan wakes up with her hair caught in the drain of a bathtub filled with water, unable to free herself and facing imminent drowning. She "realizes" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">since people take in air through their mouths and release it through their butts, she should be able to reverse the process and breathe through her butt.</a> Naturally, it doesn't work. Her friend Linda enters, realizes what's happening and...attempts CPR on Kunyan's butt, having come to the same conclusion. Their friend Naja, supposedly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneWoman">Only Sane Woman</a> of the group, <em>also</em> comes to the same conclusion, and runs off to get an enema in order to help save Kunyan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora">Toradora!</a></em> has, at the start of an episode, Ryuji having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare">Catapult Nightmare</a> in which Taiga agrees to marry him. However, because Taiga refers to him as "her dog" much of the time, the dream features him getting a dog house, while his mother (dressed as a dog) shows off all of Taiga's puppies. Taiga, also dressed as a dog, tells Ryuji they're his, which is when he wakes up. Moments later, Taiga tells Ryuji "I had an unpleasant dream. You were a dog, and the dog was my husband. Anyway, it was the worst dream ever."
</li><li> In one chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>, Nabeshima is fighting Myouga Unzen, a character who can only speak and understand a numbers-based language. At one point, Nabeshima comments that Myouga is going to "pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dragonball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Dragonball">Dragon Ball</a>" and get a speed boost by dropping her weights. Myouga picks out the words "dragon ball" and guesses that Nabeshima thinks she's going to get a speed boost.
<ul><li> Later in the chapter, Nabeshima manages to get the upper hand (while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">twisting one of Myouga's taunts</a>), and Myouga exclaims "You damn cheater!" One of Nabeshima's classmates asks Medaka (who learned how to translate Myouga's language) if Myouga just said "You cheater!", simply because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">everyone who fights Nabeshima says that</a> at some point.
</li></ul></li><li> In all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>, the only person who actually seems to think alike and see eye-to-eye with Sousuke seems to be Atsunobu Hayashimizu, the president of the Student Council. The guy agrees with Sousuke's weird, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">outlandish conclusions,</a> and supports his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriggerHappy">violent,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">destructive ways.</a>
</li><li> During the climax of the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> movie, "Captured In Her Eyes", when a (currently amnesiac) Ran asks Conan why he's protecting her, he proclaims that he "loves her, more than any other person on this Earth". Once her memory returns, Ran comes to the conclusion that Conan was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">intentionally</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">mimicking how they'd been told</a> Ran's father proposed to her mother. Conan is just a little disgusted with himself to realize it was, in fact, this trope.
<ul><li> In the series proper, the fact that Kogoro and Eri actually are more alike then they're willing to admit (both preferring the same food, liking the same color, remembering their first date by dressing up in the clothes they wore, etc.) is used to show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> At the beginning of one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiGiCharat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiGiCharat">Di Gi Charat</a></em>, Dejiko is plotting to make a naughty doujinshi using two of the store's customers (both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">named Takuro.</a> Gema, seeing the look on her face, tells her that if she's thinking of making a naughty doujinshi featuring those two, she'd better not. Dejiko is thoroughly pissed that he was able to read her thoughts so exactly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a>:</em>
<ul><li> During Fishman Island, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Luffy manages to smuggle Princess Shirahoshi</a> out of the castle, having hid her in her pet shark's mouth. Brook argues that since he only saw Luffy and Megalo leave the castle, Luffy couldn't have kidnapped her. King Neptune immediately suggests that he might have hid Shirahoshi in Megalo's mouth. Everyone in his court bursts out laughing at the incredulity of the thought.
</li><li> Zoro and Luffy seem to follow the same "logic" at times:
<ul><li> In Fishman Island, Luffy explains why he doesn't want to be a hero by claiming that, if there was a huge piece of meat, a hero would share it and a pirate would eat it, and Luffy wants to eat meat! Near the end of the arc, Zoro applies the exact same logic, only substituting grog instead of meat without hearing Luffy say it before. Nami, who hears both explanations, is not amused.
</li><li> In Skypiea, when the Straw Hats are forcibly split up, Zoro's group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VineSwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VineSwing">swings across vines</a> several times to explore the nearby jungle. Every time they do so, Zoro gives a "Tarzan yell", to Nami's disbelief. Meanwhile, Luffy's group is fighting Satori in the jungle, and Luffy ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VineSwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VineSwing">swinging from a vine</a> once or twice. What does he do? Give a Tarzan yell. Possibly Usopp as well, since he named his new grappling-hook-swing-rope invention the "Usopp AaahAhAaahh", but it's unknown if he planned that name from the beginning or was inspired by Luffy's Tarzan call.
</li><li> An example that occurred near the beginning of the series: Luffy and Zoro both meet Gaimon, a man who's stuck in a treasure chest. Both of them independently arrive at the question "Are you a boxed son?". This is a pun on the Japanese concept of 'boxed daughters', referring to the practice of sheltering girls, but considering it's associated with social criticism and most definitely doesn't refer to a literal box, it's a really stupid pun. Luffy and Zoro were completely serious.
</li><li> In Little Garden, when Zoro is about to be turned into a human candle by Mr. 3, he suggests to Brogy that they chop their legs off in order to escape. Much, much later, on Whole Cake Island, Luffy is imprisoned and nailed to a wall by Big Mom's subordinates. He tries to escape by tearing his hands off, and suggests that Nami do the same.
</li></ul></li><li> Oden and Whitebeard having the exact same reaction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoJustNoReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoJustNoReaction">utter disgust</a> when asked by Toki to act as tour guides for her in Wano.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Proverbs episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em>, in anticipation of Miu's arrival through the window, the other girls guess what she's going to scream as she comes in. Chika just about nails it.
</li><li> At the beginning of one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TamakoMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TamakoMarket">Tamako Market</a></em>, Dela sees a Jizo statue and wonders aloud if if can be used as a bludgeoning weapon. At the end of the episode, another character from the same island as Dela sees the statue and wonders the exact same thing.

</li><li> Nanamine's one-shot, Classroom of Truth, seems like a ripoff of Mashiro and Takagi's The Two Earths, but Mashiro and Takagi both realize that since The Two Earths was never published, Nanamine came up with that idea by coincidence.

<ul><li> In a Paperinik (Donald's superhero/antihero alter ego) story Donald had Gyro invent a device that brings someone an hour forward in time, so Daisy would understand how <em>he</em> felt every time he was late to their dates due him having to arrest criminals as Paperinik. After finding out about the device (that he had used as a crime-fighting weapon as Paperinik) Daisy is initially outraged...but when Donald comes to apologize, she <em>thanks him for helping her understand</em>, even saying it was very romantic.

</li><li> In the final episodes of <em>Reconstruction</em>, Washington explains that he's going to activate an EMP device to kill the Meta, but the Reds correct him, calling it an "emp," much to Washington's annoyance. When he does activate it, the machine says something to the effect of "Activating emp." Washington's last words are pure indignation.
</li><li> In the prequel episode "Fifty Shades of Red", we see that Sarge competed against other potential commanding officers for the Blood Gulch position. Every other sergeant candidate had the exact same mindset as him, to the point where they all started saying the same thing in unison.

<ul><li> One specific example:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homestar:</strong> <em>[wearing a pair of shades covered in yellow paint]</em> Oh, hello, Dripping Yellow Madness! <br><strong>Strong Sad:</strong> What? I'm Strong Sad! Dripping Yellow Madness moved away after fifth grade! <br><em>[later]</em> <br><strong>Homestar:</strong>The sales representative I dealt with gave them to me...free of charge. I believe...his name was Stan. <br><strong>Bubs:</strong> Stan?! I fired that guy after the fifth grade! <br><em>[yet later]</em> <br><strong>Strong Bad:</strong> Hey, The Cheat.

</li><li> "Car Trip" and Homestar's usage of the phrase "jumbo/LARGE".
</li><li> "Strong Bad is a Bad Guy" has this relatively ordinary example:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homestar:</strong> <em>[walks up to Strong Bad, Strong Mad, and The Cheat, who were previously talking about tattoos]</em> Hey guys! H'whatcha teekenbot? <br><strong>Strong Bad:</strong> We're talking about something cool and interesting. You wouldn't understand. <br><strong>Homestar:</strong> Oh, tattoos, huh?
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> That same cartoon starts with Strong Mad saying his tattoo of choice would be "a glowy box". This is also one of Homestar's ideas once he joins in.

He concludes that it's because he's either a narcissist or just that girly. Later, at the birthday party after everyone has changed gender, Grace asks Susan and Sarah why Tedd seems uncomfortable with her in male form when he's already seen her as himself. Susan theorizes that Tedd's a narcissist, and Sarah adds the "Or he's just that girly" comment.
<ul><li> Later Grace reassures Tedd that it's okay for him to be more weirded out by a male version of her than by her transforming into him because "It feels different to be with one's own self...and couples switching bodies is number thirty-seven on your list of weird things you like. It's also possible that you're just that girly, but I don't think you're a narcissist."
</li><li> Also, toward the beginning of the "Night Out" arc, Nanase uses her fairy doll spell to talk to Ellen.

It turns out that Donovan and the orc had the same phrasebook.
<ul><li> Also, near the beginning of the comic's run, Sigfried meets both Lady Tavoria and Dominic. Both are hung up on his name, and ask him if they can just call him "Siggy."

<ul><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Haley</a> says that Thanh has been "dominated" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkChick">Tsukiko</a>, and both <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0521.html">Belkar<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0524.html">a random cleric<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> assume she is referring to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualKink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualKink">consensual bondage</a> rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> spell.
</li><li> One example was inadvertently created by making a reference to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: in one of the Dragon magazine strips, when Belkar accidentally dispels Elan's clothes, Phil Rodriguez says, "He's invisible!"

</li><li> Their joint Let's Play of Fibbage 2 with Funhaus had a question about an unusual turf war. Jeremy and Gavin both wrote "Blades of Grass", while the real answer was "Ice Cream Men".
</li><li> The WWE Let's Plays tend to have this with the character-created characters, but the second session (2K14) is the standout example. The six created characters are Yarrgarita (Geoff), wearing a towel around his waist, Mr Diddlez (Ray), a champion of diddling ashamed of himself also in a towel, Gavin and Michael's...abominations, whose names of "Blue Anus" and "Dick Demolisher" both got censored, and Beardo V2 and An Inconvenience (Jack and Ryan) are fat and buff at the same time with weirdly coloured faces. The group regret that they didn't do a tag-team match.
</li><li> Let's Play Quiplash, both parts.
<ul><li> The first game has the first round devolve into racism; including "Hitler" as the answer in separate questions. The second round devolves into insulting Gavin. There's also the gem of "The worst secret to come out over Thanksgiving." The answers? "Dad fucks turkeys" from Michael, and from actual dad Ryan, "I fucked the turkey. And the cranberry sauce." The gang are well aware of this trope.
</li><li> The RouLetsPlay of the second has two primary examples; "A weird thing for a baseball umpire to lean down and say to catcher." Jack and Michael put down, "I want to lick your butthole," and "I want to lick your taint", sending them and Lindsay into gales of laughter, while the others curse them.

Later, DW asks Timmy and Tommy what they know about green potato chips and they respond, "you mean the poison ones?" She faints before knowing Binky ate one too. This is based in truth, however. The green spots on a potato contain solanine and chaconine, both glycoalkaloid toxins. Deep frying tends to leach these toxins out of the potato, and it would take a fairly excessive number of green chips to make one ill.

Actually, bleeding from the ears, mixed with a clear fluid, following a head trauma is a severe warning sign that the injury is far more severe than a simple knock on the head, as it indicates the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, it could actually just be a case of both of them knowing that, with no ear-bleeding, there's a good chance he would be "fine".

<ul><li> In "The Cartridge Family", this happens with references to the King of England:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution. <br><strong>Lisa:</strong> Dad, the 2nd Amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. It has no meaning today. <br><strong>Homer:</strong> You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. <em>[shoving her repeatedly]</em> Do you want that? Huh? Do ya!? <br><em>[later on, at the NRA meeting]</em> <br><strong>Krusty:</strong> Guns aren't toys! They're for family protection, hunting dangerous or delicious animals, and keeping the King of England out of your face!
</div><ul><li> Made even funnier when you realize England hasn't had a king since the 50s. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E1KampKrusty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E1KampKrusty">Krusty has met Queen Elizabeth II at least once</a>.

</li><li> And of course, this little gem:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> <em>[after being questioned about liking ballet]</em> Marjorie, <em>please.</em> I enjoy <em>all</em> the meats of our cultural stew. Ah, ballet. <br><strong>Homer's Mind:</strong> <em>[pictures a scene at the circus, where a bear is driving a tiny car]</em> <br><em>[at the nuclear plant...]</em> <br><strong>Carl:</strong> Wanna get a beer with us? <br><strong>Homer:</strong> <em>[angrily]</em> Can't.

</div></li><li> When Homer asks Professor Frink for invention ideas, Frink explains that he can find a new use for an existing item. Homer suggests hamburger earmuffs with Frink humoring the idea. After Homer leaves, Frink then pulls that invention out and says he will have it in stores first.
</li><li> "Simpson and Delilah":
<ul><li> Lenny convinces Homer to use his medical insurance to pay for hair tonic, sarcastically saying that Mr. Burns wouldn't miss the money since for him it would just mean "one less ivory backscratcher". When Mr. Burns later finds out about the charges, he's furious because he was planning on buying an ivory backscratcher.
</li><li> When Homer first saw the effects of the hair tonic on him, he went out of house wearing his pajamas and ran through several parts of town. At some point, he met a man doing the same. Each one pointed at the other and mentioned the hair tonic's name.
</li></ul></li><li> In the episode where Homer gets a new assistant who turns on him and takes his job, he uses a secret Flanders told him to turn the tables. When asked where he learnt the secret, he declines to say, but states the initials are S.F. She immediately recognizes this as Stupid Flanders.
</li><li> While Halloween episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">aren't canon</a>, there's this exchange from when the school cafeteria suddenly starts serving delicious food:

</div></li><li> When Homer teaches a class on building a successful marriage, he tries to bluff that him eating an orange and not paying attention to the class was really a metaphor for a successful marriage. No one buys it. Groundskeeper Willie says if he'd wanted to watch someone eat an orange, he'd have taken the orange-eating class. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">Gilligan Cut</a> to Moleman teaching an orange-eating class, stating that eating an orange is a lot like a good marriage.
</li><li> "Marge in Chains" has an infomercial where Troy McClure, advertising a juicing machine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooIncompetentToOperateABlanket">crushes an orange against his forehead</a> and then announces "Until now, this was the only way to get juice from an orange."

<ul><li> The CIA makes an unpleasant discovery:
<div class="indent"><strong>Agent Thompson:</strong> We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch. ...A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina. <br><strong>Agent Waters:</strong> It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.
</div></li><li> Later, Cartman is contacted.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Thompson:</strong> Well, we've just arrived in your town. <br><strong>Cartman:</strong> Why? Did you find something? <br><strong>Mr. Thompson:</strong> Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz. <br><strong>Cartman:</strong> <em>[beat]</em> A snuke?
</div></li><li> In "It Hits the Fan", Cartman gets upset that the word "shit" is no longer offensive, and starts using "meekrob" as a swear word. Later on, Cartman sees a list of all of the "cursed words", and one of them actually is "meekrob".
</li><li> And then there's "Pinkeye", where Stan and Wendy planned to come to school on Halloween both dressed as Raggedy Anne and Andy (which was apparently supposed to be romantic somehow), but Wendy decided it was lame and changed her costume to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Chewbacca</a> without telling him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">she assumed he'd decide the same</a>). When Stan gets to school, he is disgusted to find that <em>everyone else in the class</em> except two of his friends and Mr. Garrison came dressed as Chewbacca (everyone even included Garrison's hand puppet, Mr. Hat).
</li><li> Or the episode "Here Comes the Neighborhood" where the town is set upon by rich people (who just so happen to be black), and the rank-and-file residents try to get rid of them. Mr. Garrison proposes two plans that <em>look</em> terribly racist: burning "lower-case Ts", for "Time to leave", on their lawns, and dressing up like ghosts (that look like Klansmen). In both cases, the rich people see these displays as exactly what Garrison intended them to be. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: The original Ku Klux Klan was based in Pulaski, Tennessee and organized by Civil War veterans, who sometimes dressed up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetGhost">Bedsheet Ghosts</a> in a jokey attempt to scare blacks.
</li><li> When Stan and Kyle figured out a man at the rodeo was conning them, they called "shenanigans". In reaction, several people got their brooms and started chasing the conman away. Later on, the Mayoress showed up and asked what was going on, a passerby told her someone called "shenanigans" and she hurried for her broom.
</li><li> When the main characters asked Doctor Mephisto to create a genetic combination of an elephant and a pig, Mephisto claimed it to be impossible and mentioned a "Loverboy" song stating it to justify his claim. Later on, when they told Chef about their desire to make a pig-elephant, Chef also brought up the song.
</li><li> In the second episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Wendy</a> writes an environmental report on dolphins, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Cartman</a> comments that if dolphins were so smart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">they wouldn't live in igloos</a>. When Wendy gets her paper back, she's annoyed to see the grader left the same comment.

Both Cartman and Mr. Stotch suggest that the UPS man must be some sort of weird pervert, since apparently no <em>normal</em> man would want to sleep with Mrs. Broflovski.
</li><li> In "Crack Baby Athletic Association", Cartman dresses and talks like a Southern slave owner as part of a satirization of the NCAA controversies of them not paying their players. Later, the president of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a>, who yanks the rights for crack baby basketball away from the boys, is also depicted as a slave owner.
</li><li> In "Major Boobage," apparently everyone sees the <em>same</em> hallucination after huffing cat urine. Kenny and Gerald end up getting in a fight over the mysterious woman from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a></em> pastiche, and when Gerald gives a speech at the end about how she isn't real, Randy remarks that "You never get a good look at her naked boobs anyway."
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Spliced">Spliced</a></em>, when Peri and Entree are sent flying in the air and are about to fall.

<div class="indent"><strong>Squidward:</strong> We've got to do something! <br><strong>Mr. Krabs:</strong> It won't do any good; I've seen this before.

Doctor? Hospital? ...Won't do any good!? ...<em>Eleven times!?</em>
</div></li><li> From the same episode, Squidward asks the pirates what flavor pie it is, and three different pirates say "cherry" "apple" and "raspberry". Later, when the "pie" reaches SpongeBob's lower intestine, SpongeBob says "Something just hit my lower intestine. Tastes like...cherry...no, maybe grape...blueberry?". Though possibly subverted in that he never ate the pie bomb at all.
</li><li> Also done in the episode where SpongeBob runs rampant with Mermaid Man's shrink ray.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> fairy tale seems pretty widespread.
</li><li> A myth about an otherworldly shapeshifter woman who transforms from her natural form to that of a beautiful maiden through the use of her garment exists. A young male passerby spies her bathing and (eventually or immediately) steals her garment, hiding it away and forcing her to marry him and bear his children. After many years, she discovers her garment (sometimes herself, sometimes because her husband permits her to see it, and sometimes because of her unknowing child finding it) and, taking it, departs forever, leaving husband and children. This rather specific tale is that of the Orkney and Shetland selkie, the Japanese Tennyo, the Swedish Swan Maiden, the German Three Swans, or one of several other similar stories together classified as "AaTh 400".
</li><li> An apparent real-life example is documented <a class="urllink" href="http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/archives/010764.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheard">Overheard</a>.

</li><li> Newton and Leibniz both independently came up with modern calculus (and, in fact, other mathematicians were toying with the idea as well), resulting in Newton accusing Leibniz of plagiarizing his work. Though they did arrive on the theory from opposite directions (Newton started with derivatives and Leibniz started with integrals), so today we give them both credit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUS">Dennis the Menace (US)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DennisTheMenaceUK">Dennis the Menace (UK)</a></em>, both stories about a mischievous boy in a red-and-black striped shirt, debuted the same day. There's no evidence that they influenced each other.
</li><li> The letters section of <em>Car And Driver's</em> December 2010 features two letters about the demise of Ford's Mercury division. Both letters lament that there will never be a trim level of the Marquis called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">de Sade.</a>
</li><li> Might fit better under mythology, but a <em>lot</em> of the Creation myths involve the world getting flooded at some point, with very few people left to repopulate. Take that as you will. One theory is that the flood myth comes from the Hudson Bay finally emptying after the last ice age retreated far enough north. The resulting surge of water swelled the banks of the Mediterranean and Black Seas - moving the coastline possibly several hundred meters in the latter case. Thus, flood over a large area.
<ul><li> However, the much likelier (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">albeit considerably more boring</a>) theory is simply that early agrarian civilizations, and indeed many early settlements in general, lived near rivers due to their fertile land and the ready available water. Thus floods are universal because everyone collectively learned why they are called floodplains.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/NuPogodi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/NuPogodi">Nu, Pogodi!</a></em> are often compared; the latter&#146;s creator said he&#146;d never heard of the former before the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>.
</li><li> Bows and arrows were invented in ancient times in numerous parts of the world completely independently of each other.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney">The Hero's Journey</a> is perhaps the ultimate example: If storytelling has ever caught on in a culture, the people have at least one story that fits The Hero's Journey.
</li><li> This is actually a fairly commonly encountered trope in many different retail positions. <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/stared-to-death/29736">This Not Always Right entry<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> aside, how many times have you run into a sales associate who just happened to share a wavelength with you when you while you were shopping, or had a friend describe just such an employee?
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution">Convergent Evolution<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, where similar features evolve in different creatures independent of each other.
</li><li> On July 4, 2014, the Independence Day themed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Blondie">Blondie</a></em> and <em>Drabble</em> comic strips had essentially the same punchline: dogs are afraid of fireworks. Furthermore, the <em>Blondie</em> strip had Daisy on the couch hiding under a pillow while the <em>Drabble</em> strip had Wally hiding under the couch.
</li><li> Chinese mythology, and by extension Japanese and Korean as well has a legend about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonRabbit">Moon Rabbit</a>, but in a very distant civilization, the Aztecs developed a similar story.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_cognate">False Cognates<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are examples of words in different languages that independently mean the same thing and sound the same. They appear to be cognates, which are words with a related heritage, but they are actually completely coincidental. An example would be how many languages have the same word for mother, "ma" (probably as a result of that being a sound babies can make easily).
<ul><li> An interesting example is the (now-extinct) Mbabaram language of Australia, in which a domestic canine companion was referred to as "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dog#Mbabaram">dog<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>"
</li></ul></li><li> Every single culture in the world has some variant on the pancake.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant">The Rant</a> for <a class="urllink" href="http://www.galactanet.com/comic/view.php?strip=427">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaseyAndAndy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CaseyAndAndy">Casey and Andy</a></em> strip, Andy Weir notes that a reader linked him to a TV series that, like his webcomic, had a villain named Dr. X. While the name itself isn't exactly unusual for a villainous name, the coincidence is made even odder by the fact that the writer for the TV series (and inventor of the other Dr. X) is <em>also</em> named Andy Weir.
</li><li> A scene from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">Furious 7</a></em> has Dominic's team perform an attack on an enemy convoy using vehicles modified for off-road use. They look like they might have been inspired by Dirt or Raid spec vehicles from the video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCrew">The Crew</a></em> except that the scene was shot while <em>The Crew</em> was still in development.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AxeCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AxeCop">Axe Cop</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlePrincessMadelyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattlePrincessMadelyn">Battle Princess Madelyn</a></em> both happen to be stories conceived by the vivid imagination of two separate kids, filtered through their professionally-talented older relatives. The main big difference is that one's a webcomic and the other's a video game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> author Cori Falls created a pair of OC Team Rocket members named &#147;Annie&#148; and &#147;Oakley&#148; about a year or so before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> would dub <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHeroes">Pok&eacute;mon Heroes</a></em> and use those names for the film&#146;s villains. This is a particularly unlikely coincidence because 1) Annie Oakley wasn&#146;t an outlaw, so she didn&#146;t technically fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>, and 2) the movie villains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoneWolfBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoneWolfBoss">weren&#146;t even affiliated with Team Rocket</a> in the Japanese original. The major differences were that Cori&#146;s characters were friends with the main Rocket trio (the movie&#146;s version is antagonistic toward them) and her Oakley was male, and he and Annie were a couple&#151;and since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Cori was something of a homophobe</a>, this caused her to complain after the movie came out and used the character names in a different context, making readers assume she had created a femmeslash pairing.
</li><li> Unlike in fiction, it's unlikely one person <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiscoveryOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDiscoveryOfFire">"discovered" how to use fire</a>. It's theorized that this occurred repeatedly, in several different areas, over the course of time.
</li><li> The cartoon series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> and the book series <em>La Famille Trop'd Filles</em> are both about a family with many daughters and only one son (albeit with slight differences in character focus), and are both by creators of American origin. They would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransatlanticEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransatlanticEquivalent">foreign equivalents of each other</a>, except for the fact that they were made 4 years apart. To top it off, they even have tie-in comic books.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoldenRule">The Golden Rule</a> is rather famous for the fact that it appears in many different religious texts, many of which were written in cultures isolated from each other.
</li><li> German has a saying <em>Zwei Dumme, ein Gedanke</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2zsw7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2zsw7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2zsw7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Two Idiots, One Thought</em></span>
</li><li> Western and Eastern civilizations both came up with the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragons.</a>
</li><li> As illustrated <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPuu_VE7KOA">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, there are simply some jokes that are easy ones anyone can come up with and to some people they aren't even <em>jokes</em>. This can overlap with cryptomnesia, the phenomenon that people forget that something is not an original idea as described <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXxfSHND8iE">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Joke thievery is still stealing, but it can be hard to determine. Even <em>more</em> examples are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HS4EzVaImc">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> There are too many examples to really list of people doing a subversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">It's a Wonderful Plot</a> where everyone's life is better. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker">Doug Walker</a> was amazed at the sheer number of times it had been done before, thinking it was an original idea for one of his videos on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> has an entire segment called "Newscasters Agree" devoted to this, the longest being <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA">It's okay, you can admit it, if you've bought an item or two or ten for yourself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and the most redundant being <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZElSajQdOo">Is It Time For Dogs To Have A Social Network Of Their Own?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Of course, many of these newscasters probably share writers, but still certainly an example.
