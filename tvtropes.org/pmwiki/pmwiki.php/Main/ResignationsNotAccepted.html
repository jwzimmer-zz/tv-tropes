<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman&#12290;</a></em>, writers cannot simply end their series when they want to, as long as there's still some life in the series, and if they simply abandon their series, they will never be able to write for Jump again. Mashiro and Takagi manage to secure a compromise in which they quit their current series to launch another that can compete with Eiji's works, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eiji himself cancels his own series after becoming the most popular manga artist in Jump</span>.
</li><li> A very persuasive example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> where Griffith was less than willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">let his best fighter leave him and pursue his own goals in life, feeling that he belonged to him and never before being denied by his minions in life</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Very much less than willing</a>.

Soul Reapers that leave active service officially take "extended leave" and could theoretically be recalled to service at a moment's notice. Soul Reapers officially recorded as "retired" have either died in battle, been promoted to the Royal Guard or been clandestinely shuffled off to a secret prison where people who are considered a potential danger to society - but who have committed no actual crimes - are locked away forever.

After Higuchi warns him that a statement like that might get him killed and Ooi reminds him that he's too deeply involved to escape blame, he apologizes and retracts his statement, but later gets killed anyway.

<ul><li> The Shichibukai are essentially mercenaries, pirates who work for the government to fight and scare off other pirates. So naturally, if one decides to quit, they go back to being pirates, i.e. enemy #1. It doesn't help that the Shichibukai is made up of pirates with massive former bounties, so as soon as they quit, their bounties are reinstated, leading them to be high-profile targets.
</li><li> The Big Mom Pirates also have this; once you're a part of the crew, you <em>can't leave</em>. Big Mom claims that if someone of strength wants to withdraw, they must turn over one of their limbs, but according to her daughter Praline, <em>no one</em> has successfully lived to escape Big Mom's control;. Only <em>one</em> of her daughters managed to pull this off, and as such Big Mom wants to <em>kill her.</em>

In fact, Berg Katse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">asks a girl who was told she could leave if she completed a special mission why she ever thought she could leave Galactor alive</a>!

The fact that most of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil">didn't join willingly</a> was a big part of that, but the Earthbound Gods were willing to control them like puppets to make sure they didn't actually turn against them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(And even <em>that</em> didn't work in Carly's case.)</span> Fortunately, the Dark Signers were revived as normal humans after the Earthbound Gods were defeated for good (except those who declined the chance that they were offered because they had become Dark Signers intentionally).

<ul><li> A standard in evil organizations (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hydra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hydra">Hydra</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>) and villains' mooks.

<ul><li> The Hand is especially nasty, since they can raise the dead. Even <em>death</em> isn't an escape.
</li><li> One that deserves special note was the Scourges of the Underworld, the murderous vigilantes that target super-villains, because this policy was what led to their undoing. One recruit, Priscilla Lyons, couldn't bring herself to kill her first mark and wanted out, but she knew they'd be after her; prior to this, <em>every</em> would-be defector (or failure, or even members who were in danger of being caught) had been killed by the others before they could spill any of the groups secrets. But she was smarter than the others. She quickly called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> hotline, and got in contact with USAgent, and as a result, they both brought the entire organization down. (A few "lone wolf" Scourges have shown up since then, but the actual organization does not appear to have ever recovered.)

During a crisis, Mitchell's second-in-command starts saying he's going to quit, only for Mitchell to interrupt forcefully and say he needs him because he needs someone questioning him every step of the way, even if he can't always agree.
</li><li> Late in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, the Marvel villain the Purple Man had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">Cut Lex Luthor a Check</a> epiphany. He realized that he didn't really need to be a supervillain to get what he wanted, because he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Compelling Voice</a> (actually, super-pheromones, but it works the same), so people would just hand him whatever he wanted, and thank him for the privilege. So he tried to quit being a villain and take up a life of hedonistic debauchery. Cue almost a decade of stories in which some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>) would track him down and force him to help with their latest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilScheme">Evil Scheme</a>. Since then, he's apparently become resigned to his fate, and his last several appearances have shown him trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nextwave">Nextwave</a></em> sees Dirk Anger contemplating/attempting various suicide methods.

<ul><li> Stop-loss policies in the military allow the army to keep you in it past the time you (think you) agreed to enlist for and can even stop you from transferring to somewhere else. These are usually enacted when recruiting is low and the military is busy in several places around the world. People want to leave active duty, but are prevented from doing so.
<ul><li> In addition, they can recall you to active duty for a time after you are discharged from the service, but the period of time in which they can do so is spelled out in the enlistment contract. During that period of time, you are considered to be a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeGuard">The Reserves.</a> Retired officers, on the other hand, <em>can</em> be recalled to duty at any time. Though practically speaking, at some point a retired officer would be considered too old to be fit for military service, even in desk duty. So even in the event of a dire national emergency, the odds of being recalled to duty shrink dramatically the longer you've been retired.
</li><li> The truth is that when enlisting in the United States armed forces, you <em>do</em> agree to enlist for the entire duration of stop-loss and inactive ready reserve. Your enlistment contract is absolutely unambiguous about the possibility of stop-loss and inactive ready reserve. Now, <em>recruiters</em> and the personnel handing you the contract are usually quite loathe to bring up the topic for some reason...
</li><li> To leave the Canadian Forces before your contract expires you need to submit a Voluntary Release Memo, which begins with the phrase "I, [Rank and name], <em>request</em> a voluntary release" for a reason. It's rare for such a thing to be rejected, but if they still need you you're not going anywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> This is quite standard for criminal gangs and syndicates the world over. Once you join a criminal organization, you're in it for life, and the only way to leave it is in a body bag... unless you're willing to turn yourself over to the authorities. Only a few individuals have ever been lucky to leave alive. Prison gangs in particular have a "blood in, blood out" policy &mdash; joining the gang frequently requires spilling the blood of someone from a rival gang (blood in), and once you're in the gang, the only way out is death, either at the hands of the gang or at the end of your natural life (blood out).
</li><li> Some countries forbid their heads of state to quit office, even if it's the only thing they can ethically do. The closest example of this trope is Mexico, since the Mexican Constitution states the only way a Mexican president can be able to quit office is being judged for federal crimes (like high treason) or dying due to natural causes or accidents. This law was created after the Mexican Revolution for preventing a president from quitting so easily and for avoiding coups d'etat - see the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Lascur%C3%A1in">Pedro Lascur&aacute;in case<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19gfm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19gfm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19gfm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Victoriano Huerta ousted the President and the next two people in line in 1913. To maintain some kind of legality, Huerta got Lascur&aacute;in, being the person highest in the line of succession that was still there, to succeed as president&mdash;for just 45 minutes. What Lascur&aacute;in did is essentially name Huerta to the office that is next to the line after himself, and then resign himself.</span> However, the term of office was fixed to 6 years, so they're not stuck for life. According to Wikileaks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">there is a way for a Mexican president to quit office</a>, but it implies suspending the Constitution (so any laws regarding the presidential mandate will become void), and no Mexican president will resort to that, even in the most dire of circumstances, since it could be used against the president theself at any time.
</li><li> Uniquely among modern European monarchs, the British sovereign cannot unilaterally abdicate. They may declare an intent to abdicate, but may only leave office after receiving the permission of the Commonwealth governments to do so. The historical basis for this is that one of the main points of contention after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a> was who got to decide the succession to the throne, and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup">The Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, the question was decisively settled in favour of Parliament having the sole right to decide who gets to be King (or Queen). The UK and then the other Commonwealth Realms inherited this principle from the English (and Scots, who adopted it at the same time). <br><br>When Edward VIII abdicated, it took a full day for the then six Commonwealth Realms<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20htm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note20htm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20htm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK itself</span> to complete the paperwork, with one of the Realms (Ireland) intentionally taking an extra day as a gesture of independence and as a convenient excuse to mostly write the monarch out of their constitution.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qoau');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3qoau" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qoau');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Irish government of the time was led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeMinistersOfIreland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeMinistersOfIreland">Eamon de Valera,</a> a Nationalist Republican who would have liked to get rid of the monarchy entirely, but recognized that to be politically impossible at that time.</span> If any future monarch declared an intention to abdicate it would take much longer to obtain approval. In 1936, The UK parliament was able to legislate for the realms on such affairs as long as the prime ministers of the other realms agreed, but today it would require legislation to be passed in 8 of the 16 realms individually.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note46cqq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note46cqq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note46cqq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The constitutions for the other 8 realms explicitly state they will have the same monarch as the UK, so they don't need to change local laws as long as UK changes its own laws.</span>In Australia and Canada, moreover, it further requires the consent of all States/Provinces. <br><br>For an example on how difficult this can be: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Agreement">In 2011<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the Commonwealth realms agreed to change the rules of succession so that brothers did not automatically take precedence over sisters. Most realms passed legislation allowing this in 2013 but it wasn't fully in place until March 2015. Why? Blame the legislature of Western Australia, which didn&#146;t get around to voting on the matter until earlier that month; only at that point could the Australian Commonwealth government commence the federal legislative process.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vk1u');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5vk1u" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vk1u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Everyone <em>thought</em> that it would be the government of Quebec, which was run by "sovereigntists" 2012-14, trying to extract concessions, but the federal government has managed to get around the "every province" requirement for now; even if a suit by some Quebec activists manages to knock that down and force the federal government to let the provinces vote, Quebec is unlikely to cause problems as it will be run by the much more monarchy-friendly federalists for the next few years, as the sovereigntists <em>massively</em> shot themselves in the foot on other issues during their term in office.</span> And if (somehow) you find yourself in the line of succession but want out, don't think that you can avoid this mess by just stepping aside from your place in the succession: that, too is set by Parliament, and would also require an Act of Parliament (well, all the described Acts of many Parliaments) to modify. The only way someone can lose his/her place in the succession is to convert to Roman Catholicism, as it's written into the rules that nobody who is or has ever been a Catholic could be in remainder to the throne. This itself is no small undertaking, as while converting to Catholicism is easier than converting to, say, Judaism, they still make you go through several weeks to several months of courses to prove you're serious.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note693in');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note693in" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note693in');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Before 2015 one could also choose to marry a Roman Catholic but the religion of an heir's spouse no longer matters.</span>
</li><li> Technically the case for Members of Parliament in Britain. A rule dating from the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesVIAndI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesVIAndI">James VI and I</a> forbids resignation from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPoliticalSystem">House of Commons</a>. In those days, being an MP could be quite a hassle, especially for those representing rural constituencies far from London: you couldn't handle personal business back home and the trip to and from Westminster could only be conducted by poorly-maintained roads, and not to mention that before 1911, Members received no salary at all. And it was at the time not unusual for an MP to be elected <em>involuntarily</em>, providing further incentive to quit. As a result, the House passed a rule barring its members from resignation. However, as part of the Act of Settlement 1701, anyone holding an "office of profit under the Crown", i.e. a paid job in the executive or judicial branches of government, was disqualified from Parliament unless re-elected in a by-election; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">English Civil War</a> had made Parliament wary of royal influence on the Commons, and wanted to keep the king from controlling MPs by giving them jobs (if an MP's income depends in part on the king, he might be trusted to vote the king's way). This had two effects:
<ol><li> Until the early 20th century, any MP appointed to the Cabinet&mdash;including the Prime Minister&mdash;had to seek re-election in his constituency in order to hold the seat and the office. At first this wasn't a problem, since most Cabinet members were Lords anyway, but as the number of members of the Commons in the Government rose, an exemption was made for certain situations.
</li><li> One could once again indirectly resign from Parliament by taking a paid office under the Crown. Eventually, it became the custom to take the office of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or the office of Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, which had been sinecures with piddling pay for generations, as the means of resignation from the House. This has become so common that someone taking these offices is simply said to have resigned from Parliament in daily speech and the press.
<ul><li> In an amusing incident, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthernIreland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthernIreland">Northern Irish</a> Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who had been an (abstentionist) MP for Belfast West since 1997, decided to resign Parliament in 2011 to seek election to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IrishPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IrishPoliticalSystem">D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann</a>. When he won a seat at Leinster House, he submitted a letter of resignation to the Speaker but didn't apply for a Crown office, as he is opposed to the monarchy on principle. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's office (which handles these things) sent him a letter apologising and saying, essentially, "sorry, there's no other legal means for you to retire from the Commons, so here's your commission and your cheque for the pittance we technically have to pay you".
</li></ul></li></ol><ul><li> Most of these has been codified in the House of Commons Disqualification Act, where Section 2 provided at most 95 MPs can keep their seats while holding a ministerial position, and Section 4 specifically stated "the office of steward or bailiff of Her Majesty&#146;s three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham, or of the Manor of Northstead" are disqualifiable offices, but MPs "disqualified" this way may still enter elections while holding such positions.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCEstMoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCEstMoi">French kings</a> were banned from abdicating because of the principle of Indisponibility of the Crown, i.e. the king was banned from tampering with royal succession. This principle led to one of the stranger disputes within the royalist camp <em>after</em> the Revolution: Philippe, the second son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a>'s eldest son, had disclaimed his right to inherit the French throne in order to become Felipe V, King of Spain. For nearly two centuries, this mattered not one bit, as Philippe's elder brother's descendants held the throne until the Revolution, after which they were (usually) not anywhere near being on the throne. However, after the collapse of the Second French Empire in 1871, the Legitimists&mdash;the supporters of Philippe's older brother's line&mdash;had a plurality in the parliament of the supposedly-temporary Third Republic, and were waiting for the last member of that line (Charles, comte de Chambord) to either (a) come to his senses and reign as a constitutional monarch under the Tricolor or (b) die so that his heir could take the throne and do what Chambord refused to do. The issue of <em>who</em> that heir actually was split the Legitimist camp, with a majority supporting Philippe, comte de Paris (who was (1) the seniormost member of the House of Bourbon <em>if</em> you cut out the descendants of the Philippe who became King of Spain, because he was the heir by agnatic primogeniture of Louis XIV's younger brother; and (2) the preferred monarch of the somewhat more liberal Orl&eacute;anist monarchists, who had a majority between themselves and the Legitimists), but a distinct minority supporting the seniormost male-line descendant of Felipe V, on the grounds that Felipe had not the authority to disclaim his right to succeed to the French throne.
</li><li> One of the rules of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheShinsengumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheShinsengumi">The Shinsengumi</a> was that membership was for life.
</li><li> Supposedly, this is how ISIS works. Reports of would-be deserters being <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/200-islamic-state-fighters-killed-fleeing-battlefield-found-shallow-grave-say-reports-1575408">gassed or boiled alive<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for trying to flee have started to become common, as have reports of members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick">Playing Sick</a> simply to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aol.com/article/2016/09/02/isis-fighters-calling-in-sick/21464633/">avoid being killed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> On a national scale, once a state is in the United States, it's in for good. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> showed that secession was unacceptable as a practical matter, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts">the Supreme Court</a> later made it clear that it was also unconstitutional. (In theory, a state could exit the Union by means of a constitutional amendment, but that's rather different.)
<ul><li> In late 2017, Spain is sending the same message to Catalonia. The Spanish constitution is very explicit that secession is forbidden, and Spanish courts held that the Calatan regional government acted illegally by even <em>attempting</em> to hold a referendum on that subject.
</li></ul></li><li> One theory about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a>'s assassination holds it was the Nation of Islam pulling this on him after he repudiated their beliefs and converted to Sunni Islam.
</li><li> In a less gruesome version, many Asian sweatshops will hold onto their workers' first month's paycheck until they're given permission to leave their jobs, which in practice happens very rarely. While workers aren't technically prevented from quitting, they have to sacrifice an entire month's wages to do so, and the suggestion that they <em>might</em> someday be granted the elusive permission serves to discourage them from leaving without it.
</li><li> After John F. Wallace resigned after one year, and John F. Stevens resigned after two years, a frustrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> selected Major George Washington Goethels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">the Army Corps of Engineers</a> to be Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal, explaining that he wanted somebody who wouldn't be allowed to quit. Goethels took up his assignment with a sense of duty and saw the project through to completion
</li><li> A judge may deny attorneys request to resign from a case. Judge Furman denied motion for some Justice Department counsel to withdraw from the 2020 Census case after they resigned when the White House and DOJ continued to pursue the citizenship question despite the Supreme Court ruling to remove it.
</li><li> Since the ratification of Japan's current constitution in the aftermath of World War II, the Emperor is legally not allowed to abdicate the throne. When Emperor Akihito wanted to abdicate the throne due to him feeling he was too old to do the job, it took years of debate for the Diet (the Japanese parliament) to pass an exception to the law for him. In the past however, abdicating the throne was very common and expected of the Emperor to do once he (or she) became old, with more Emperors having abdicated the throne than dying on it.
